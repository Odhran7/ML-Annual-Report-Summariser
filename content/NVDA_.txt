 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k purchasing or owning nvidia common stock involves investment risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

risks related to our industry and markets 

if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or to identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted 

our accelerated computing platforms address four large markets gaming data center professional visualization and automotive these markets experience rapid changes in technology customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and industry standards 

our strategic and business success depends on our ability to 

• timely identify emerging industry changes and develop new or enhance existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets 

• expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies 

• accurately forecast demand in our businesses 

• meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change 

• manage product software and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction 

• develop infrastructure needed to scale our business including related to our acquisitions customer support ecommerce and ip licensing capabilities and 

• complete technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities 

we make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years if at all if we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if they do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

achieving design wins which is important to our success in several businesses may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations furthermore a design win does not guarantee revenue 

we cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve our business will be harmed 

competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue 

our target markets remain competitive and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings industry standards customer needs new entrants and consolidations our competitors’ products services and technologies such as the highend discrete gpus offered by intel and amd may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our products some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive ip portfolios and patent protections new designs and more design wins and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends more quickly transition their products and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supplyconstrained environment which could harm our business in our networking business some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have inhouse expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of ip rights that may enable such customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing if we are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline 

risks related to demand supply and manufacturing 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly there may be a mismatch between supply and demand and our financial results could be harmed 

demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions and transitions time to market competitor product releases and announcements competing technologies and other factors all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue we sell many of our products through channel partners who sell to retailers distributors andor end customers as a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast demand 

gpus have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case such as for digital currency mining including blockchainbased platforms such as ethereum it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining on demand for our products volatility in the cryptocurrency market including new compute technologies price changes in cryptocurrencies government cryptocurrency policies and regulations new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending ethereum 20 standard may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our gpus impact retail prices for our gpus increase returns of our products in the distribution channel and may reduce demand for our new gpus we have introduced lite hash rate or lhr geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of cmp in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to cmp however if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our lhr cards are successful our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners increasing demand for our gaming gpus and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to nonmining customers we cannot predict whether our strategy of using lhr cards and cmp will achieve our desired outcome in addition our products may be resold on the unauthorized “gray market” which also makes demand forecasting difficult gray market products compete with our distribution channels 

consumer and enterprise behavior during the covid19 pandemic such as increased demand for our gaming data center and workstation products has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand these challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside 

our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases extend to be twelve months or longer which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand we have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and longterm supply and capacity needs these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory demand for our products may be perishable or may disappear which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to lose market share perhaps permanently to shorten shipment lead times we may build finished products and carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors we may writedown our 

inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand 

situations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include 

• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy and changes in the credit market 

• higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements 

• new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases 

• increase in demand for competitive products including competitive actions 

• fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining or 

• decrease in future demand decrease in the cost of supply chain materials or changes in the design of future products where we have entered into longterm supply commitments including prepayments particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times andor before the design of those products is final 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

in periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry andor limited supply or capacity in our supply chain as we are in today we have placed and may continue to place noncancellable inventory orders in advance of our historical lead times and pay premiums andor provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity for example while we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and longterm supply and capacity needs however we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will end nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs these actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in longterm demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test package or design our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business 

we do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility we depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques we do not assemble test or package our products but instead contract with independent subcontractors we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools while we may enter into longterm supply and capacity commitments we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs we face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain negatively impact longerterm demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

• lack of guaranteed supply of wafers components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner 

• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products 

• failure by our foundries to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products 

• limited number of global suppliers foundries contract manufacturers assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers 

• loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier 

• lack of direct control over product quantity quality and delivery schedules 

• delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours and 

• low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications or as new versions are released some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise writeoff the value of related inventory and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance loss of design wins and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand which would in turn negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including for costs to repair or replace products in the field if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

risks related to our global operating business 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations including adverse economic conditions which may harm our business 

we conduct our business and have offices worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and we generated 84 of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the united states the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

• domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business 

• differing legal standards with respect to protection of ip and employment practices 

• domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ 

• disruptions to capital markets andor currency fluctuations and 

• natural disasters acts of war or other military actions terrorism public health issues and other catastrophic events 

adverse changes in global regional or local economic conditions including recession or slowing growth changes or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rates tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditures by businesses including on it infrastructure increases in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending periodically occur more recently increased inflation may impact supply employee facilities and infrastructure costs to the extent such inflation continues increases or both it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

economic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse wideranging effects on our business and financial results including 

• decrease in demand for our products services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees 

• the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us 

• our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers andor end users 

• the insolvency of key suppliers distributors customers or licensees 

• limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions 

• difficulties in obtaining capital 

• reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations 

• lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and 

• increased credit and collectability risks higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets reduced liquidity adverse impacts on our suppliers failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments 

we have engineering sales support operations and manufacturing located in israel the state of israel and companies with business in israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the state of israel and companies with israeli operations such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers partners and vendors water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical we have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk these measures can have adverse implications for our santa clara california headquarter offices and data centers including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively climate change its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we our customers partners and our vendors do business may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and costs to maintain or resume operations although we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations products and services as well as those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climaterelated laws regulations and lawsuits regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes increased levels of capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our 

operations and product design activities stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm we may not achieve our stated goal to source 100 of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025 which could harm our reputation or we may incur additional unexpected costs to achieve such a goal we may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate changerelated disruptions which could result in increased litigation and costs 

we also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns we may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products such as our gpus despite their energy efficient design and operation andor increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products could negatively impact our business 

we may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives 

acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results given that our resources are limited if we pursue a particular transaction we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives if we are unable to timely complete acquisitions including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals we may be unable to pursue other transactions we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business for example on february 8 2022 nvidia and softbank announced the termination of the share purchase agreement whereby nvidia would have acquired arm from softbank the parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction we intend to record in operating expenses a 136 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the writeoff of the prepayment provided at signing in september 2020 in addition to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed future acquisitions may be more difficult complex or expensive further if we hold investments in publicly traded companies they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment 

risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to 

• difficulty in integrating the technology products or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business 

• diversion of capital and other resources including management’s attention 

• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets 

• integrating accounting forecasting and controls procedures and reporting cycles 

• coordinating and integrating operations particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate 

• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all 

• difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing 

• stock price impact fines fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition 

• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment 

• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions resulting in increased debt increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions 

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities 

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performancebased consideration 

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate 

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring and 

• impairment of relationships with or loss of our or our target’s employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware socialengineering attacks denialofservice attacks software bugs server malfunctions software or hardware failures loss of data or other information technology assets and other cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to successfully detect defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures 

for example on february 23 2022 we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by a group of independent criminal threat actors not affiliated with any government or political cause the threat actors obtained nvidia network credentials and through deception obtained twofactor authentication capability and access to our network the threat actors misappropriated certain nvidia proprietary information including nvidia source code and leaked some of that information online upon learning of the security incident we engaged in remedial and preventative actions rotated all nvidia network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access hardened our network analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated and notified law enforcement and other authorities 

cyberattacks including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors nationstates and nationstatesupported actors may become more prevalent and severe our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible 

threat actors sophisticated nationstates and nationstatesupported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks due to increasing geopolitical conflicts we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyberattacks furthermore we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems including without limitation cloudbased infrastructure encryption and authentication technology employee email and other functions which exposes us to supplychain attacks or other business disruptions we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems including our products and services or the thirdparty information technology systems that support our services our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited and these may not have adequate information security measures in place in addition if one of our thirdparty suppliers suffers a security breach our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems logs and other information related to the security breach 

to defend against cyberattacks we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which is expected to result in increased expenses we must also continue to develop our security measures ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers we may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in our security controls systems or software including thirdparty software we have installed as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred further we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities 

breaches of our security measures along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business if we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident we may experience adverse consequences including government enforcement actions additional reporting requirements andor oversight restrictions on processing data litigation indemnification obligations reputational harm diversion of funds financial 

loss loss of data material disruptions in our systems and operations supply chain and ability to produce sell and distribute our goods and services and other similar harms inability to fulfill orders delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

business disruptions could harm our operations lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures cloud service provider outages terrorist attacks or acts of violence political andor civil unrest acts of war or other military actions epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters and catastrophic events our corporate headquarters a large portion of our current data center capacity and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally political instability changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations for example the invasion by russia of ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our employees or operations both within and outside these regions and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues for example our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if the conflict between russia and ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers including our foundry partners require to satisfy our needs the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a disaster war or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributors and partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels our operating results depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis our customers can cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty our partners or customers may develop their own solutions our customers may purchase products from our competitors and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns the loss of any of our large customers a significant reduction in purchases by them our inability to sell to a customer due to us trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees our business may be harmed 

to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders cost inflation the covid19 pandemic and workforce participation rates we also must recruit and develop diverse talent changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our business may be adversely affected competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation we also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team failure to ensure effective succession planning transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and longterm success 

our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business processes and internal controls 

we rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth including for acquisitions of other businesses we expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning or erp system any erp system problems upon implementation such as quality issues or programming errors could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time failure to implement new or updated controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls even if quickly remediated once disclosed may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remediate any material weakness our financial statements may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statements our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital markets may be restricted the trading price of our common stock may decline and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

covid19 has impacted and continues to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers partners vendors and suppliers as the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty and the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical services may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results while covid19 has driven an increase in sales for certain of our products the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change covid19 containment around the world has put restrictions on among other areas manufacturing facilities commerce and support operations could limit our capacity to meet customer demand stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain which could increase our costs limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes 

covid19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict it has resulted in and may continue to result in disruption of global financial markets which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity volatility in the financial markets could impact overall technology spending adversely affecting demand for our products our business and the value of our common stock 

we have modified our business and workforce practices in response to covid19 and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers there is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed when we begin to reopen our offices we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related inoffice costs 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations and access to sources of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors therefore investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance additional factors that could affect our results of operations include but are not limited to 

• our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services 

• our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations 

• the inability of some customers to make required payments our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers and customer bad debt writeoffs 

• unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities and 

• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject and political and other actions may adversely impact our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement taxes import and export requirements and tariffs anticorruption business acquisitions foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements competition and antitrust advertising employment product regulations cybersecurity environmental health and safety requirements the responsible use of ai climate change cryptocurrency and consumer laws compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive could impact our competitive position and may impact our business operations negatively for example the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate policies controls and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation should any of these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs andor restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business for example we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anticompetition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations 

government actions including trade protection and national security policies of us and foreign government bodies such as tariffs import or export regulations including deemed export restrictions trade and economic sanctions decrees quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products provide services to our customers and employees do business without an export license with entities on the us department of commerce’s us entity list or other us government restricted parties lists which is expected to change from time to time and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business for example in response to the russian invasion of ukraine the united states and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control measures which have and could in the future result in among other things severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings involving russia certain regions of ukraine andor particular entities and individuals such actions have limited or blocked or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products services and support into russia or other regions determined to be supporting russia and restrict access by our russian or ukrainian employees both within and outside of russia and ukraine to our systems negatively impacting productivity given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the united states and foreign government bodies we recently ceased product sales to russia while we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions our employees contractors partners and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible if we were ever found to have violated us export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition additionally changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide including but not limited to taiwan china hong kong israel and korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies export controls import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability the increasing focus on the strategic importance of ai technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products 

and services capable of enabling or facilitating ai including some or all of our product and service offerings such restrictions could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial results deemed export control limitations could negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner 

recent restrictions imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our gaming business additionally revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments 

issues relating to the responsible use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability 

concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies such as ai in our products and services may result in reputational harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues we are increasingly building ai capabilities into many of our products and services ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai poses emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of ai models and systems offered through our sales channels we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability compliance with government regulation in the area of ai ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of ai by us or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services or cause reputational harm 

increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental social and governance responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us 

shareholder advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds other market participants shareholders and customers have focused increasingly on the esg and sustainability practices of companies including those associated with climate change and human rights these parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments if our esg practices do not meet shareholder or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our brand reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters including corporate governance environmental compliance employee health and safety practices human capital management product quality supply chain management and talent diversity and inclusion practices it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of their adoption we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices or choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies also our failure or perceived failure to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities 

actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

from time to time we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other ip rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages invalidation of one or more patents indemnification of third parties payment of lost profits or injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel 

we may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our ip rights which may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results we could be subject to countersuits as a result if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s ip we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s ip rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable 

terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

we rely on patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our ip foreign laws may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as united states law this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we also may face risks to our ip if our employees are hired by potential competitors we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

we are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations industry standards external and internal policies contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters including for use in ai even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr and the united kingdom similarly adopted the uk gdpr governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the european economic area or eea and the united kingdom respectively including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access correct and delete such data about themselves if we are found not to comply we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4 of worldwide revenue whichever is greater and individuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data furthermore there exists a proposed european regulation related to ai that if adopted could impose onerous obligations and could require us to change our business practices 

certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and crossborder personal data transfer laws for example the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the eea the european commission released a set of “standard contractual clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the eea to jurisdictions that the european commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection including the united states other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar crossborder personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business the inability to import personal data to the united states could significantly and negatively impact our business operations limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to european and other data privacy and security laws or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in europe andor elsewhere at significant expense 

the united states federal state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws including for data breach notification personal data privacy and consumer protection the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa gives california residents the right to access delete and optout of certain sharing of their personal information and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared the ccpa allows for statutory fines of up to 7500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches california’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the california privacy rights act of 2020 or cpra which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information further restrict the use of crosscontextual advertising techniques restrict the retention of personal information expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action and establish the california privacy protection agency to impose administrative fines virginia passed the consumer data protection act and colorado passed the colorado privacy act both of which differ from the cpra and become effective in 2023 if we become subject to new data privacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional obligations 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is 

inconsistent with our data practices these obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf despite our efforts our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations if we fail or are perceived to have failed to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations we could face significant consequences including but not limited to government enforcement actions litigation additional reporting requirements andor oversight bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business or financial condition 

we have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions for example we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in germany israel and india although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows further changes in united states federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current us administration and congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development or oecd may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act or tcja starting in fiscal year 2023 the tcja requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years if congress does not modify or repeal this provision it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023 furthermore recent proposals to increase the us corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income increase us taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates numerous countries as well as organizations such as the oecd support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business which could materially impact our results of operations 

our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings 

we currently and will likely continue to face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business for example we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false andor misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in 2017 and 2018 litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or fines or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations our business is subject to laws and 

regulations that are complex and change frequently we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in or remedy violations of these laws and regulations 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations 

as of january 30 2022 we had outstanding a total of 11 billion in notes due by 2060 as each series of senior notes matures unless earlier redeemed or repurchased we have to repay or refinance the notes if we decide to refinance we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition we also have a 575 million commercial paper program 

maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and restrict our ability to grant liens on property enter into certain mergers dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or materially change our business 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing 

delaware law and our certificate of incorporation bylaws and agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock change the number of directors and to make amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals and a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws in 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft to develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock these provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

overview 

our company and our businesses 

nvidia pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems since our original focus on pc graphics we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3d graphics and the scale of the gaming market nvidia has leveraged its gpu architecture to create platforms for scientific computing ai data science av robotics ar and vr 

our two operating segments are graphics and compute  networking refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

termination of the arm share purchase agreement 

on february 8 2022 nvidia and softbank announced the termination of the share purchase agreement whereby nvidia would have acquired arm from softbank the parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction we intend to record in operating expenses a 136 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the writeoff of the prepayment provided at signing in september 2020 

demand 

demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions time to market transitions competitor product releases and announcements and competing technologies all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue gpus have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case such as for digital currency mining including blockchainbased platforms such as ethereum it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining on demand for our products volatility in the cryptocurrency market including new compute technologies price changes in cryptocurrencies government cryptocurrency policies and regulations and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending ethereum 20 standard may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our gpus impact retail prices for our gpus increase returns of our products in the distribution channel and may reduce demand for our new gpus we have introduced lhr geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of cmp in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to cmp beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 nearly all our desktop nvidia ampere architecture geforce gpu shipments were lhr in our effort to direct geforce to gamers if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our lhr cards are successful our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to nonmining customers we cannot predict whether our strategy of using lhr cards and cmp will achieve our desired outcome additionally consumer and enterprise behavior during the covid19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed prepandemic behaviors and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis in estimating demand and evaluating trends we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect 

supply 

our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases extend to be twelve months or longer which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain to 

have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build finished products and maintain inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur anticipating demand that does not materialize or for what we believe is pentup demand during fiscal year 2022 we made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand we expect to remain supplyconstrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023 primarily in gaming and networking we have placed noncancellable inventory orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future ordering product in advance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in longterm demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors given our long lead times on inventory purchasing demand may be perishable or may disappear given our current long lead times we may order components before our product design is finalized and changes to the product design or end demand could trigger excess inventory our supply deliveries and production may be nonlinear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash flows 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022 most of our employees continue to work remotely and we have paused most business travel during fiscal year 2022 our gaming data center and professional visualization market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work learn and play from home our professional visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments as our offices begin to reopen we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related inoffice costs 

as the covid19 pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customers the availability of supply chain logistical services and component supply and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results 

we believe our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities along with commercial paper arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital asset purchases dividends debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations 

fiscal year 2022 summary 



we specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications these platforms incorporate processors interconnects software algorithms systems and services to deliver unique value our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical gaming data center professional visualization and automotive 

revenue for fiscal year 2022 was 2691 billion up 61 from a year ago 

gaming revenue was up 61 from a year ago reflecting higher sales of geforce gpus we continue to benefit from strong demand for nvidia ampere architecture products and believe the increase in gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors including the ramp of new rtx 30 series gpus the release of new games supporting ray tracing the rising popularity of gaming esports content creation and streaming the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining 

although nearly all desktop nvidia ampere architecture geforce gpu shipments are lhr to help direct geforce gpus to gamers our gpus are capable of cryptocurrency mining gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our gpus although we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall gpu demand volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transactions such as proof of work or proof of stake can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it we are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future 

data center revenue was up 58 from a year ago primarily driven by sales of nvidia ampere architecture gpus across both training and inference for cloud computing and ai workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models 

professional visualization revenue was up 100 from a year ago driven by the ramp of nvidia ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments as well as growth in workloads such as 3d design ai and rendering 

automotive revenue was up 6 from a year ago due to selfdriving and ai cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue 

oem and other revenue was up 84 from a year ago primarily driven by cmp sales cmp revenue was 550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year 

revenue for our cmp products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market as discussed above is likely to have on future cmp sales 

gross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower mellanox acquisitionrelated charges including a nonrecurring inventory stepup charge of 161 million in fiscal year 2021 margins also benefited from a higherend mix within gaming partially offset by a mix shift within data center 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27 from a year ago primarily driven by stockbased compensation compensationrelated costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs 

income from operations was 1004 billion up 122 from a year ago net income and net income per diluted share were 975 billion and 385 up 125 and 123 respectively from a year ago 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 2121 billion up from 1156 billion a year earlier the increase reflects operating cash flow generation and 500 billion of debt issuance proceeds 

we paid 399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to inventories revenue recognition income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases failure to estimate customer demand properly ordering in advance of historical leadtimes and the impact of changes in future demand or increase in demand for competitive products including competitive actions cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 09 in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021 as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases extend on to be twelve months or longer which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand we place noncancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements software licensing and cloud services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract where revenue is 

allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

product sales revenue 

revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system hardware andor software support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers 

for products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers 

license and development arrangements 

our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our ip components as a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 30 2022 we had a valuation allowance of 907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value as of january 30 2022 the total carrying amount of goodwill was 435 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our graphics and compute  networking reporting units was 361 million and 399 billion respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

we performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 filed with the sec on february 26 2021 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov and at our investor relations website httpinvestornvidiacom 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

revenue by reportable segments 



graphics  graphics segment revenue increased by 61 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 we continue to benefit from strong demand for nvidia ampere architecture products and believe the increase in gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors including the ramp of new rtx 30 series gpus the release of new games supporting ray tracing the rising popularity of gaming esports content creation and streaming the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining 

compute  networking  compute  networking segment revenue increased by 61 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 driven primarily by sales of nvidia ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models as well as to vertical industries the increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as mellanox was acquired in april 2020 cmp contributed 550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 84 and 81 of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs tariffs and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes acquisitionrelated costs development costs for license and service arrangements iprelated costs and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 649 and 623 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to lower mellanox acquisitionrelated charges including a nonrecurring inventory stepup charge of 161 million in fiscal year 2021 the increase also benefited from a higherend mix within graphics partially offset by a mix shift within compute  networking 

inventory provisions totaled 354 million and 116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 111 million and 145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 09 in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021 

the gross margin of our graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higherend mix within geforce gpus 

the gross margin of our compute  networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to a shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from automotive solutions 

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 34 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily driven by stockbased compensation compensationrelated costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 12 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily driven by stockbased compensation compensationrelated costs associated with employee growth partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles 

other income expense net 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income was 29 million and 57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments 

interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes interest expense was 236 million and 184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase in expense reflects interest on the 500 billion note issued in june 2021 

other net consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in nonaffiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates other net was an income of 107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021 the increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in nonaffiliated entities refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our investments in nonaffiliated entities 

income taxes 

we recognized income tax expense of 189 million and 77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively our annual effective tax rate was 19 and 17 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively 

the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to us tax and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the us federal research tax credit partially offset by the benefit of the foreignderived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary or the domestication 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 due to tax benefits from the foreignderived intangible income deduction income earned in jurisdictions including the british virgin islands and israel that are subject to taxes lower than the us federal statutory tax rate excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation recognition of us federal research tax credit and the onetime benefits of the domestication 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including the british virgin islands israel and hong kong where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate recognition of us federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information including the domestication 

liquidity and capital resources 





as of january 30 2022 we had 2121 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 965 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021 our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities the diversification of investment types and credit exposures and certain maturity limits on our portfolio 

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 due to higher net income partially offset by changes in working capital changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of 187 billion for longterm supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher revenue 

cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021 reflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of mellanox in fiscal year 2021 and higher marketable securities sales and maturities partially offset by higher purchases of marketable securities 

cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021 which primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units 

liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents our marketable securities and the cash generated by our operations as of january 30 2022 we had 2121 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future including our future supply obligations and additional supply we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources including our access to external capital to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements 

our marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the us government and its agencies highly rated corporations and financial institutions and foreign government entities these marketable securities are primarily denominated in us dollars refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

during fiscal year 2023 we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents our marketable securities and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately 14 billion related to property and equipment 

we have approximately 14 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the us for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the us other than that substantially all of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the us as of january 30 2022 are available for use in the us without incurring additional us federal income taxes following the domestication we 

have utilized almost all of our accumulated us federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022 resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023 in addition beginning in fiscal year 2023 the tcja requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years this will impact cash flows from operations and result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023 refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

capital return to shareholders 

in fiscal year 2022 we paid 399 million in quarterly cash dividends our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our boards continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders 

as of january 30 2022 we were authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to 724 billion through december 2022 we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022

refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

we have unrecognized tax benefits of 729 million which includes related interest and penalties of 59 million recorded in noncurrent income tax payable as of january 30 2022 we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability interest payments or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses 

as of january 30 2022 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 taking into account a zero percent yield floor would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of 33 million or an increase in fair value for these investments of 22 million respectively 

at january 30 2022 we had 1100 billion of senior notes outstanding we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollar these forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense 

if the us dollar strengthened by 10 as of january 30 2022 and january 31 2021 the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 103 million and 84 million lower as of january 30 2022 and january 31 2021 respectively change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized 

if an adverse 10 foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately 41 million and 44 million as of january 30 2022 and january 31 2021 respectively these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances

seasonality 

our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as enterprise and cloud data centers consumer gaming professional workstations and automotive our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year in addition based on the production schedules of key customers some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products instead we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing additionally we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as amkor technology byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co king yuan electronics co ltd omni logistics llc and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we use contract manufacturers such as flex ltd to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems and fabrinet to manufacture our cables we purchase substrates from ibiden co ltd kinsus interconnect technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from micron technology samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynix 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and configuration and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and addin card or aic customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong israel and the united states generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aic solutions 

we also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as flex ltd and fabrinet and odms such as wistron corporation to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key 

elements such as the gpu soc memory and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process 

competition 

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus including intel’s recent announcement that they will introduce high performance gpus embedded socs and other accelerated ai computing processor products and providers of semiconductorbased highperformance interconnect products based on infiniband ethernet fibre channel and proprietary technologies some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes we expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022 

our current competitors include 

• suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated gpus and other accelerated computing solutions including chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics or hpc such as advanced micro devices or amd intel corporation and xilinx inc 

• large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates hpc or accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms such as alphabet inc and amazon inc 

• suppliers of soc products that are embedded into automobiles autonomous machines and gaming devices such as ambarella inc amd broadcom inc intel qualcomm incorporated renesas electronics corporation samsung and xilinx or companies with internal teams designing soc products for internal use such as tesla motors and

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from march 2021 to june 2045 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

• the location in which our products are manufactured 

• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries 

• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions and 

• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions 

we have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

government regulations 

our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws rules and regulations of the united states as well as of foreign governments compliance with these laws rules and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures results of operations or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities nevertheless compliance with existing or future governmental regulations including but not limited to those pertaining to global trade business acquisitions consumer and data protection employee health and safety and taxes could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods refer to “item 1a risk factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts 

human capital management

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers additionally if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies furthermore winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any 

competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue 

our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products in addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive ip portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business in our networking business some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have inhouse expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them consequently these customers may become competitors to us further each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 

risks related to our supply and manufacturing 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors in the past we have not had and going forward we may not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors nevertheless we may enter into longterm procurement and capacity commitments 

as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain as our business grows we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand scale our supply chain andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

• a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities andor in a timely manner 

• a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products 

• a failure by our foundries to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis 

• a limited number of suppliers including foundries assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers 

• loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier 

• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality and 

• delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise 

in addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products including both hardware and software offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs writeoff the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in 

failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

risks related to our operating business 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long this could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain we sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers as a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain we may place noncancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial results demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions and transitions competitor announcements and competing technologies all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue for example our gpus for gaming are capable of digital currency mining demand and use of gpus for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending ethereum 20 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our gpus and may reduce demand for our new gpus additionally consumer behavior during the covid19 pandemic such as increased demand for our gaming data center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect if we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products our business and financial results could be adversely impacted situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

• changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy 

• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market 

• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products 

• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements 

• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products 

• less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or 

• increased competition including competitive pricing actions 

the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events in such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware phishing and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems for example in 2020 solarwinds inc one of our third party software service providers was subject to a data security breach to date our investigations of this breach which were supported by a third party expert have not identified any adverse impact to nvidia data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems to defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expenses we must also continue to develop security measures within nvidia ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics including but not limited to covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations” our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china hong kong israel and korea additionally a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through hong kong israel and taiwan geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the united states or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability in particular revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement 

could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments for example regulations to implement the export control reform act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel in addition geopolitical and domestic political developments such as existing and potential trade wars political or social unrest elections and postelection developments and other events beyond our control can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets political instability changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages other negative impacts from climate change information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

covid19 has spread worldwide resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and our partners and those of our respective vendors and suppliers including our subcontractors and thirdparty contract manufacturers our critical business operations including our headquarters most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by covid19 our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by covid19 related restrictions and closures 

the covid19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty it continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 our gaming and data center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work learn and play from home our professional visualization market platform benefited from workfromhome trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover although not back to precovid levels in our automotive market platform covid19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 in some regions markets or industries where covid19 has driven an increase in sales for our products the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change additionally stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain particularly in gaming which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes pay higher prices or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all as the covid19 pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results 

the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china hong kong israel and korea a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through hong kong israel and taiwan additionally our headquarters is located in california each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it including restrictions on manufacturing facilities commerce travel on our support operations or workforce or on our customers partners vendors and suppliers there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures such measures as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel mandatory workfromhome policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers most of our employees continue to work remotely there is no 

certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

while the extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruption of global financial markets which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases which could negatively affect our liquidity a recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of covid19 could impact overall technology spending adversely affecting demand for our products our business and the value of our common stock 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and continued spread of the pandemic its severity the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact availability of vaccines or other treatments further related restrictions on travel and the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer spending including any recession resulting from the pandemic all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration is uncertain 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments including the mellanox acquisition and the planned arm acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business we completed our acquisition of mellanox for approximately 7 billion in april 2020 in september 2020 we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of arm in a transaction valued at 40 billion the mellanox acquisition the planned arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives furthermore if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals we may be unable to pursue other transactions we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve making the acquisition less attractive and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business in addition we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments additional risks related to the mellanox acquisition the planned arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to 

• difficulty in combining the technology products or operations of the acquired business with our business 

• difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce including key employees 

• diversion of capital and other resources including management’s attention 

• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets 

• integrating financial forecasting and controls procedures and reporting cycles 

• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated 

• acquiring business challenges and risks including but not limited to disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures 

• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return if any return at all 

• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals other approvals or financing 

• the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition 

• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition 

• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment 

• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment 

• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities 

• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performancebased consideration 

• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all 

• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate 

• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations 

• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company and 

• impairment of relationships with or loss of our or our target’s employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributors and partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

• most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty 

• our partners may develop their own solutions 

• our customers may purchase products from our competitors or 

• our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products 

we could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to us trade restrictions the loss of any of our large customers a significant reduction in purchases by them or our inability to sell to a customer due to us trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations including adverse economic conditions which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states we allocate revenue 

to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for 81 of total revenue for fiscal year 2021 92 for fiscal year 2020 and 87 for fiscal year 2019 revenue from billings to china including hong kong was 23 of our revenue for fiscal year 2021 additionally as of january 31 2021 approximately 53 of our employees were located outside of the united states the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

• international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do business 

• unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions 

• differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices 

• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions including deemed export restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions 

• disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations 

• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits and 

• natural disasters public health issues including the covid19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor “the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations” above and other catastrophic events 

if our sales outside of the united states are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements competition advertising employment product regulations environment health and safety requirements and consumer laws compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacyrelated and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads 

although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation the technology industry is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

adverse changes in global regional or local economic conditions including recession or slowing growth changes or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rates tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditures by businesses including on it infrastructure increases in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending periodically occur the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty it is likely that the continued spread of covid19 will cause an economic slowdown and it is possible that it could cause a global recession adverse changes in economic conditions including as a result of the pandemic can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions including regarding prioritization of investments in our business a slowdown in economic growth could have adverse wideranging effects on our business and financial results including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us our inability to supply our products to our customers andor the 

inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users the insolvency of key suppliers customers or licensees delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees failures by counterparties andor negative effects on inventories uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets reduced liquidity adverse impacts on our suppliers failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments 

additionally we have engineering facilities corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel and the middle east may directly affect our business in addition the state of israel and companies with business in israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future other countries have in the past and may continue in the future to restrict business with the state of israel and companies with israeli operations further we are unable to ship products manufactured in israel to certain countries these laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business we also must recruit and develop diverse talent additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs we also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution we continue to evolve our business practices in response to the covid19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices that remain open if we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently andor in a timely manner their productivity could be impacted or we could fail to retain them 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

additional factors other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to 

• our ability to achieve volume production of our nextgeneration products 

• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services 

• fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and covid19 as discussed further in the risk factor “if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed” 

• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products 

• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing 

• our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations 

• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues 

• our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards 

• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products 

• inventory writedowns 

• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies 

• our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products including infiniband 

• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers 

• customer bad debt writeoffs 

• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities 

• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property 

• our ability to maintain and scale our business processes information systems and internal controls 

• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and 

• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters including for use in ai even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which required companies to meet requirements effective as of may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access correct and delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition california adopted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents the right to access delete and optout of certain sharing of their personal information and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared violations of the ccpa carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches which is expected to increase data breach litigation california’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective january 1 2023 as a result of california voters approving the california privacy rights act of 2020 or cpra in the november 2020 election the cpra will among other things restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information further restrict the use of crosscontextual advertising techniques establish restrictions on the retention of personal information expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action and establish the california privacy protection agency to implement and enforce the new law as well as impose administrative fines since the enactment of the ccpa more than half of the states in the united states and the united states congress have considered proposed privacy legislation reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions for example we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the united kingdom germany israel and india although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may 

disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows further changes in united states federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tcja 

our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings 

we currently and may in the future face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business on a global basis for example we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false andor misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in 2017 and 2018 in addition multiple stockholders purporting to act on our behalf filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations 

in addition the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in or remedy violations of these laws and regulations 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

• the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval 

• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent 

• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals 

• the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval 

• a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and 

• the ability of our board of directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations 

in march 2020 we issued 150 billion of the 285 notes due 2030 100 billion of the 350 notes due 2040 200 billion of the 350 notes due 2050 and 500 million of the 370 notes due 2060 or collectively the march 2020 notes in september 2016 we issued 100 billion of the 220 notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the 320 notes due 2026 or collectively the september 2016 notes 

our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes additionally our obligation to make payments related to the notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1a risk factors” our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase hold or sell shares of our common stock 

overview 

our company and our businesses 

nvidia pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems starting with a focus on pc graphics we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of ai fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3d graphics and the scale of the gaming market nvidia leveraged its gpu architecture to create platforms for virtual reality hpc and ai 

through fiscal year 2020 our reportable segments were gpu and tegra processor we changed our reportable segments to graphics and compute  networking starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 

our graphics segment includes geforce gpus for gaming and pcs the geforce now game streaming service and related infrastructure and solutions for gaming platforms quadronvidia rtx gpus for enterprise workstation graphics vgpu software for cloudbased visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems 

our compute  networking segment includes data center platforms and systems for ai hpc and accelerated computing mellanox networking and interconnect solutions automotive ai cockpit autonomous driving development agreements and autonomous vehicle solutions and jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms 

all prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments our market platforms – gaming professional visualization data center automotive oem and other – remain unchanged 

headquartered in santa clara california nvidia was incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

pending acquisition of arm limited 

on september 13 2020 we entered into a purchase agreement with arm and softbank for us to acquire from softbank all allotted and issued ordinary shares of arm in a transaction valued at 40 billion we paid 2 billion in cash at signing or the signing consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition 10 billion in cash and issue to softbank 443 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of 215 billion the transaction includes a potential earn out which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by arm during the fiscal year ending march 31 2022 if the financial performance targets are achieved softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional 5 billion in cash or up to an additional 103 million shares of our common stock we will issue up to 15 billion in restricted stock units to arm employees after closing the 2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of 136 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from arm of 017 billion and royalties of 047 billion both with a 20year term the closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period and arms implementation of the reorganization and distribution of arm’s iot services group and certain other assets and liabilities we are engaged with regulators in the united states the united kingdom the european union china and other jurisdictions if the purchase agreement is terminated under certain circumstances we will be refunded 125 billion of the signing consideration the 2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the signing consideration will use stated values in the purchase agreement we believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022 

demand 

our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long this could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain we sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers as a result the decisions made 

by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain we may place noncancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial results demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions and transitions competitor announcements and competing technologies all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue for example our gpus for gaming are capable of digital currency mining demand and use of gpus for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending ethereum 20 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our gpus and may reduce demand for our new gpus additionally consumer behavior during the covid19 pandemic such as increased demand for our gaming data center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside in estimating demand and evaluating trends we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect 

covid19 

the worldwide covid19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel temporary business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders it has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets since march 2020 most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel 

our gaming and data center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work learn and play from home in professional visualization mobile workstations continue to benefit from workfromhome trends and desktop workstation demand has started to recover although not back to precovid levels in automotive covid is no longer having a significant impact on demand throughout our supply chain stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components particularly in gaming 

as the covid19 pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results refer to part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information under the heading “risk factors” 

we believe our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities along with commercial paper and other shortterm liquidity arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs capital asset purchases dividends debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations 

fiscal year 2021 summary 



revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 1668 billion up 53 from a year earlier 

from a marketplatform perspective gaming revenue was up 41 from a year ago reflecting higher sales across desktop and laptop gpus for gaming and gameconsole socs gpus for gaming benefited from the ramp of our geforce rtx 30 series based on the nvidia ampere architecture 

professional visualization revenue was down 13 from a year ago due to lower sales of gpus for desktop workstations as enterprise demand was impacted by covid 

data center revenue was up 124 from a year ago revenue growth was driven by our mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the nvidia ampere gpu architecture in fiscal year 2021 mellanox revenue contributed 10 of total company revenue 

automotive revenue was down 23 from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements partially offset by increases in ai cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions 

oem and other revenue was up 25 from a year ago primarily due to higher volume of entrylevel laptop gpus 

gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago primarily driven by product mix with higher data center and lower automotive revenue partially offset by mellanox acquisitionrelated charges 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were 586 billion up 50 from a year ago the growth was influenced by the inclusion of mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 employee additions and increases in employee compensation and related expenses additionally acquisitionrelated and other costs of 411 million primarily include 190 million in nonrecurring intangible amortization of mellanox order backlog 123 million in recurring amortization of mellanox intangible assets and 40 million related to the pending acquisition of arm 

income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was 453 billion up 59 from a year earlier net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were 433 billion and 690 up 55 and 53 respectively from a year earlier 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1156 billion as of january 31 2021 compared with 1090 billion as of january 26 2020 the increase primarily reflects the issuance of the 5 billion of notes in march 2020 and cashflow generation partially offset by acquisitions 

we paid 395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to business combinations inventories revenue recognition income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

business combinations 

the application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates in certain circumstances the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information including appraisals and other analyses accordingly the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information or the facts and circumstances becomes available but will not exceed twelve months we will recognize measurementperiod adjustments during the period of resolution including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date 

goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination we recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability intangible assets consist primarily of technology customer relationships order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and inprocess research and development or iprd we generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques to estimate fair value we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions including future economic and market conditions revenue growth technology migration curve and riskadjusted discount rates our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data various internal estimates and external sources our assessment of iprd also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or 

unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

product sales revenue 

revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers 

for products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers 

license and development arrangements 

our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components as a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change 

based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 31 2021 we had a valuation allowance of 728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we changed our reportable segments to graphics and compute  networking starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as a result our reporting units also changed and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values we determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization as of january 31 2021 the total carrying amount of goodwill was 419 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our graphics and compute  networking reporting units was 347 million and 385 billion respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

we performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 26 2020 filed with the sec on february 20 2020 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov and at our investor relations website httpinvestornvidiacom 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

revenue by reportable segments 



graphics  graphics segment revenue increased by 29 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting growth in geforce gpus and game console socs partially offset by lower sales of quadronvidia rtx workstations 

compute  networking  compute  networking segment revenue increased by 109 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting the addition of mellanox acquired on april 27 2020 and the continued ramp of nvidia ampere gpu architecture systems and new products 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 81 and 92 of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021 dell represented approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable primarily to the graphics segment 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs cost of 

revenue also includes acquisitionrelated costs development costs for license and service arrangements iprelated costs and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 623 and 620 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher data center and lower automotive revenue partially offset by mellanox acquisitionrelated charges including a nonrecurring inventory stepup charge of 161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of 263 million 

inventory provisions totaled 116 million and 161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020 as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

graphics  the gross margin of our graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within quadronvidia rtx 

compute  networking  the gross margin of our compute  networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by the addition of mellanox products higher margins in data center compute systems and lower product mix of certain automotive solutions 

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 39 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 driven primarily by the acquisition of mellanox in addition the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation and infrastructure costs 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 77 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 driven primarily by the mellanox acquisition in addition the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation 

other income expense net 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income was 57 million and 178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments 

interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our september 2016 notes and march 2020 notes interest expense was 184 million and 52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 

income taxes 

we recognized income tax expense of 77 million and 174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively our annual effective tax rate was 17 and 59 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to united states tax and an increase of tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including the british virgin islands israel and hong kong where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate recognition of us federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation

liquidity and capital resources 





as of january 31 2021 we had 1156 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020 our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities the diversification of investment types and credit exposures and certain maturity limits on our portfolio 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we paid 2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of arm which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of 136 billion the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from arm of 017 billion and royalties of 047 billion the cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in 136 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions net of cash acquired 017 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and 047 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets 

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 due to higher net income higher noncash adjustments partially offset by changes in working capital changes in working capital include increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue and a prepayment of royalties to arm 

cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020 which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of arm higher purchases of marketable securities higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower sales of marketable securities offset by higher maturities of marketable securities 

cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020 which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 offset by payments related to tax on restricted stock units 

liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents our marketable securities and the cash generated by our operations as of january 31 2021 we had 1156 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including our proposed acquisition of arm we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources including our access to external capital to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses 

as of january 31 2021 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 taking into account a yield floor of 0 would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of 24 million or an increase in fair value for these investments of 8 million respectively 

in september 2016 we issued 100 billion of the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the notes due 2026 in march 2020 we issued 150 billion of notes due 2030 100 billion of notes due 2040 200 billion of notes due 2050 and 500 million of notes due 2060 we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollar these forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense 

if the us dollar strengthened by 10 as of january 31 2021 and january 26 2020 the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 84 million and 43 million lower as of january 31 2021 and january 26 2020 respectively change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized 

if an adverse 10 foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately 44 million and 29 million as of january 31 2021 and january 26 2020 respectively these changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances

business strategies 

nvidia’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include 

advancing the gpu computing platform the massive parallel processing capabilities of nvidia gpus can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches indeed gpus can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable we work to deliver continued gpu performance leaps that outpace moore’s law by leveraging innovation across the architecture chip design system and software layers our strategy is to target markets where gpus deliver orderofmagnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches our market platforms so far include gaming professional visualization data center and automotive while 

the requirements of these end markets are diverse we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our gpus and cuda as the fundamental building blocks the programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in rd we can support several multibillion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners we utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets 

extending our technology and platform leadership in ai we provide a complete endtoend gpu computing platform for deep learning and machine learning addressing both training and inferencing this includes gpus our cuda programming language algorithms libraries and system software gpus are uniquely suited to ai and we will continue to add aispecific features to our gpu architecture to further extend our leadership position our ai technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle our gpu platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider as well as on our own ai supercomputer there are over 16 million developers worldwide using cuda and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets we evangelize ai through partnerships with hundreds of universities and more than 3600 startups through our inception program additionally our deep learning institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design train and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform 

extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing we believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing we apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create nearcinematic and vr experiences our close collaboration with game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our geforce platform our geforce experience gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their pc’s settings as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay we also enable interactive graphics applications  such as games movie and photo editing and design software  to be accessed by almost any device almost anywhere through our cloud platforms such as grid for enterprise and geforce now for gaming 

advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform we believe the advent of av will soon revolutionize the transportation industry in our view ai is the key technology enabler of this opportunity as the algorithms required for autonomous driving  such as perception localization and planning  are too complex for legacy handcoded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead therefore we provided a full functionally safe aibased hardware and software solution for the av market under the drive brand which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers or oems tier1 suppliers and startups our av solution also includes the gpubased hardware required to train the neural networks before their invehicle deployment as well as to resimulate their operation prior to any overtheair software updates we believe our comprehensive toptobottom and endtoend approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving 

leveraging our intellectual property we believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products or have us do so through a custom development such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology 

sales and marketing 

our sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our highperformance and efficient gpu and embedded systemonachip or soc platforms our sales and marketing teams located across our global markets work closely with end customers in each industry our partner network incorporates each industrys respective oems original device manufacturers or odms system builders addin board manufacturers or aibs retailersdistributors internet and cloud service providers automotive manufacturers and tier1 automotive suppliers mapping companies startups and other ecosystem participants 

members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge we also employ a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform 

to encourage the development of applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems 

our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of ai frameworks software development kits and application programming interfaces or apis for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms our deep learning institute provides inperson and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build ai and accelerated computing applications that leverage our gpu and cuda platforms we now have over 16 million registered developers across our platforms including accelerated computing gaming deep learning autonomous machines and others 

as nvidia’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets and from chips to platforms and complete systems so too have our avenues to market thus in addition to sales to customers in our partner network certain of our platforms are also sold through etail channels or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers 

sales to dell technologies inc or dell accounted for 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules thus we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud service provider data centers although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year in addition based on the production schedules of key customers some of our products for notebooks or game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products instead we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing additionally we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd kinsus interconnect technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from micron technology samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynix 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and configuration and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutions 

we also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd and hon hai precision industry co and odms such as quanta computer and wistron corporation to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process 

working capital 

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products a substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 47 to 1090 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared with the end of fiscal year 2019  

competition 

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and other accelerated and ai computing processor products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

our current competitors include 

 patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from march 2020 to october 2039 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 we have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

as of january 26 2020  we had 13775 employees 9823 of whom were engaged in research and development and 3952 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted 

we created gpubased visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization data center and automotive these markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments we devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and data center markets which presents additional risks to our business we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas including customer service and support we also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all if our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed 

competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue 

our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products in addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware phishing and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or 

implement adequate preventative measures these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems to defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expenses 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

 in addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available 

software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs write off the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china hong kong and korea additionally a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through hong kong geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the united states or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability in particular revisions to laws or regulations or their 

interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans for example regulations to implement the export control reform act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations 

in january 2020 a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in china resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus the impact has extended to other regions we have operations and employees in china and the region represents an important end market for our products our customers and suppliers within china and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures the coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements we sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers as a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sellthrough as we experienced with our midrange gaming gpus in fiscal year 2019 in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events in such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributors and partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels for fiscal year 2020 11 of our total revenue was from one customer dell our operating results in the foreseeable 

future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 we could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to us trade restrictions the loss of any of our large customers a significant reduction in purchases by them or our inability to sell to a customer due to us trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states we allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for 92 of total revenue for fiscal year 2020  and 87 for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018  revenue from billings to china including hong kong was 25 of our revenue for fiscal year 2020 even if our customers revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location additionally as of january 26 2020  approximately 46 of our employees were located outside of the united states the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

 if our sales outside of the united states are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we are less successful 

in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments including the mellanox acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business in march 2019 we announced our agreement to acquire mellanox for approximately 69 billion the mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives additional risks related to the mellanox acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to 

 risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from 

a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to 

 any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities further changes in united states federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja 

our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in our international organization as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings 

we currently and may in the future face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business on a global basis for example multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in addition a stockholder purporting to act on behalf of the company filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations 

in addition the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in or remedy violations of these laws and regulations 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

fiscal year 2020 summary 



revenue for fiscal year 2020 was 1092 billion down 7 from a year earlier gpu business revenue was 947 billion down 7 from a year earlier tegra processor business revenue  which includes automotive socs for gaming platforms and embedded edge ai platforms  was 145 billion down 6 from a year earlier 

from a market platform perspective gaming revenue was 552 billion down 12 from a year ago reflecting lower sales of geforce desktop gpus and socs for gaming platforms partially offset by growth in geforce notebook gpus 

professional visualization revenue was 121 billion up 7 from a year ago reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations 

data center revenue was 298 billion up 2 from a year ago driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales 

automotive revenue was 700 million up 9 from a year ago reflecting growth in ai cockpit solutions and development services agreements 

oem and other revenue was 505 million down 34 from a year ago primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrencyspecific product sales 

gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 620 up 80 basis points from a year ago primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously writtenoff components 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were 392 billion up 16 from a year ago reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation and infrastructure costs 

income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was 285 billion down 25 from a year earlier net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were 280 billion and 452 respectively both down 32 from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses 

on march 10 2019 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger or the merger agreement with mellanox technologies ltd or mellanox pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of mellanox for 125 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately 69 billion as of the date of the merger agreement the merger agreement contains customary representations warranties and covenants the consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of mellanox shareholders as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the merger agreement in june 2019 mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from mexico in july 2019 and from the european commission in december 2019 in addition the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in may 2019 discussions with chinas regulatory agency the state administration for market regulation are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020 if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals we could be obligated to pay mellanox a termination fee of 350 million  

in november 2018 we communicated our intent to return 300 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020 including 700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 in fiscal year 2020 we returned 390 million in quarterly cash dividends we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020 we intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of mellanox 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1090 billion as of january 26 2020  compared with 742 billion as of january 27 2019  the increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow 

in january 2020 a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in china resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus the impact has extended to other regions we have operations and employees in china and the region represents an important end market for our products our customers and suppliers within china and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures the coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business 

gpu business 

in gaming we extended nvidia’s family of turingbased gpus with the geforce gtx 1660 ti gtx 1660 and gtx 1650 as well as with our new super line including the geforce rtx 2080 super rtx 2070 super rtx 2060 super gtx 1660 super and gtx 1650 super and accelerated momentum of raytracing games by supporting a growing list of titles introduced new rtx studio laptops powered by geforce rtx and quadro rtx gpus for online and studiobased creatives and prosumer customers unveiled two new models of the shield tv streaming media player and introduced two new service offerings for geforce now cloud gaming service 

in professional visualization we expanded adoption of nvidia rtx raytracing technology by 3d application providers rolled out a full range of turingbased quadro gpus for mobile workstations incorporating ray tracing for product design architecture effects and scientific visualization and unveiled the nvidia omniverse opencollaboration platform to simplify creative workflows for content creation 

in data center we introduced the nvidia cudax ai platform for accelerating data science announced availability of nvidia t4 tensor core gpus from leading oems and cloud service providers unveiled the dgx superpod and announced support for arm cpus providing a new path to build aienabled exascale supercomputers as well as a collaboration with arm and others on a reference design for gpu accelerated armbased servers we launched the nvidia egx intelligent edge computing platform bringing accelerated ai to vertical industries and announced a collaboration to integrate microsoft 

azure with egx as well as plans for a scalable gpuaccelerated supercomputer in the microsoft azure cloud additionally we entered the 5g telecom market enabling telcos to build efficient virtualized 5g rans announced a collaboration to deliver softwaredefined 5g ran and announced that alibaba and baidu’s recommendation engines run on nvidia ai 

tegra processor business 

in our automotive platform we announced a partnership with toyota research instituteadvanced development to develop train and validate selfdriving vehicles unveiled the nvidia drive ap2x automated driving solution encompassing drive autopilot software drive agx and drive validation tools introduced the nvidia drive av safety force field to enable safe comfortable driving experiences and announced availability of the nvidia drive constellation autonomous vehicle simulation platform 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to inventories revenue recognition income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products or components based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019  the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess dram other components and prior architecture components and chips as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

product sales revenue 

revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers 

for products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers 

license and development arrangements 

our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components as a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 26 2020  we had a valuation allowance of 621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units 

gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 26 2020 was 210 million and 408 million  respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

we performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment 

refer to note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

revenue by reportable segments 



gpu business gpu business revenue decreased by 7 in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019  which reflects a decline in gpus sold for gaming geforce gpu product sales for gaming decreased by 10 reflecting lower sales of geforce 

desktop gpus and socs for gaming platforms partially offset by growth in geforce notebook gpus revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased by 7 reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations data center revenue which includes tesla grid and dgx increased by 2 driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue decreased by 6 in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019  this was driven by a decline in revenue from socs for gaming platforms which was partially offset by an increase of 9 in automotive revenue reflecting growth in ai cockpit solutions and development services agreements 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 92 and 87 of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019  respectively  revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

dell represented approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the gpu business no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019  

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 620 and 612 for fiscal years 2020 and 2019  respectively the increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously writtenoff components 

inventory provisions totaled 161 million and 270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 145 million and 41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

gpu business the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously writtenoff components 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019 

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 19 in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including infrastructure costs and stockbased compensation expense

investment and interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses 

as of january 26 2020  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 1 million 

in fiscal year 2017 we issued 100 billion of the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the notes due 2026 we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their 

prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollar these forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense

advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform  we believe the advent of av will soon revolutionize the transportation industry in our view ai is the key technology enabler of this opportunity as the algorithms required for autonomous driving  such as perception localization and planning  are too complex for legacy handcoded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead therefore we have provided a full functionally safe aibased hardware and software solution for the av market under the drive brand which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers or oems tier1 suppliers and startups our av solution also includes the gpubased hardware required to train the neural networks before their invehicle deployment as well as to resimulate their operation prior to any overtheair software updates we believe our comprehensive toptobottom and endtoend approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving 

leveraging our intellectual property  we believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products or have us do so through a custom development such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology 

sales and marketing 

our sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our highperformance and efficient gpu and embedded systemonachip or soc platforms our sales and marketing teams located across our global markets work closely with end customers in each industry our partner network incorporates each industrys respective oems original device manufacturers or odms system builders addin board manufacturers or aibs retailersdistributors internet and cloud service providers automotive manufacturers and tier1 automotive suppliers mapping companies startups and other ecosystem participants 

members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge we also employ a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform 

to encourage the development of applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of ai frameworks software development kits and application programming interfaces or apis for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms our deep learning institute provides inperson and online training 

for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build ai and accelerated computing applications that leverage our gpu and cuda platforms we now have over 700 thousand registered developers across our platforms including accelerated computing gaming deep learning autonomous machines and others 

as nvidia’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets and from chips to platforms and complete systems so too have our avenues to market thus in addition to sales to customers in our partner network certain of our platforms are also sold through etail channels or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules thus we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud service provider datacenters although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue for example in fiscal year 2019 second half revenue was weaker than the first half 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products instead we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing additionally we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd kinsus interconnect technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from micron technology samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynix 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and configuration and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutions 

we also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd and hon hai precision industry co and odms such as quanta computer and wistron corporation to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process 

working capital 

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 4  to 742 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2019  compared with the end of fiscal year 2018  

competition 

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and accelerated and ai computing processor products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

our current competitors include 

 patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from february 2019 to february 2038 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

as of january 27 2019  we had 13277  employees 9486  of whom were engaged in research and development and 3791  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted 

we have created gpubased visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive these markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments we currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and datacenter markets which presents additional risks to our business we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas including customer service and customer support we also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all if our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed 

competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue 

our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products in addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may 

create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems to defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expenses 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs write off the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 



 in addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the united states or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability in particular revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans for example regulations to implement the export control reform act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel our operations 

could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements we sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers as a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sellthrough as we experienced with our midrange gaming gpus in fiscal year 2019 in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events in such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states we allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for 87  of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  revenue from billings to china including hong kong was 24 of our revenue for fiscal year 2019 even if our customers revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location additionally as of january 27 2019  approximately 46 of our employees were located outside of the united states the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including 



 if our sales outside of the united states are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business the risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to 



risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to 



 any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities further changes in united states federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja 

our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in our international organization as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings 

we currently and may in the future face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business on a global basis for example multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in addition a stockholder purporting to act on behalf of the company filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations 

in addition the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or remedy violations of these regulations 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

fiscal year 2019  summary 



revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21 year over year reflecting growth in each of our market platforms  gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive gpu business revenue was 1017 billion up 25 from a year earlier tegra processor business revenue  which includes automotive soc modules for gaming platforms and embedded edge ai platforms  was 154 billion up slightly from a year ago 

gaming revenue was 625 billion up 13 from a year ago driven by growth in gaming gpus gaming gpu growth was fueled by turingbased gpus for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our maxq technology we experienced significant volatility in our gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019 we believe demand for our desktop gaming gpu products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its aftereffects have distorted trends in gaming revenue we also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions particularly in china have impacted consumer demand for our geforce gaming gpu products in addition sales of certain highend geforce gaming gpus using our new turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture as a result during a portion of fiscal year 2019 we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming gpu products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming gpu products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory for fiscal year 2020 we expect our gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019 with expected growth from sales of turingbased gpu products and notebook gpu products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previouslynoted factors 

professional visualization revenue was 113 billion up 21 from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products 

datacenter revenue was 293 billion up 52 from a year ago led by strong sales of our volta architecturebased products including nvidia tesla v100 and dgx systems toward the end of fiscal year 2019 we believe that customers across broadbased vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty and a number of 

datacenter deals did not close while we believe the pause is temporary our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the datacenter market until later in fiscal year 2020 

automotive revenue of 641 million was up 15 from a year earlier driven by infotainment modules production drive platforms and development agreements with automotive companies 

oem and ip revenue was 767 million down 1 from a year ago driven by the absence of intel licensing revenue which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 306 million and 273 million respectively we expect revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products to be negligible going forward 

gross margin for fiscal year 2019  was 612 compared with 599 a year earlier which reflects our continued shift toward highervalue platforms which more than offset the impact of approximately 128 million in charges for excess dram and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of 57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2019  were 337 billion up 29 from a year earlier reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including infrastructure costs 

income from operations for fiscal year 2019 was 380 billion up 19 from a year earlier net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2019 were 414 billion and 663 respectively up 36 and 38 respectively from a year earlier fueled primarily by revenue growth and improved gross margin as well as the impact of the us tax reform benefit 

during fiscal year 2019  we returned 195 billion to shareholders through a combination of 158 billion in share repurchases and 371 million in quarterly cash dividends we intend to return 300 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020 including 700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 742 billion as of january 27 2019  compared with 711 billion as of january 28 2018  the increase was primarily related to the increase in net income partially offset by changes in working capital and the increases in stock repurchases dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units 

gpu business 

during fiscal year 2019 for gaming we announced nvidia rtx  a computer graphics technology using our turing architecture that produces moviequality images in real time using ray tracing and ai during the year we released many new geforce rtx desktop gaming gpu products including rtx 2080ti 2080 2070 and 2060 as well as many new maxq geforce gaming notebook gpu products  the most recent of which are powered by rtx gpus

tegra processor business 

during fiscal year 2019 for the automotive market we introduced the nvidia drive autopilot level 2 automated driving system announced nvidia drive agx design wins with toyota volvo cars and isuzu motors and announced that daimler and bosch have selected nvidia’s drive platform to bring automated and driverless vehicles to city streets we also began production of our xavier singlechip autopilot soc started shipping the nvidia drive agx xavier developer kit and introduced the nvidia drive constellation server with drive sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging nvidia gpus and nvidia drive pegasus 

in addition we launched the nvidia jetson agx xavier module to help build the nextgeneration of autonomous machines and announced that yamaha motor co will use nvidia to power its upcoming lineup of autonomous machines 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

product sales revenue 

revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers 

for products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers 

license and development arrangements 

our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components as a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period 

software licensing 

our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software software licenses are frequently sold along with postcontract customer support or pcs for such arrangements we allocate revenue to the software license and pcs on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018  and 2017  the higher amount of charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess dram other components and prior architecture components and chips whereas the charges we took during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of gpu and tegra products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 27 2019  we had a valuation allowance of 562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

the tcja which was enacted in december 2017 significantly changed us tax law including a reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes global intangible lowtaxed income or gilti on certain foreignsource earnings as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019 the sec had provided guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year 

from the enactment date as of january 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tcja and elected to account for gilti in deferred taxes refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the tcja 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 27 2019  was 210 million  and 408 million  respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019  we used the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets all of our availableforsale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments 

we performed an impairment review of our debt investment portfolio as of january 27 2019  we concluded that our debt investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale debt investments as of january 27 2019  

refe r to notes 7 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units or rsus performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or psus performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased psus and our employee stock purchase plan the number of psus and marketbased psus that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year 

re fer to notes 1 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations co uld be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

revenue by reportable segments 



gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 25  in fiscal year 2019  compared to fiscal year 2018  this increase was due primarily to 18 growth in sales of geforce gpu products for gaming driven by initial sales of turingbased gpus for desktops and by highperformance notebooks based on our maxq technology datacenter revenue including tesla grid and dgx increased 52 reflecting strong sales of our volta architecture products including nvidia tesla v100 and dgx systems revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased 21 due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products our pc oem revenue decreased by 1 driven by the absence of intel licensing revenue in fiscal year 2019 revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 306 million and 273 million respectively we expect cryptocurrencyrelated revenue to be negligible going forward 

gpu business revenue increased by 40  in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017  led by growth in gaming datacenter and professional visualization revenue from sales of geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 20 reflecting continued strong demand for our pascalbased gpu products datacenter revenue including tesla grid and dgx increased 133 reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated gpu computing as well as demand for hpc dgx ai supercomputing and grid virtualization platforms revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased by 12 due primarily to higher sales in both highend desktop and mobile 

workstation products revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems increased by over 90 due primarily to strong demand for gpu products targeted for cryptocurrency mining 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019  compared to fiscal year 2018  this was driven by an increase of over 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules production drive px platforms and development agreements with automotive companies offset by a decline of approximately 15 in soc modules for gaming platforms and related development services 

tegra processor business revenue increased by 86 in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  this was driven by an increase of over 300 in revenue from soc modules for gaming platforms and development services and an increase of 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules drive px platforms and development agreements for selfdriving cars 

all other   our patent license agreement with intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for fiscal year 2018 we recognized related revenue of  43 million  down from  264 million  for fiscal year 2017 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 87  of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

no single customer represented more than 10 of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 in fiscal year 2017 we had one customer that represented 12 of our total revenue 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 612  599  and 588  for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward highervalue platforms which more than offset the impact of approximately 128 million in charges for excess dram and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of 57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips the increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix the growth of our geforce gaming gpu revenue and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization the increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

inventory provisions totaled 270 million 48 million and 62 million for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 41 million 35 million and 51 million for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018  and 2017  

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

gpu business the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2019  when compared to fiscal year 2018  primarily due to strong sales of highend geforce gaming gpus and revenue growth in datacenter including tesla grid and dgx for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2018  when compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to strong sales of our geforce gaming gpu products and revenue growth in datacenter including tesla grid and dgx for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2019  when compared to fiscal year 2018  primarily due to a favorable mix shift the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2018  when compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive

the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rates the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tcja favorable recognition of us federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended us federal statutory rate of 339 for fiscal year 2018 and 35 for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition of us federal research tax credits the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

in fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactmentdate effects of the tcja by applying the sec guidance in sab 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects furthermore under us gaap we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes because we were still evaluating the gilti provisions as of january 28 2018 we recorded no giltirelated deferred balances after further evaluation we elected to account for gilti deferred taxes as of january 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tcja and recognized a reduction of 368 million  to the provisional amount recorded at january 28 2018 primarily relating to the effects of electing to account for gilti in deferred taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses 

as of january 27 2019  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 05 would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of 8 million or an increase in fair value for these investments of 7 million  respectively 

in fiscal year 2017 we issued 100 billion of the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the notes due 2026 we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollar these forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense

as nvidia’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets and from chips to platforms and complete systems so too have our avenues to market thus in addition to sales to customers in our partner network certain of our platforms are also sold through etail channels or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and 

in manufacturing availability our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules thus we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud service provider datacenters although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products instead we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing additionally we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from micron technology samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynix 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutions 

we also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd and quanta computer to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process 

working capital 

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 5  to 711 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2018  compared with the end of fiscal year 2017  

research and development 

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading accelerated computing technology is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is focused on a unified hardware and software architecture our products take years to design and bring to market and we concurrently develop multiple generations of our architecture our research and development efforts include software engineering including efforts related to the development of our cuda platform hardware engineering related to our gpus tegra processors and systems very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms 

as of january 28 2018  we had 8191  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  we incurred research and development expenses of 180 billion  146 billion  and  133 billion  respectively 

competition 

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and accelerated and ai computing processor products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

our current competitors include 

 patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2018 to january 2037 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

as of january 28 2018  we had 11528  employees 8191  of whom were engaged in research and development and 3337  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted 

we have created gpubased visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive these markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments we currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and datacenter markets which presents additional risks to our business we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas including customer service and customer support we also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all if our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed 

competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue 

our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products in addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems to defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expenses 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs write off the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on 

independent subcontractors we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

 in addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline 

if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the us or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements 

trade policies and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events in such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 79  80 and 79 of total revenue for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively additionally as of january 28 2018 approximately 47 of our employees were located outside of the united states the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including 



 if our sales outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business the risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to 

 risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others 

regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to 



 any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities further changes in united states federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja 

our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in our international organization as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings 

we have in the past and may from time to time face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands and investigations involving shareholder consumer competition and other issues relating to our business on a global basis in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or remedy violations of these regulations litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing 

of patents an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

revenue from our patent license agreement with intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018  

gross margin for fiscal year 2018  was 599 compared with 588 a year earlier reflecting a favorable shift in mix the growth of our geforce gaming gpus and the growth of our gpu computing platform for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with intel 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2018  were 261 billion up from 213 billion in the previous year this reflects growth in employees and related costs as well as investments in growth initiatives including gaming ai and autonomous driving 

we recorded a us tax reform provisional net tax benefit of 133 million associated with the onetime transition tax on our historical foreign earnings and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor as we typically find that over 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2018  and 2017  and an unfavorable impact of 16 in fiscal year 2016  the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 28 2018  we had a valuation allowance of 469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

the tcja which was enacted in december 2017 significantly changes us tax law including a reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the tcja 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 28 2018  was 210 million  and 408 million  respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

we use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill the fair values of our gpu and tegra processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values as such even the application of a hypotheti cal 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value 

refe r to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments 

we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 28 2018  we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of january 28 2018  

refe r to notes 6 and 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units or rsus performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or psus performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased psus and our employee stock purchase plan or espp the number of psus and marketbased psus that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year 

re fer to notes 1 and 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations co uld be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such 

events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

revenue by reportable segments 



gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 40  in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  led by growth in gaming datacenter and professional visualization revenue from sales of geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 20 reflecting continued strong demand for our pascalbased gpu products datacenter revenue including tesla grid and dgx increased 133 reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated gpu computing as well as demand for hpc dgx ai supercomputing and grid virtualization platforms revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased by 12 due primarily to higher sales in both high end desktop and mobile workstation products revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems increased by over 90 due primarily to strong demand for gpu products targeted for cryptocurrency mining 

gpu business revenue increased by 39  in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016  this increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our geforce gpu gaming and datacenter platforms sales of highend geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 40 reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and strong demand for our recent pascalbased gpu products datacenter revenue including our tesla nvidia grid and dgx1 brands increased by 145 reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for ai cloud accelerated and virtualized 

computing and initial dgx1 sales revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased 11 due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to fiscal year 2016 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue increased by 86  in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  this was driven by an increase of over 300 in revenue from soc modules for gaming platforms and development services and an increase of 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules drive px platforms and development agreements for selfdriving cars 

tegra processor business revenue increased by 47 in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  this was driven by an increase of over 50 in sales of tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50 in gaming development platforms and services compared to fiscal year 2016 

all other   our patent license agreement with intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for fiscal year 2018 we recognized related revenue of 43 million  down from 264 million  for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 79  80  and 79  of total revenue for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

no single customer represented more than 10 of total revenue for fiscal year 2018 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we had one customer that represented 12 and 11 of our total revenue respectively 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 599  588  and 561  for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively these increases were driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix the growth of our geforce gaming gpu revenue and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization the increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 48 million 62 million and 112 million for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 35 million 51 million and 32 million for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  and an unfavorable impact of 16 for fiscal year 2016  

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

gpu business the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2018  when compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to strong sales of our geforce gaming gpu products and revenue growth in datacenter including tesla grid and dgx for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2017  when compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our gaming datacenter and professional visualization gpu products as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin pc oem products 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2018  when compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2017  when compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to fewer inventory provisions and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the shield tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016  

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 23  in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  and increased 10  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 23  in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  and increased by 10  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of 11 million in fiscal year 2018 and 57 million in fiscal year 2017 resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with samsung and qualcomm 

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal year 2016 we began to wind down our icera modem operations as a result our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million of restructuring and other charges 

total other income expense   

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income was 69 million  54 million  and 39 million  in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment 

interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 220 notes due 2021 and 320 notes due 2026 issued in september 2016 and the convertible notes issued in december 2013 interest expense was 61 million  58 million  and 47 million  in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  

other net 

other net consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies losses on early conversions of the convertible notes and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates net other expense was 22 million and 25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016 the net other expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the convertible notes 

income taxes 

the tcja which was enacted in december 2017 significantly changes us tax law including a reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 

the corporate tax reduction is effective as of january 1 2018 since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year we are subject to transitional tax rules as a result our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 339 the change in the statutory tax rate from 35 to 339 for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate 

we recognized income tax expense of 149 million 239 million and 129 million for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our annual effective tax rate was 47 125 and 173 for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended us federal statutory rate of 339 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition of the us federal research tax credit the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than us federal statutory tax rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations and adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2017 

for fiscal year 2018 we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the tcja which were included as components of income tax expense and reflected in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 we will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and our consolidated financial statements the final impact of the tcja recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to a number of uncertainties and factors including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by us federal and state tax authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting 

in addition to the impact on fiscal year 2018 the tcja also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019 while each of these new tax laws is expected to have some impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2019 and future periods we expect the provision designed to tax the lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant impact 

because of the complexity of the new tax laws on the lowtaxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tcja and the application of related accounting standards based on recent deliberations of the financial accounting standards board or fasb we expect to be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future taxable income in the us as a currentperiod expense when incurred or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes our selection of an accounting policy will depend in part on our analysis of relevant facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each method

liquidity and capital resources 





as of january 28 2018  we had 711 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 310 million  from the end of fiscal year 2017  our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions our portfolio managers are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset types and certain limits on our portfolio duration 

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital 

cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable securities partially offset by the purchase of our previouslyfinanced santa clara campus building cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017 increased from fiscal year 2016  primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 

cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of 200 billion of notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of convertible notes tax payments related to employee stock plans share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018 cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2017  increased from fiscal year 2016  primarily due to the 200 billion of notes issued in september 2016 partially offset by the repayments of convertible notes and 100 billion of capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses 

as of january 28 2018  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 14 million  

in fiscal year 2017 we issued 100 billion of the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the notes due 2026 in fiscal year 2014 we issued 150 billion  of convertible notes which had 15 million  in principal amount outstanding as of january 28 2018  we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of the convertible notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other 

currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollar these forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules thus we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing   

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynix 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutions 

we also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd auto co ltd and quanta computer to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process 

working capital 

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 35  to 680 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2017  compared with the end of fiscal year 2016  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other embedded products using independent design teams our research and development efforts include software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with industry leaders we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of visual computing and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products 

as of january 29 2017  we had 7282  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we incurred research and development expenses of 146 billion  133 billion  and  136 billion  respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and accelerated and ai computing processor products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from march 2017 to november 2035 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

• the location in which our products are manufactured 

• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries 

• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions and 

• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions 

we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

  

as of january 29 2017  we had 10299  employees 7282  of whom were engaged in research and development and 3017  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets identify new products services or technologies or successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted 

nvidiabranded solutions and services are visual computing and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to meet the evolving needs of these markets and to enhance our existing products services and technologies in addition our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry trends and to develop new products services and technologies our existing markets and products and new markets and products may require a considerable investment of technical financial compliance sales and marketing resources we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive such as the automotive market 

we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed in addition if demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations if we fail to achieve consumer or market acceptance of them or if we are not able to develop these products and services in a cost effective or efficient manner we may not realize benefits from our strategy 

our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets or introduce new offerings in light of the competitive environment our results of operations could suffer 

if our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships and our financial results 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

if we do not replace our intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected 

in january 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years the final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in january 2016 we will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 if we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline 

if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design wins we must 

• anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand 

 • price our products competitively 

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network with several of these partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels as a result revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 12 11 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2017 2016  and 2015  respectively our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

• changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy 

• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market 

• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products 

• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements 

• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products 

• less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or 

• increased competition including competitive pricing actions 

in addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 80  79  and 75  of total revenue for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear programs for the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include 

 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with development and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangement 

in fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in santa clara california which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project we may also encounter unanticipated delays in the construction of the new building and final city approval for occupancy may be delayed we are financing this construction under an operating lease arrangement described below delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operating lease financing arrangement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our headquarters we have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquarters building in order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement we will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing such agreements including compliance with financial and other covenants certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control if we fail to comply with the covenants we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement further noncompliance with such covenants or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property and the lenders could have the right to among other things foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement a loss of financing for the new headquarters building or foreclosure on the collateral could adversely affect our liquidity and business 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations 

in september 2016 we issued 100 billion of 220 notes due september 16 2021 or the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of 320 notes due september 16 2026 or the notes due 2026 collectively the notes in december 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due december 1 2018 or the convertible notes of which 827 million in principal amount remained outstanding as of january 29 2017 we have received additional conversion requests of 660 million  in principal amount 502 million  of which have already settled 103 million of which are expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 55 million of which are expected to settle during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 

our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes additionally our obligation to make payments related to the notes or the convertible notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes 

the warrants associated with our convertible notes or the warrants dilute our net income per share and the settlement or eventual exercise of the warrants would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders 

when the average trading price of our common stock for a fiscal quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of the warrants the number of diluted weighted average shares used in our net income per share calculation increases which dilutes our net income per share 

any issuance by us of shares upon exercise or any other settlement of the warrants may dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders in december 2016 we entered into an agreement with a counterparty bank to terminate 63 million of the 75 million warrants outstanding in consideration for the termination of these warrants we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank the amount of which was determined each day based on the daily volumeweighted average price of our common stock during an observation period beginning december 13 2016 and ending january 31 2017 as of january 29 2017 44 million of the 48 million shares of our common stock had been issued related to the terminated warrants the remaining 4 million shares were issued in the beginning of fiscal year 2018 

an aggregate of 12 million warrants remained outstanding or the remaining warrants as of january 29 2017 the remaining warrants will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless the warrant holder notifies us otherwise 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

• the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval 

• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent 

• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals 

• the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval 

• a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and 

• the ability of our board of directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

fiscal year 2017  summary 



revenue for fiscal year 2017  grew 38 to 691 billion reflecting growth in each of our market platforms  gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive gpu business revenue was 582 billion up 39 from a year earlier led by growth in our geforce gpu gaming and datacenter platforms geforce gpu gaming growth was fueled by strong adoption of our latest pascal architecture datacenter growth reflected strong demand for deep learning training cloud and virtualized computing and sales of our new dgx1 supercomputer tegra business revenue was 824 million up 47 from a year ago led by growth in automotive primarily from infotainment modules and gaming development platforms and services 

gross margin for fiscal year 2017  was 588 compared with 561 a year earlier reflecting the growth of geforce gaming gpus the growth of our gpu computing platforms for cloud deep learning ai and graphics virtualization and decreased sales volumes of lower margin products 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2017  were 213 billion up from 206 billion in the previous year this reflects growth in headcount and related costs partially offset by lower litigation and restructuring expenses 

net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2017  were 167 billion and 257 respectively up 171 and 138 respectively from a year earlier these increases were fueled by strong revenue growth improved gross and operating margins and a lower effective income tax rate as a result of a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to united states tax and the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting 

we returned 100 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017  through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends and we intend to return approximately 125 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 

for sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such cases the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cemsodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

please refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 02 16 and 06 in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

united states income tax has not been provided for a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 29 2017  we had a valuation allowance of 353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 29 2017  was 210 million  and 408 million  respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business 

when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill the fair values of our gpu and tegra processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values as such even the application of a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments 

we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 29 2017  we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of january 29 2017  

please refer to notes 6 and 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units or rsus performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or psus performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased psus our employee stock purchase plan or espp and stock options in fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting rsus psus and marketbased psus to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies the number of psus and marketbased psus that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year 

please refer to notes 1 and 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

nvidia’s products and services are built for three computing platforms  pc datacentercloud and mobile for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 72 77 and 75 of our revenue respectively was associated with the pc computing platform of which gpus for the gaming and professional visualization markets comprised approximately 92 88 and 80 respectively while pc oem represented approximately 8 12 and 20 respectively 

revenue by reportable segments 



gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 39  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  this increase was due primarily to increased revenue from our geforce gpu gaming and datacenter platforms sales of highend geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 40 reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and strong demand for our recent pascalbased gpu products datacenter revenue including our tesla nvidia grid and dgx1 brands increased 145 reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for ai cloud accelerated and virtualized computing and initial dgx1 sales revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased 11 due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to last year 

gpu business revenue increased by 9  in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015  this increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of highend geforce gpu products for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and increased sales of our maxwellbased gpu products revenue from tesla gpus for datacenter increased driven by strong demand from hyperscale companies for deep learning for ai and accelerated computing revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to the prior year 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue increased by 47  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  this was driven by an increase of over 50 in sales of tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50 in gaming development platforms compared to last year 

tegra processor business revenue decreased by 3 in fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  this decrease was driven by a decline in sales of tegra products for oem smartphones and tablets of almost 90 partially offset by an increase in sales of tegra products serving automotive systems of almost 75 revenue also grew from development services and sales of shield devices 

all other license revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 was flat at 264 million  for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  the remaining 44 million in revenue under this arrangement will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 80  79  and 75  of total revenue for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

our overall gross margin was 588  561  and 555  for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these increases were driven primarily by a higher mix of our gpu business fewer inventory provisions and lower warranty charges in our tegra processor business 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 62 million 112 million and 59 million for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 09 22 and 13 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 51 million for fiscal year 2017  and 32 million for both fiscal years 2016  and 2015  favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 06 and 07 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 02 16 and 06 in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2017  when compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our geforce gaming tesla grid and quadro gpu products as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin pc oem products the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2016  when compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily due to strong sales of our high end geforce gaming gpu products and the decreased sales volume of lower margin pc oem products 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2017  when compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to fewer inventory provisions and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the shield tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016  the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016  when compared to fiscal year 2015  due to inventory provisions a warranty charge associated with the shield tablet product recall and higher automotive and shield product sales which have had comparably lower gross margins the inventory provisions related primarily to older generation tegra products as well as inventory purchase commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for shield products 

operating expenses 



  

research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 10  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expenses decreased by 2  in fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  this decrease was primarily driven by the winddown of icera modem operations and other organization efficiencies partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation expense 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 10  in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense offsetting these increases was a 57 million decrease in outside professional fees resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with samsung and qualcomm during early fiscal year 2017  

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 25  in fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  outside professional fees increased primarily due to 70 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against samsung and qualcomm compensation and benefits increased by 39 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense advertising and promotions increased by 9 million resulting from digital advertising 

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal year 2016 we began the wind down our icera modem operations as a result our operating expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 included 3 million and 131 million respectively of restructuring and other charges please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in december 2013 and the notes we issued in september 2016 

interest income was 54 million  39 million  and 28 million  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these increases in interest income were primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities as well as higher purchased yields 

interest expense was 58 million  47 million  and 46 million  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  the increase in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to interest expense related to the notes we issued in september 2016 partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the early conversion of a significant portion of the convertible notes during fiscal year 2017  

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies losses on early conversions of the convertible notes and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates 

net other income expense was  25 million   4 million  and  14 million  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the net other expense in fiscal year 2017  compared to the net other income in fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to 21 million of losses we recognized from early conversions of the convertible notes the decrease for fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of nonaffiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement 

   

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of 239 million 129 million and 124 million for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our annual effective tax rate was 125 173 and 165 for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was due to an additional amount of earnings subject to united states tax in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016 

our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations and adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2017

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 29 2017  and january 31 2016  we had 680 billion  and 504 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of january 29 2017  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities 

as of january 29 2017  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 33 million  

investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may be negatively impacted due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary 

other income expense net could also vary depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and foreign exchange fluctuations volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 29 2017  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 40  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 27  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa3 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2  5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 73 million   184 million  

in december 2013 we issued 150 billion  of convertible notes in september 2016 we issued 100 billion of the notes due 2021 and 100 billion of the notes due 2026 in october 2016 we also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow repay and reborrow amounts from time to time up to 575 million please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of the notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

we are financing the construction of our new headquarters building under an offbalance sheet buildtosuit operating lease financing arrangement following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest that is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement in fiscal year 2016 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates please refer to notes 9 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information if the syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement were to fail to fund loans for any reason we would remain liable for payments due under the swap unless we were to settle the swap if we were to settle the swap at a time when interest rates have fallen relative to the swap’s inception the price to settle the swap could be significant 

foreign exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated statements of income and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

  

during fiscal year 2017 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur 

during fiscal year 2017 we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense net

beyond automotive we see the opportunity for tegra in other embedded areas where visual computing is valued examples include robots that respond to voice and gesture commands drones that process enormous amounts of visualbased data and smart monitors powered by android that make a pc optional 

business strategies 

nvidia’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include 

extending our technology leadership in visual computing  we believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing we apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications 

extending our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloudcomputing platforms we believe that visual computing will remain a key component in the computing paradigm circumscribed by mobile cloud and software as a service we enable interactive graphics applications  such as games movie and photo editing and design software  to be accessed by any device anywhere we believe that the user experience in virtual desktop infrastructures should be indistinguishable from physical environments and accordingly leverage our research and development resources to create differentiated devices and products that deliver this capability 

revolutionizing computing with the gpu’s parallel processing capability   we believe that the massively parallel processing capabilities of nvidia gpus can solve complex computational problems in significantly less time and with less power consumption than a cpu we work with developers worldwide who write programs for the cuda platform using various highlevel programming languages developers are able to accelerate applications in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis and bigdata analytics 

protecting our intellectual property and using it to enter into license and development contracts  we believe our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset that can be monetized by licensing our technology to customers and partners that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology 

enabling visual computing platforms in key focus areas we believe that we are wellpositioned to use our expertise in visual and parallel computing to make contributions in four key markets where our visual computing expertise is valued 

 gaming   our strategy is to use advanced graphics technologies to create a range of gaming platforms stretching across pcs mobile devices and the cloud 

 professional visualization  our strategy is to serve as our customers most trusted graphics partner working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for nvidia gpus 

 datacenter   our strategy is to serve growing demand for deep learning bigdata analytics and scientific computing 

 automotive  our strategy is to utilize tegra’s visual computing capabilities to augment the driving experience as well as leverage our significant supercomputing capabilities to accelerate autonomous driving 

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile soc products our sales and marketing teams located across our global markets work closely with each industrys respective original equipment manufacturers or oems original device manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs retailersdistributors and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage our customers and partners to use the next generation of our products 

as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue sales to asustek computer inc accounted for 11  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2016 

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products 

as nvidia’s business has evolved from gaming to broader areas and from chips to platforms so too have our avenues to market shield products such as our gaming tablet and android tv device are sold through etail channels and through some of the world’s largest retailers 

backlog   

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing   

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

working capital 

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 9  to 504 billion  at the end of fiscal year 2016 compared with the end of fiscal year 2015 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital expenditure and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts include software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with industry leaders we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of visual computing and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products 

  

as of january 31 2016  we had 6566  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2016  2015 and 2014 we incurred research and development expense of 133 billion  136 billion  and  134 billion  respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2016 to december 2034 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

• the location in which our products are manufactured 

• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries 

• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions and 

• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions 

we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

  

as of january 31 2016  we had 9227  employees 6566  of whom were engaged in research and development and 2661  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are available free of charge on or through our web site httpwwwnvidiacom  as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission or the sec our web site and the information on it or connected to it are not a part of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted  

nvidiabranded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive our products services and technologies are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets however these markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products services and technologies and enhancements to our existing products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of them 

if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer in addition if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends our business will be harmed 

our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business 

if we fail to successfully execute our transitions to new business models and markets our results of operations could suffer 

in connection with our diversification into new business models we have transformed into a specialized platform company targeting markets where visual computing is essential and valued our business strategy is dependent on creating products and services that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends we cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners we also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive such as the automotive market these new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical financial compliance sales and marketing resources if demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations or if we are not able to improve the cost or operational efficiencies of these new business models we may not realize benefits from our strategy alternatively we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges if we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment our results of operations could suffer 

if we do not replace our intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected 

in january 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years the final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in january 2016 we will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 if we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected 

if our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customers and partners may be harmed 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships our reputation and our financial results 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems 

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline 

if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design wins we must 

• anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand 

 • price our products competitively 

unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 11 of our total revenue from one  customer in both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all to purchase fewer products than they did in the past or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted in addition gross margins for our tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins if tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins our overall gross margins may decline 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

• changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy 

• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market 

• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products 

• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements 

• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products 

• less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or 

• increased competition including competitive pricing actions 

in addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 79  of total revenue for fiscal year 2016 and 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past acquired and invested in and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products 

we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include 

 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services 

our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 

worldwide regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined complying with these changing laws could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with development and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangement 

in fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in santa clara california which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project we may also encounter unanticipated delays in the construction of the new building and final city approval for occupancy may be delayed we are financing this construction under an operating lease arrangement described below delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operating lease financing arrangement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our headquarters we have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquarters building in order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement we will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing such agreements including compliance with financial and other covenants certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control if we fail to comply with the covenants we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement further noncompliance with such covenants or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property and the lenders could have the right to among other things foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement a loss of financing for the new headquarters building or foreclosure on the collateral could adversely affect our liquidity and business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations  

in december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2018 or 100 notes our substantial indebtedness may 

 

additionally our obligation to make payments related to the 100 notes when converted or due could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes 

the exercise of warrants associated with our 100 notes would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders 

the warrants issued concurrently with our 100 notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless the warrant holder notifies us otherwise any issuance by us of shares upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders any sales in the public market by the warrant holder of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

• the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval 

• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent 

• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals 

• the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval 

• a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and 

• the ability of our board of directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

fiscal year 2016 summary 



revenue grew 7 in fiscal year 2016 to a record 501 billion gpu revenue was 419 billion up 9 from the previous year reflecting growth in geforce gpus for gaming and tesla products for datacenter tegra processor revenue was 559 million down 3 from the previous year reflecting a decline in tegra products for oems partially offset by an increase in tegra products for automotive and development services license revenue from our patent license agreement with intel remained flat at 264 million for fiscal year 2016 

gross margin for fiscal year 2016 was a record 561 up 60 basis points from the previous year led by the strength in gpu business revenue partially offset by lower tegra processor business gross margins 

operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 were 206 billion up from 184 billion in the previous year income from operations for fiscal year 2016 was 747 million down from 759 million in the previous year however these amounts for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million in restructuring and other charges for the winddown of our icera modem operations and 70 million in legal fees associated with our litigation against samsung and qualcomm 

  

net income for fiscal year 2016 was 614 million and net income per diluted share was 108 down from 631 million and 112 respectively in the previous year these decreases were driven by our legal fees and our restructuring and other charges partially offset by revenue and gross margin growth 

we returned 800 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends and we intend to return approximately 100 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 504 billion as of january 31 2016 up from 462 billion as of january 25 2015 and cash flow from operating activities was 118 billion for fiscal year 2016 up from 906 million in the previous year 

gpu business 

during fiscal year 2016 we released many new products including the geforce gtx titan x geforce gtx 980 ti geforce gtx 980 for notebook and the geforce gtx 950 these gpus deliver better performance and power efficiency than their predecessors and helped double the number of users of our geforce experience pc gaming platform from a year earlier additionally we released nvidia gameworks vr a software development kit that creates more immersive gameplay on virtual realityready desktops and notebooks and enables professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications we also announced the geforce gtx vr ready program to help users discover systems that will provide optimized virtual reality experiences 

  

we introduced the quadro m6000 a powerful professional gpu and the quadro visual computing appliance which contains eight m6000 gpus we also rolled out nvidia iray plugins for autodesk maya and autodesk 3ds max which enable users to create designs incorporating realworld lights and materials faster and easier than before and enabled professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications with the launch of nvidia designworks vr 

we announced our nextgeneration pascal gpu architecture this architecture is expected to accelerate deep learning applications faster than our currentgeneration maxwell processors in addition we unveiled our next generation virtualized graphics platform  nvidia grid 20 which delivers graphicsintensive applications to connected devices we also shipped cudnn 30 which improves performance of deep learning training on gpus 

further we announced that the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology was the first major national weather service to use a gpuaccelerated supercomputer to improve daily forecasts we introduced an endtoend hyperscale datacenter deep learning platform  consisting of two accelerators the nvidia tesla m40 and nvidia tesla m4  that lets webservices companies accelerate deep learning workloads in addition we announced that leading webservices companies were increasingly adopting our accelerated service platform to power the machine learning and high performance computing applications 

tegra processor business 

for the automotive market we are partnering with several companies to use our nvidia drive px platform  a car computer that utilizes deep learning to enable selfdriving capabilities  in their autonomous driving efforts we launched nvidia drive™ px 2 a powerful engine for invehicle artificial intelligence and announced that volvo will use drive px 2 in their autonomouscar pilot program next year we were featured in new production vehicles and concept cars with nvidiapowered digital cockpits including mercedesbenz audi porsche bentley and honda at the international auto show in frankfurt germany and also furthered our relationship with tesla motors which introduced the model x equipped with an nvidiapowered infotainment system and digital instrument cluster 

during fiscal year 2016 we launched the nvidia shield android tv device and geforce now which allows players to stream video games from the cloud to their shield devices 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 

for sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such cases the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cemsodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue 

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

please refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals 

the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 16 06 and 01 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

united states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 31 2016 we had a valuation allowance of 272 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of january 31 2016 was 210 million  and 408 million  respectively determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business 

when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill the fair values of our gpu and tegra processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values as such even the application of a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units 

our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased 

we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availableforsale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we did not have any investments classified as level 3 as of january 31 2016  

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments 

if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 31 2016 we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of january 31 2016 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or rsus performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or psus performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased psus and our employee stock purchase plan or espp 

beginning in fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting rsus psus and marketbased psus to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies the number of psus that will ultimately vest is contingent on the company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year the number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting ranges from 0 to 200 of the target amount 

we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of rsus and psus and we use a monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of marketbased psus we use a blackscholes valuation at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year to estimate the fair value of the shares to be issued under our espp 

stockbased compensation expense for rsus and marketbased psus is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus and espp is recognized using an accelerated amortization model 

our rsu psu and marketbased psu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus psus and marketbased psus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates if factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 

nvidia’s products and services are built for three computing platforms  pc datacentercloud and mobile for each of fiscal year 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately 75 of our revenue stemmed from products and services associated with the pc computing platform of which gpus for the gaming and professional visualization markets comprised approximately 85 80 and 70 respectively while pc oem represented approximately 15 20 and 30 respectively 

revenue by reportable segments 



gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 9  in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 this increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of highend geforce gpu products for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and increased sales of our maxwellbased gpu products revenue from tesla gpus for datacenter increased driven by strong demand from cloud service providers revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to last year 

gpu business revenue increased by 11  in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 this increase was due primarily to higher revenue from geforce gpu products and associated memory for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and increased sales of our maxwellbased gpu products revenue from tesla for datacenter computing increased due to large project wins with cloud service providers and revenue from our nvidia grid virtualization products also increased as this platform gained momentum revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to fiscal year 2014 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue decreased by 3  in fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  this decrease was driven by a decline in sales of tegra products for oem smartphones and tablets of almost 90 partially offset by an increase in sales of tegra products serving automotive systems of almost 75 revenue also grew from development services and sales of shield devices 

tegra processor business revenue increased by 45 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 this increase was driven by higher sales of tegra products serving automotive infotainment systems oem smartphones and tablet devices and the onset of shield tablet sales in fiscal year 2015 

all other license revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 was flat at 264 million  for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 the final payment under this arrangement was received in january 2016 and will be recognized as revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 79 of total revenue for fiscal year 2016 and 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue 

our overall gross margin was 561  555  and 549  for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase over these fiscal years was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our gpu business partially offset by lower tegra business margins 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 112 million 59 million and 50 million for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 22 13 and 12 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 32 million for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and 43 million for fiscal year 2014 favorably impacting our gross margin by 06 07 and 11 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 16 06 and 01 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a richer product mix resulting from stronger sales of our geforce gpu products for gaming and lower sales of geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 due to richer product mix resulting from strong sales of highend geforce gtx gpu products based on our maxwell architecture and the volume increase in our tesla accelerated computing products 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 due to inventory provisions the warranty charge associated with the shield 8inch tablet product recall and a less rich product mix resulting from higher automotive and shield product sales and lower sales of oem smartphone and tablet products the inventory provisions related primarily to older generation tegra products as well as inventory purchase commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for shield products the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 these decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline in margins of our tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products which have had higher gross margins and smartphone and automotive module products which have had comparably lower gross margins 

operating expenses 



  

research and development 

research and development expenses decreased by 2 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 this decrease was primarily driven by the winddown of icera modem operations and other organization efficiencies partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 compensation and benefits increased by 57 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense offsetting this increase was a 39 million decrease in engineering development expenses 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 25  in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 outside professional fees increased primarily due to 70 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against samsung and qualcomm compensation and benefits increased by 39 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense advertising and promotions increased by 9 million resulting from higher print and digital advertising 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 10  in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 compensation and benefits increased by 54 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense facilities costs increased by 10 million as we expanded our offices internationally and leased an office building within the boundaries of our main santa clara campus offsetting these increases were a decrease in outside professional fees of 9 million as well as more favorable international taxes and government subsidies 

restructuring and other charges 

in may 2015 we announced our intent to wind down our icera modem operations and that we were open to a sale of the technology or operations we pursued the sale of icera’s technology and operations but were unable to identify a viable buyer with genuine interest as a result we began the winddown of icera modem operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 the winddown of icera modem operations allows for continued investment in strategic growth areas including our growth initiatives of deep learning selfdriving cars and gaming 

our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million  of restructuring and other charges as follows 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges to operating expense of approximately 1 million to 2 million per quarter for each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2017 after which we expect the restructuring to be substantially complete please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 

interest income was 39 million  28 million  and 17 million  in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities as well as higher purchased yields the increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 in interest bearing securities 

interest expense was 47 million  46 million  and 10 million  in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increases in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 compared to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

other income and expense 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates 

net other income was  4 million   14 million  and  7 million  in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of nonaffiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement the increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a nonaffiliated investment and losses from foreign currency remeasurement 

   

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of 129 million 124 million and 70 million during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our annual effective tax rate was 173 165 and 138 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to united states tax in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 

our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit and favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to changes in working capital and higher noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation and restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2016 partially offset by a decline in net income cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses partially offset by an increase in inventories resulting from the introduction of newly launched maxwellbased gpus and certain tegra socs and shield devices and an increase in accounts receivable 

cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 decreased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets 

cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends cash was provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to net proceeds of 148 billion from the convertible note offering we completed partially offset by net proceeds of 108 million from the related note hedge and warrant transactions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 31 2016  and january 25 2015  we had 504 billion  and 462 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of january 31 2016  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities 

as of january 31 2016  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 28 million  

investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary 

other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 31 2016  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 47  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 23  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa3 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2  5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 66 million   164 million  

on december 2 2013 we issued 150 billion  of 100  convertible senior notes due 2018 or the notes please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of the notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

during fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in santa clara california which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we are financing this construction under an offbalance sheet buildtosuit operating lease financing arrangement following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest that is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement in august 2015 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates please refer to notes 9 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information if the syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement were to fail to fund loans for any reason we would remain liable for payments due under the swap unless we were to settle the swap if we were to settle the swap at a time when interest rates have fallen relative to the swap’s inception the price to settle the swap could be significant 

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income was not significant for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and was a gain of 5  million for fiscal year 2014 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

  

 we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding as of january 31 2016

beyond automotive we see the opportunity for tegra in other embedded areas where visual computing is valued examples include robots that respond to voice and gesture commands drones that process enormous amounts of visualbased data and smart monitors powered by android that make a pc optional 

business strategies 

nvidia’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include 

extending our technology leadership in visual computing  we believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing we apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications 

extending our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloudcomputing platforms we believe that visual computing will remain a key component in the computing paradigm circumscribed by mobile cloud and software as a service we enable interactive graphics applications  such as games movie and photo editing and design software  to be accessed by any device anywhere we believe that the user experience in virtual desktop infrastructures should be indistinguishable from physical environments and accordingly leverage our research and development resources to create differentiated devices and products that deliver this capability 

revolutionizing computing with the gpu’s parallel processing capability   we believe that the massively parallel processing capabilities of nvidia gpus can solve complex computational problems in significantly less time and with less power consumption than a cpu we work with developers worldwide who write programs for the cuda platform using various highlevel programming languages developers are able to accelerate applications in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis and bigdata analytics 

protecting our intellectual property and using it to enter into license and development contracts  we believe our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset that can be monetized by licensing our technology to customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology 

enabling visual computing platforms in key focus areas we believe that we are well positioned to use our expertise in visual and parallel computing to make contributions in four key markets where our visual computing expertise is valued 

 gaming   our strategy is to use advanced graphics technologies to create a range of gaming platforms stretching across pcs mobile devices and the cloud 

 enterprise  our strategy is to serve as our customers most trusted graphics partner working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for nvidia gpus 

 hpc  cloud   our strategy is to serve growing demand for deep learning bigdata analytics and scientific computing 

 automotive  our strategy is to utilize tegra’s visual computing capabilities and extreme efficiency as well as our significant computing software assets to augment the driving experience 

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective of providing markets with our highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile soc products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs retailersdistributors and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 11  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2015 

additionally to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog   

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

manufacturing   

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

working capital 

  

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

our existing cash and marketable securities balances decreased by 10 to 462 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared with the end of fiscal year 2014 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers we believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products 

  

as of january 25 2015  we had 6658  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2015  2014 and 2013 we incurred research and development expense of  136 billion  134 billion  and  115 billion  respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share  

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2015 to december 2034 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

  

as of january 25 2015  we had 9228  employees 6658  of whom were engaged in research and development and 2570  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted  

nvidiabranded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets gaming enterprise high performance computing  cloud and automotive our gpus and tegra processors are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets however these markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products services and technologies and enhancements to our existing products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our products services and technologies 

if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer in addition if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends our business will be harmed 

our competitors’ products services and technologies may be less costly or their products services and technologies may offer superior functionality or different features than ours in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business 

if we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed 

for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design wins we must 

 

in general we are limited in our ability to introduce new products and enhancements to our customers design cycles and we must maintain compliance with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 

if our intellectual property licensing strategy is not successful our licensing revenues may decline 

we intend to license our gpu cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers who offer products in markets such as mobile the extent of the demand to license our gpu cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio is unknown and may be limited in addition we may not be able to renew our existing license agreements in january 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years the final 2000 million payment under this agreement is scheduled to be received in january 2016 and recognized as revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 if we are unable to enter into new licensing agreements or renew our existing agreements and these agreements are not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected 

if our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business 

system security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation 

security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems 

  

actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us our partners our customers third parties or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including 

 

we also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner we utilize sophisticated and technologically advanced software development tools to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline 

if our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customers may be harmed 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

  

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and increase our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2015 21  of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and 13  of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2013 the percentage of revenue we receive from our largest customers has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted in addition gross margins for our tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins if tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins our overall gross margins may decline 

if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 

we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a customer’s product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 

in addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and 74 of total revenue for fiscal year 2013 the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have in the past and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

        

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing so 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 

we have in the past and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation for example in september 2014 we filed complaints against qualcomm inc and various samsung entities with both the itc and the united states district court for the district of delaware for infringement of seven patents relating to graphics processing in november 2014 various samsung entities filed a complaint against us and velocity micro for alleged infringement of samsung’s patents if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 

factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include 

 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations  

in december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2018 or 100 notes our substantial indebtedness may 

 

the exercise of warrants issued to goldman sachs  co concurrently with our 100 notes would and the conversion of our 100 notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders  

the warrants issued concurrently with our 100 notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless goldman sachs  co notifies us otherwise any issuance by us of additional shares to goldman sachs  co upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders in addition the conversion of our 100 notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 100 notes any sales in the public market by goldman sachs  co of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 100 notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

dividend policy   

on november 8 2012 we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program the initial quarterly dividend was 0075 per share or 030 per share on an annual basis which was subsequently increased on november 7 2013 by 13 to a quarterly dividend of 0085 per share or 034 per share on an annual basis in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we paid 1865 million  and 1813 million  respectively in cash dividends to our common shareholders 

our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board of directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends in fiscal year 2015 based upon our earnings and profits 50 of our dividend payments were considered qualified dividends and 50 of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes it is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in fiscal year 2016 may be considered a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

beginning august 2004 our board of directors authorized us subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock most recently in november 2013 the board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through january 2016 and authorized an additional 100 billion  for an aggregate of 370 billion  under the repurchase program through january 25 2015 we have repurchased an aggregate of 2056 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of 32652 million as of january 25 2015 we are authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to 4348 million through january 2016 in november 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately 6000 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends 

the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured share repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

the following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the three months ended january 25 2015 in millions except per share amounts

please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 

for sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such cases the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cemsodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately 05 of total revenue 

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

please refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions 

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 594 million 501 million and 899 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 13 12 and 21 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 324 million 434 million and 537 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 11 and 13 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 06 01 and 08 in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of gpu and tegra processor products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

united states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 25 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 2610 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of january 25 2015 was 2097 million  and 4085 million  respectively determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business 

when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill the fair value of our gpu reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value and the fair value of our tegra processor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 21 as such even if we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting units being less than their carrying values as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units 

in particular the fair value of our tegra reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 21 the fair value of this reporting unit was assessed using a combination of income and market approaches the underlying assumptions we used in assessing the fair value of the tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumptions around future revenue growth rates gross margins operating expense investment levels overall market growth rates our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rates to apply to future cash flows if the actual future results of the tegra reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing its fair value the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could decline a future decline in the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could result a charge to our earnings as a result of a writedown of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit 

our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased 

we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availableforsale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we did not have any investments classified as level 3 as of january 25 2015  

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments 

if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 25 2015 we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of january 25 2015 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or rsus performance stock units or psus and our employee stock purchase plan or espp 

during fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting rsus and psus to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies the number of psus that will ultimately vest is contingent on the company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year the number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting ranges from 0 to 200 of the target amount 

we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of rsus and psus the compensation expense for rsus is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our espp using the blackscholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stockbased compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model 

our rsu and psu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus and psus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates if factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 



revenue 



revenue was 468 billion  413 billion  and 428 billion for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the all other category is as follows 

gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 11  in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 this increase was due primarily to higher revenue from geforce gtx gpus and associated memory for gaming reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and increased sales of our maxwellbased gpu products revenue from tesla for accelerated datacenter computing increased due to large project wins with cloud service providers and revenue from our nvidia grid virtualization products also increased as this platform gained momentum revenue from gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to last year 

gpu business revenue increased by 7  in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 this increase was largely attributable to strength in our highend geforce gtx gpus driven by gaming market segment demand the gpu business also benefited from higher sales of tesla accelerated datacenter computing and quadro enterprise products in fiscal year 2014 offsetting these growth areas were declines in the overall market for mainstream desktop pcs and notebooks which contributed to lower unit volumes of our mainstream geforce gpus 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue increased by 45  in fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was driven by higher sales of tegra products serving automotive infotainment systems smartphones and tablet devices and the onset of shield tablet sales in fiscal year 2015 

tegra processor business revenue decreased by 48  in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our previous generation tegra 3based products for smartphones and tablet devices additionally sales of our embedded products for entertainment devices and revenue from license fees related to game consoles also decreased during fiscal year 2014 these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of tegra 4based products for smartphones and tablet devices as well as for automotive infotainment systems 

all other  license revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 was flat at 2640 million  for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 75 of total revenue for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014 and 74 of total revenue for fiscal year 2013 revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy therefore if we experience product transition challenges if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines our gross margin may be negatively impacted 

our overall gross margin was 555  549  and 520  for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase over these fiscal years was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our gpu business partially offset by lower tegra business margins 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 594 million 501 million and 899 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 13 12 and 21 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 324 million 434 million and 537 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 11 and 13 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 06 01 and 08 in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 due to richer product mix resulting from strong sales of highend geforce gtx gpu products based on our maxwell architecture and the volume increase in our tesla accelerated computing products the increase in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a combination of a richer product mix of our highend geforce gtx gpu tesla high performance computing and quadro professional workstation products lower inventory provisions for excess inventory in fiscal year 2014 also contributed to the increase 

tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 and during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 these decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline in margins of our tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products which have had higher gross margins and smartphone and automotive module products which have had comparably lower gross margins 

operating expenses 



  

research and development 

research and development expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 compensation and benefits increased by 565 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense offsetting this increase was a 389 million decrease in engineering development expenses 

research and development expenses increased by 16  in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 compensation and benefits increased by 1019 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs the growth in engineering employees also drove an increase in facilities and it support expense of 346 million purchases of computer and software supplies of 141 million and depreciation and amortization of 110 million in addition engineering development expenses increased by 232 million primarily related to the ramp up of tegra products 

sales general and administrative 

sales general and administrative expenses increased by 10  in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 compensation and benefits increased by 537 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense facilities costs increased by 103 million as we expanded our offices internationally and leased an office building within the boundaries of our main santa clara campus offsetting these increases were a decrease in outside professional fees of 88 million as well as more favorable international taxes and government subsidies 

sales general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 compensation and benefits increased by 379 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs offsetting this increase were the absence of both a 201 million charge for a charitable contribution and a charge of 31 million for a class action settlement that we recorded in fiscal year 2013 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 

interest income was 281 million  171 million  and 199 million  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in december 2013 in interest bearing securities the decrease in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 

interest expense was 461 million  104 million  and 33 million  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increases in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 compared to fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in december 2013 

other income and expense 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates 

net other income expense was  139 million   74 million  and  28 million  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a nonaffiliated investment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and losses from foreign currency remeasurement the increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment 

   

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of  1242 million   703 million  and  995 million  during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 165  138  and 150  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to united states tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 

our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35  due to income earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower favorable recognition of the us federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonus jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits

liquidity and capital resources   





as of january 25 2015  we had 462 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities a decrease of 485 million  from the end of fiscal year 2014  our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration 

  

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses partially offset by an increase in inventories resulting from the introduction of newly launched maxwellbased gpus and certain tegra socs and shield devices and an increase in accounts receivable cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a decrease in operating assets offset by a decrease in net income the decrease in operating assets was driven mainly by a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from strong collections and linear monthly shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and a decrease in inventories 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 decreased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 driven primarily by capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014 for new technology licenses and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations 

cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from our repurchase of  8136 million  of shares of our common stock and our cash dividend payments totaling 1865 million  these uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of 1535 million  from common stock issued under our employee stock plans cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the net proceeds of 148 billion we received from the convertible note offering that was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 as well as cash proceeds of 702 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans concurrent with the convertible note offering we used net proceeds of 1080 million to fund the related note hedge and warrant transactions during fiscal year 2014 we also used 8873 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid 1813 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents debt securities of corporations and united states government and its agencies assetbacked securities mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and foreign government bonds these investments are denominated in united states dollars as of january 25 2015  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities

net realized gains were  01 million   24 million  and  05 million  for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of january 25 2015  we had a net unrealized gain of  84 million  which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of  110 million  offset by  26 million  of gross unrealized losses as of january 26 2014  we had a net unrealized gain of  48 million  which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of 72 million  offset by  24 million  of gross unrealized losses 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated two  customers accounted for 30  of our accounts receivable balance at january 25 2015  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 25 2015 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 172 billion held within the united states and 290 billion held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws as of january 25 2015 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 227 billion of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards further in addition to the 172 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where us income tax may otherwise be due accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states 

dividend payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the united states for fiscal year 2015 we made total cash dividend payments of 1865 million  and repurchased 8136 million  of our common stock utilizing a significant amount of our us cash balance previously taxed as of january 25 2015  

convertible notes 

on december 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 convertible senior notes or the notes due in 2018 and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions and used 143 million to repurchase shares of our common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions the notes will mature on december 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date as of january 25 2015 none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

  

capital return to shareholders 

our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 370 billion of our common stock through january 2016 as of january 25 2015  we had repurchased 32652 million of that amount leaving up to 4348 million  available under this authorization through january 2016 during fiscal year 2015 we repurchased 444 million shares of our common stock for 8136 million and paid 1865 million in cash dividends  equivalent to 0085 per share on a quarterly basis or 034 per share on an annual basis  to our common shareholders as a result we returned 10 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition share repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent shareholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

 

we expect to spend approximately 1500 million to 2000 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2016 primarily for facilities emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january 25 2015

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 25 2015  and january 26 2014  we had 462 billion  and 467 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents debt securities of corporations and united states government and its agencies assetbacked securities mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and foreign government bonds as of january 25 2015  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities all of our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

as of january 25 2015  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 26 million   28 million  please refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 25 2015  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 35  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 30  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa3 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2  5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 57 million   144 million  

on december 2 2013 we issued 150 billion  of 100  convertible senior notes due 2018 or the notes the notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets since the notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of the notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  was 05 million  47  million and 15  million respectively 

sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 

  

 we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 25 2015

increasingly devices are becoming smarter and more connected there will be smart tvs that respond to voice and gesture commands smart monitors powered by android making a pc optional and watches and jewelry that recognize voice commands and make calls our mobile vision is to put tegra into every device where visual computing is valued 

our strategies 

extend technology leadership in visual computing  we believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion of computing and essential to new computing experiences that define the future of computing we apply our expertise in these areas to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications we focus our significant rd depth and scale to extend our visual computing leadership 

enable and deliver the worlds best gaming experiences   by focusing on open platforms and endtoend experiences we aim to bring the highest fidelity and quality to any gaming device we have a broad portfolio of products and technologies optimized for gamers  gpus and software mobile socs valueadded solutions such as geforce experience and tegrazone differentiated devices like shield and technologies and appliances for highquality streaming in grid 

revolutionize computing with the parallel processing capability of the gpu   nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing platform that leverages the thousands of massively parallel processors inside an nvidia gpu to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required by a cpu and at a fraction of the power consumption we work with developers worldwide who write programs for the cuda platform using various highlevel programming languages developers are able to accelerate applications in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis and big data analytics 

extend our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloud computing platforms   mobile cloud and saas are driving changes in the computer industry we believe visual computing will be a key component in this new computing paradigm we want to enable interactive graphics applications like games movie and photo editors and design software to be accessed from any computer and from anywhere    we also believe that the user experience in vdis such as those enabled by citrix and vmware should be indistinguishable from traditional nonvirtual environments 

leverage our processors and visual computing expertise to create differentiated devices   we leverage our significant rd depth and scale to create differentiated products including shield shield is intended to attract modern gamers who want to play on open platforms we believe shield also enhances the strategic position of tegra for example by attracting more games to tegrazone which will in turn make every tegrapowered device more enjoyable 

use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts  we believe our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset than can be monetized by licensing our technology to customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products such license and development arrangements may further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology 

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile soc products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

in the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production 

as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 11  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2014  

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products 

 backlog   

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

  

manufacturing   

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

inventory and working capital 

  

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands 

  

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 253  to 467 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014  compared with the end of fiscal year 2013  primarily due to our issuance of 15 billion in convertible senior notes in december 2013 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and our intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers we believe in leveraging our significant rd depth and scale to create differentiated products 

  

as of january 26 2014  we had 6384  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2014  2013 and 2012 we incurred research and development expense of  13358 million  11473 million  and  10026 million  respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share  

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

 

 

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds accelerated processing unit or apu products as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted 

patents and proprietary rights 

 we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2014 to september 2033 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

we have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements 

employees 

  

as of january 26 2014  we had 8808  employees 6384  of whom were engaged in research and development and 2424  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters for additional detail see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters  our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities ”

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impacted  

the market for our products is extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services 

we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do in order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive and meet the demands of the markets we serve we expect to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development our ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability to 

 if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intel and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds apu product as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future pc builders and consumers may move away from the use of discrete gpus which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to decline 

we are implementing a business strategy to license our gpu cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers although we have engaged in licensing in the past we are now engaging a broader market with new and existing competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies we cannot be assured of the extent of the demand for licenses to our gpu cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio or that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets 

our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessful 

in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make multiyear investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve consumer andor market acceptance of them in a timely manner 

our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability to 

 we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have faced challenges in managing product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

if we are unable to achieve consumer and market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed 

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as cloudbased computing appliances servers automotive technology smartphones tablets video game consoles and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad consumer and market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such consumer and market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving consumer and market acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will suffer 

we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that we 

 14 

 if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

furthermore our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter 

because the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have a readily available alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results     

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to consumers of communications and pcrelated products within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to consumers in the smartphone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden because smartphone tablet and pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we sell our products to a limited number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was approximately 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and approximately 13 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively   approximately 23 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 26 2014 and approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

revenue from our largest customer has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmed 

to achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels 

our past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operations 

our revenue may fluctuate while a majority of our operating expenses are a factor of multiyear investments ahead of when revenue is received which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations   

our operating expenses are primarily related to multiyear research and development investments ahead of the revenue received from the products which are produced our research and development expenses totaled 134 billion  115 billion  and 100 billion  in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

 17 

 if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business 

we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 19 

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our reporting units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example in the most recent impairment test of our tegra processor reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit only exceeded its carrying value by 17 if the future operating results of the tegra processor reporting unit are significantly lower than our estimates the goodwill assigned to tegra processor could be impaired which would negatively impact our results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price  

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant for example in july 2012 unauthorized third parties gained access to certain user information on our online forums we have strengthened security in an effort to minimize future attacks however hackers may continue to target our security controls in the future and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be able to prevent future breaches of our website andor attacks on our products 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our business 

our future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders because the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the development of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results 

if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results      

our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial results 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn that started in the second half of 2008 ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 75  74 and 78 of our revenue for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

 if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert managements attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable ways 

the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer 

our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 

our cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio as of january 26 2014 consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises assetbacked securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines designed to preserve principal minimize risk and monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes and a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises assetbacked securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 

should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 26 2014 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters   

our common stock price has at times experienced substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses  

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities due to changes in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 in addition in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us for alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products please refer to note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details on these lawsuits 

there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing so 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged invalidated infringed circumvented or misappropriated by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement third parties may also claim that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers’ trade secrets or confidential information 

an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results   

changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business   

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

 we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 25 

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

during fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 36 acres of land and twelve commercial buildings  and eventually expect to break ground on a new building for a corporate headquarters campus in santa clara we also own real property in india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

 expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1363 million  1367 million and 1364 million for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results 

to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results     

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations  

       in december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2018 or 100 notes our substantial indebtedness may 

 the exercise of warrants issued to goldman sachs  co or goldman concurrently with our 100 notes would and the conversion of our 100 notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders  

the warrants issued concurrently with our 100 notes shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless goldman notifies us otherwise any issuance by us of additional shares to goldman upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders moreover the conversion of our 100 notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 100 notes any sales in the public market by goldman of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 100 notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory 

there is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the areas of conflict recent us legislation includes sec disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries for which the first report is due on may 31 2014 for the 2013 calendar year the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any “conflict” minerals in our products also because our supply chain is complex we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products resulting in reputational challenges with our customers and stockholders some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products although we expect to be able to file the required report on time we are dependent upon the information provided by our many suppliers to the extent that the information we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining such information do not fulfill the sec’s diligence requirements we could also face sec enforcement risks 

future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation 

while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer our chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock     

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or the interpretation of them can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules such as the possible upcoming changes to revenue recognition and lease accounting standards or changes in practices such as changes to auditing standards promulgated by the public company accounting oversight board could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 28 

 on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol nvda public trading of our common stock began on january 22 1999 prior to that there was no public market for our common stock as of march 7 2014 we had approximately 381 registered stockholders not including those shares held in street or nominee name the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales price for our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global select market 



dividend policy   

prior to fiscal year 2013 we had never declared or paid any dividend on shares of our common stock on november 8 2012 we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program this initial quarterly dividend of 0075 per share was equivalent to 030 per share on an annual basis on november 7 2013 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 13 to 0085 per share which was equivalent to 034 per share on an annual basis a subsequent cash dividend of 0085 per share was declared on february 12 2014 payable on march 20 2014 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on february 27 2014   in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013 we paid 1813 million  and 469 million  respectively in cash dividends to our common stockholders 

our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board of directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends   in fiscal year 2014 based upon our earnings and profits 85 of our dividend payments were considered qualified dividends and 15 of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes we expect that a portion of our dividend payments in fiscal year 2015 may also be considered a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

beginning august 2004 our board of directors authorized us subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock most recently in november 2013 the board extended the previously authorized repurchase program through january 2016 and authorized an additional 10 billion for an aggregate of 37 billion under the repurchase program through january 26 2014 we have repurchased an aggregate of 1612 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 245 billion as of january 26 2014 we are authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to 125 billion through january 2016     in november 2013 we announced the intention to return 10 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends   

the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

the following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the three months ended january 26 2014 in millions except per share amounts 



as part of the repurchase program during february 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement or asr with an investment bank under which we prepaid 5000 million to purchase shares of our common stock in february 2014 the investment bank delivered 206 million shares to us we expect to receive additional shares at the time of settlement of the asr in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 the price we will ultimately pay per share will be no more than the volumeweighted average price of our common stock over the period of the asr 

in addition to our share repurchase program we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit or rsu awards under our equity incentive program during fiscal year 2014 we withheld approximately 19 million shares at a total cost of 273 million through net share settlements please refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans

please refer to note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenue recognition 

  

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment   

  

our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated   

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems the oems are not our direct customers and the quantity and mix of demand they place on cemodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately 05 of total revenue   

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed mdf amounts that have been previously recorded against revenue and subsequently expired unclaimed are reversed to revenue such amounts have not been significant   

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns   

license and development revenue 

  

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period   

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue  

royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee   

  

accounts receivable 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 

as of january 26 2014  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 08 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 4435 million of the 4435 million 841 million was covered by credit insurance and 231 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit the amount of our cumulative bad debt charges over the last three fiscal years has not been significant as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 01 and 04 during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 as of january 26 2014  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

  inventories 

  

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup   

situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 501 million 899 million and 530 million unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 12 21 and 13 in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 434 million 537 million and 711 million favorably impacting our gross margin by 11 13 and 18 in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions and sales of items previously writtenoff or writtendown was a 01 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2014 a 08 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2013 and a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 

during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of certain older generations of gpu and tegra processor products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products 

please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion 

warranty liabilities 

cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field 

  

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

united states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of january 26 2014 we had a valuation allowance of 2445 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4279 million as of january 26 2014 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified three reporting units gpu professional solutions and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of january 26 2014 was 1353 million 951 million and 4128 million  respectively determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

both a qualitative and quantitative approach are applicable accounting standards for the assessment of goodwill impairment with the qualitative approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform an analysis evaluating factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions the competitive environment the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and actual revenue results for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value no further goodwill impairment testing is required 

for those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of reporting units by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business 

when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for all three reporting units and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our gpu and professional solutions reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values and the fair value of our tegra processor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 17 as such even if we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting units being less than their carrying values as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date of october 27 2013 the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units 

in particular the fair value of our tegra reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17 the fair value of this reporting unit was assessed using a combination of income and market approaches the underlying assumptions we used in assessing the fair value of the tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumptions around future revenue growth rates gross margins operating expense investment levels overall market growth rates our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rates to apply to future cash flows if the actual future results of the tegra reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing its fair value the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could decline a future decline in the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could result a charge to our earnings as a result of a writedown of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit 

our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

 cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholder’s equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we do not have any investments classified as level 3 as of january 26 2014  

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  

 stockbased compensation 

we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model 

we determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts 

our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

   

         using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during fiscal year 2014  



  

 we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our espp during fiscal year 2014  using the following assumptions 

  



  

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 



fiscal years ended january 26 2014 january 27 2013 and january 29 2012 

  

revenue 

fiscal year 2014 vs fiscal year 2013 

revenue was 413 billion  for fiscal year 2014  and 428 billion  for fiscal year 2013  a decrease of 4  a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows 

gpu business gpu business revenue for fiscal year 2014  increased by 7  to 347 billion  when compared to 325 billion  for fiscal year 2013  this growth was largely attributable to strength in our highend geforce gtx gpus which grew 18 driven by gaming market segment demand the gpu business also benefited from a 37 increase in tesla highperformance computing revenue and a 10 increase in quadro workstation revenue in fiscal year 2014 offsetting these growth areas were declines in the overall market for desktop pcs and notebooks which contributed to lower unit volumes of our mainstream geforce gpus 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue decreased by 48  to 3980 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 7644 million  for fiscal year 2013  this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our previous generation tegra 3based products for smartphones and tablet devices additionally sales of our embedded products for entertainment devices and revenue from license fees related to game consoles also decreased during fiscal year 2014 these decreases were partially offset by the sales of tegra 4based products for smartphones and tablet devices as well as infotainment systems for automobiles 

all other  license revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 was flat at 2640 million between fiscal years 2014 and 2013 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

revenue was 428 billion for fiscal year 2013 and 400 billion for fiscal year 2012 an increase of 7 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue of 325 billion for fiscal year 2013 increased by 2 compared to 319 billion for fiscal year 2012 this growth was largely attributable to the introduction of gpus based on our kepler architecture in fiscal year 2013 geforce notebook revenues increased on the strength of keplerbased design wins on the ivy bridge platform strong demand for keplerbased geforce desktop gpu products also contributed to the increase in gpu business revenues the gpu business also benefited from a greater than 36 increase in tesla revenue in fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases were a decrease in quadro revenue which we believe was due primarily to general weakness in western europe and a continued decline in sales of our mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 

tegra processor busines s tegra processor business revenue increased by 29 to 7644 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to 5912 million for fiscal year 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our tegra 3based smartphones and tablet devices as we transitioned from the previous generation tegra 2based products and introduced our tegra3 based processors in windows rtbased tablet devices additionally revenues for our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices also increased during fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue from license fees and other revenue related to game consoles 

      all other  the increase in revenue is also due to revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 we recognized 2640 million in related licensing revenue during the entire twelve months of fiscal year 2013 while fiscal year 2012 only included 2200 million in related revenue  reflecting only ten months of the corresponding revenue 

  

concentration of revenue 

  

we generated 75  74 and 78 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2014  2013 and 2012 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

  

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 549 520 and 514 for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows 

fiscal year 2014 vs fiscal year 2013 

our gross margin increased to 549  in fiscal year 2014  from 520  in fiscal year 2013  the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by a combination of increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our highend geforce gtx gpu tesla high performance computing and quadro professional workstation products the lower sales unit volumes of our lower margin mainstream gpus and tegra processors also contributed to the gross margin increase gross margin also improved due to the favorable impact of lower net inventory provisions in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 501 million and 899 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 12 and 21 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 434 million and 537 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 favorably impacting our gross margin by 11 and 13 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 01 and 08 in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 this was primarily due to a combination of increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our highend geforce gtx gpu tesla high performance computing and quadro professional workstation products lower inventory provisions for excess inventory in fiscal year 2014 also contributed to the increase in gross margin 

  

tegra processor business   the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 this decrease was driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline in margins of our tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products which have had higher gross margins and smartphone and automotive module products which have had comparably lower gross margins 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

our gross margin increased to 520 in fiscal year 2013 from 514 in fiscal year 2012 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our highend geforce desktop products plus tesla and quadro products the addition of a full year of revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel compared to ten months of such corresponding revenue in fiscal year 2012 also contributed to the improvement in gross margin offsetting these were the unfavorable impact of higher net provisions for inventory in fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 

charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 899 million and 530 million for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 21 and 13 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or written down totaled 537 million and 711 million for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 favorably impacting our gross margin by 13 and 18 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was a 08 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2013 and a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 this was primarily due to a richer product mix of our keplerbased highend 28 nanometer geforce desktop products and our quadro products memory margins strengthened on improved market pricing these favorable contributors to gross margin were primarily offset by higher net inventory provisions in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 

  

tegra processor business   the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased slightly during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 this decrease was the result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of revenue from areas such as license fees and other revenues related to game consoles which typically have higher gross margins than our tegra products offset by a higher mix of revenue from sales of our tegra products which grew substantially during the year 

  

  

operating expenses   



  

research and development 

fiscal year 2014 vs fiscal year 2013 

research and development expenses increased by 1885 million  or 16  year over year this increase was primarily due to a 1019 million increase in compensation and benefits expense due to increased hiring of engineering talent the growth in engineering employees also drove an increase in facilities and it support expense of 346 million purchases of computer and software supplies of 141 million and depreciation and amortization of 110 million in addition engineering development expenses increased by 232 million primarily related to the ramp up of our next generation tegra products 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

research and development expenses increased by 1447 million or 14 year over year this increase was primarily due to a 994 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to hire engineering talent to invest in our business depreciation and amortization increased by 98 million driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of icera in fiscal year 2012 as well as purchases of additional hardware and licenses during the year engineering development expenses increased by 68 million related to the ramp of our nextgeneration gpu architecture kepler designed for 28nm technology and our next generation tegra processor architecture tegra 4 

sales general and administrative 

fiscal year 2014 vs fiscal year 2013 

 sales general and administrative expenses increased by  49 million  or 1  year over year this increase was primarily due to a 379 million increase in compensation and benefits expense due to increased hiring offsetting this increase were the absence of both a 201 million charge for a charitable contribution and a charge of 31 million for a class action settlement that we recorded in the prior fiscal year 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

 sales general and administrative expenses increased by 252 million or 6 year over year this increase was primarily due to a 216 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our business also contributing to the increase was a 201 million expense for the net present value of a charitable contribution that we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 104 million due to an overall decrease in professional services costs during fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 due to a general decline in litigationrelated costs and the absence of services associated with acquisition activity in fiscal year 2013 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 

interest income was 171 million  199 million  and 191 million  in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in fiscal year 2014 from the prior year was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 

 interest expense was 104 million  33 million  and 31 million  in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase from prior year is attributable to 25 million for coupon interest and 46 million for debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we expect to incur annual coupon interest expense of 150 million and annual debt discount amortization of 280 million for fiscal year 2015 

  other income and expense 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sale of investment in nonaffiliated companies and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates net other income expense was  74 million   28 million  and  10 million  in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain of 31 million from sale of a nonaffiliated investment 

   

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of  703 million   995 million  and  823 million  during fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 138  150  and 124  in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

our effective tax rate on income or loss before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35  due to income or loss earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35  favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal rd tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonus jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits 

please refer to note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources   





as of january 26 2014  we had 467 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 9439 million  from the end of fiscal year 2013  our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration 

 operating activities 

  

operating activities consist primarily of net income or loss for the fiscal period offset by the impact of noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization expense and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and inventories 

cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily due to favorable changes in operating assets offset by a decrease in net income the favorable change in operating assets was driven mainly by a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from strong collections and linear monthly shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and a decrease in inventories 

cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a decrease in net income and unfavorable changes in operating assets compared to fiscal year 2012 for example accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and inventory increased as a result of the production ramp of keplerbased gpu products 

investing activities 

 investing activities consist primarily of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities acquisitions of businesses and purchases of property and equipment including leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 driven primarily by capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014 for new technology licenses and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013 decreased from fiscal year 2012 due primarily to the acquisition of icera in fiscal year 2012 we used 1833 million towards capital expenditures in fiscal year 2013 mainly for the purchase of new research and development equipment testing equipment to support our increased production requirements technology licenses software intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations 

  

financing activities 

financing activities consist primarily of borrowing activities such as convertible debt issuances or capital leases and equityrelated activities such as stock repurchases and dividend payments 

cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the net proceeds of 148 billion we received from the convertible note offering that was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 as well as cash proceeds of 702 million  from common stock issued under our employee stock plans concurrent with the convertible note offering we used net proceeds of 108 million to fund the related note hedge and warrant transactions during fiscal year 2014 we also used 8873 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid 1813 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to our repurchase of 1000 million of shares of our common stock and our first quarterly cash dividend payment of 469 million these uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of 649 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a noncash tax benefit of 687 million related to employee stockbased compensation 

liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars as of january 26 2014  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities 

all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our statement of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

as of january 26 2014  and january 27 2013  we had  467 billion  and  373 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration as specified in our investment policy guidelines these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument as of january 26 2014  we were in compliance with our investment policy as of january 26 2014  our investments in us government agencies and us government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 42  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 27  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa3 or better rated securities 

we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 26 2014  based on our quarterly impairment review we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2014  

net realized gains were  24 million   05 million  and  04 million  for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively as of january 26 2014  we had a net unrealized gain of  48 million  which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of  72 million  offset by  24 million  of gross unrealized losses as of january 27 2013  we had a net unrealized gain of  109 million  which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of 117 million  offset by  08 million  of gross unrealized losses 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated one  customer accounted for approximately 23  of our accounts receivable balance at january 26 2014  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure as of january 26 2014  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

 our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 26 2014 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 206 billion held within the united states and 261 billion held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws as of january 26 2014 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 196 billion of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards further in addition to the 206 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where us income tax may otherwise be due accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states 

  

convertible notes 

on december 2 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes or the notes due in 2018 and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions and used 143 million to repurchase shares of our common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions in addition to using the net proceeds to fund the transaction costs note hedge and warrant transactions we further intend to use the proceeds to repurchase of shares of our common stock and pay cash dividends pursuant to our recently announced fiscal year 2015 capital return program and for general corporate purposes    

the notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum the notes will mature on december 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date as of january 26 2014 none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met and the notes are therefore classified as a longterm liability on our consolidated balance sheets please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 37 billion of our common stock through january 2016 as of january 26 2014 we had repurchased 245 billion of that amount leaving up to 125 billion available under this authorization through january 2016 we have announced our intention to return 10 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividends as part of our capital return program during february 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase 5000 million in shares of our common stock please refer to note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion regarding our stock repurchase program 

  

cash dividend program 

prior to fiscal year 2013 we had never declared or paid any dividend on shares of our common stock on november 8 2012 we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program this initial quarterly dividend of 0075 per share was equivalent to 030 per share on an annual basis on november 7 2013 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 13 to 0085 per share which was equivalent to 034 per share on an annual basis a subsequent cash dividend of 0085 per share was declared on february 12 2014 payable on march 20 2014 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on february 27 2014  in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013 we paid 1813 million  and 469 million  respectively in dividends to our common stockholders 

our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board of directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends 

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition stock repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

 

we expect to spend approximately  1500 million  to  1750 million  for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2015 primarily for leasehold improvements emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations 

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while a majority of our operating expenses are a factor of multiyear investments ahead of when revenue is received which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 26 2014  and january 27 2013  we had 467 billion  and 373 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 26 2014  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

  

 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

  

as of january 26 2014  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately 215 million  

  

other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 26 2014  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 42  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 27  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa3 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately 56  140 million  

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  was 47 million  15  million and 16  million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

 we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 26 2014

 grid a firstofitskind technology introduced this year makes it possible to run graphicsintensive applications remotely on a server in the datacenter instead of locally on a pc or workstation it enables pixels to be processed compressed and streamed so quickly that it appears that work is being done by a powerful computer adjacent to the viewing screen as the processingintensive application resides in the server and only the final image is streamed complex applications can now be accessed from virtually any computing device designers sales and marketing professionals can click on an icon and run a professional application from a pc mac ipad or android tablet nvidia offers grid graphics modules and software that oems can include in their standard servers 

  mobile 

mobile computing devices in various form factors are expected to continue to drive the user experience according to strategy analytics more than 800 million smartphones and 180 million tablets are expected to ship in 2013 approaching the number of laptop pcs sold 

the foundation of our mobile computing strategy is the tegra processor which harnesses our expertise in computer chip software and system design while leveraging our worldleading expertise in visual computing in just a few short years we have established a presence in the industry and have achieved many industry firsts 

 

our strategy is to innovate faster than the competition introducing new features and capabilities to differentiate the user experience in doing so we leverage our pc proficiency and harness industry trends that we believe favor nvidias core graphics expertise 

the mobile market is more than smartphones to us the combination of tegra and our significant computing software assets enables us to address the many new markets for connected smart devices for example 60 million cars are sold each year and all we believe will eventually include multiple tegralike computers that augment our driving experience they will ensure our safety and the safety of those around us search and navigate to destinations through headsup displays and enhance our comfort and enjoyment cars will be connected to our mobile devices they may someday drive themselves out of parking garages to meet their owners with the seat and temperature already set to their liking 

increasingly devices will be smarter and connected there will be smart tvs that respond to voice and gesture commands smart monitors powered by android making a pc optional watches and jewelry that recognize voice commands and make calls our mobile strategy is to put tegra into every device where visual computing is valued 

cloud 

the computer industry has gone through several major industry shifts  from clientservers to pcs to mobile devices connected to the internet but none appear to be as sweeping as cloud computing in which computing devices are connected to the cloud and applications are served as a service 

by extending visual computing into the cloud nvidia is expanding the application of the gpu beyond the pc into the server and datacenter virtualizing the gpu enables it to be shared by many concurrent users and we have created technologies that allow the rendered image to be quickly compressed and streamed to a distant computer 

nvidias grid visual computing appliance is a first of its kind designed to let users interact remotely with graphicsintensive applications for entertainment and business by making graphics applications available on a network or in the cloud we aim to expand the gpus addressable market to virtually any connected display grid is designed to stream a graphics application the way netflix streams a movie it will enable adobe photoshop to be run remotely and interacted with as if the application were on the pc grid is a computing appliance for many users to share graphics processing much the same way that a router is a computing appliance designed for networking 

initial target markets of the nvidia grid appliance are cloud gaming and softwareasaservice saas hosting of graphicsintensive applications for cloud gaming we are partnering with cloud gaming middleware providers around the world who in turn work with large service and media providers for hosting graphicsintensive design applications including autodesk adobe and solidworks we are partnering with valueadded resellers specialized in serving the computing needs of designers and artists 

our strategies 

extend technology leadership in visual computing  we believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion of computing and essential to new computing experiences that define the future of computing we apply worldleading expertise in these areas to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications we focus our significant rd depth and scale to extend our visual computing leadership 

enable and deliver the worlds best gaming experiences   by focusing on open platforms and endtoend experiences we aim to bring the highest fidelity and quality to any gaming device with a broad portfolio of products and technologies optimized for gamers  gpus and software mobile systemsonachip valueadded solutions such as geforce experience and tegrazone differentiated devices like project shield and technologies and appliances for highquality streaming in grid  nvidia is committed to ensuring that gaming on our platforms is delightful and exciting 

revolutionize computing with the parallel processing capability of the gpu   nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the thousands of massively parallel processors inside an nvidia gpu to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required by a cpu we work with developers worldwide who write application programs for the cuda architecture using various highlevel programming languages developers are able to accelerate algorithms in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing xray image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis we believe the work we are doing around gpu computing is an important step to the future of how computing will be done 

extend our visual computing leadership into mobile and cloud computing platforms   mobile cloud and saas are driving changes in the computer industry although a great challenge to make possible due to the significant computational intensity of graphics we believe visual computing will be a key component in this new computing paradigm as with books and music we want to enable interactive graphics applications like games movie and photo editors and design software to be accessed from any computer and from anywhere     

leverage our processors and visual computing expertise to create differentiated devices  we recently announced project shield an nvidia developed and branded android device designed for gaming and featuring our latest processor tegra 4 we believe project shield will attract modern gamers who want to play on open platforms and untethered to the living room we believe project shield will also enhance the strategic position of tegra we believe project shield will attract more games to tegrazone which will in turn make every tegrapowered device more enjoyable just as project shield is a device built around tegra we leveraged our gpu to create a firstofitskind visual computing appliance called grid leveraging our gpu and visual computing expertise the nvidia grid is a visual computing appliance designed to serve graphicsintensive applications to many users simultaneously 

use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts  we believe our technology leadership in graphics and mobile computing offers the opportunity to license our technology to strategic customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products we expect to enter into license and development arrangements some of which may involve significant customization of our intellectual property components and further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology 

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile systemonchip products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

  

in the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production 

  

as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 13  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013  

  

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

 backlog 

  

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

 our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 

  

manufacturing 

  

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd siliconware precision industries company ltd and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from nanya technology corporation ibidenco ltd and unimicron technology corporation 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

inventory and working capital 

  

we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

  

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 191  at the end of fiscal year 2013  compared with the end of fiscal year 2012  we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for project shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers 

  

as of january 27 2013  we had 5783  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2013  2012 and 2011 we incurred research and development expense of  11473 million  10026 million and 8488 million respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share  

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

 

 

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted 

patents and proprietary rights 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from august 2013 to february 2032 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

  

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

  

as of january 27 2013 we had 7974  employees 5783  of whom were engaged in research and development and 2191  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental regulatory compliance 

to date we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters for additional detail see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters  our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities ”

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impacted  

the market for our products is extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services 

we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do in order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under developmentour ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability to 

 

if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance or the gpu attach rate if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future our gpu attach rate could decrease which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to decline 

our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessful 

in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner 

our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability to 

 

we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

if we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed 

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as smartphones tablets and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving marketing acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will suffer 

additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addin card and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the markets do not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 

we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that we 

 

if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities may also develop high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier than our thirdparty foundries if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter we experienced continued 28 nanometersupply constraints in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 

because the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

   business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal information technology or it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer 

 a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden since pc cell phone and tablet manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers one customer accounted for 13 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2013 and 11 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2012 and another customer accounted for 12 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2011 approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 and 20 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 29 2012 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient 

sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmed 

to achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels 

our past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operations 

our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 369 352 and 326 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter it is also difficult to accurately forecast revenue and we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impacted 

any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

 

if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial results 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

 our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses  

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities due to changes in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

   our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 

any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business most recently we completed our acquisition of icera inc an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations product lines and technology of icera we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition which could adversely affect our business plans and operating results 

we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price  

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant for example in july 2012 unauthorized third parties gained access to certain user information on our online forums we have strengthened security in an effort to minimize future attacks 

however hackers may continue to target our security controls in the future and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be able to prevent future breaches of our website andor attacks on our products 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our business 

our future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results 

if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net warranty charges of 4664 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations and shipped after july 2008 please see the risk entitled “we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business” for further information regarding this product defect      

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 74  78 and 83 of our revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 27 2013 we had offices in 16 countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

our international operations in china finland france germany hong kong india italy japan korea russia singapore sweden switzerland united arab emirates taiwan and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert managements attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable ways 

the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 

our cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio as of january 27 2013 consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines designed to preserve principal minimize risk and monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes and a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 

should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 27 2013 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters   

we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

for example we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 in addition in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against for alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products as of january 27 2013 we recorded a total cumulative net warranty charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configuration the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs although we believe this issue has been nearly fully remediated we remain committed to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details on these lawsuits 

  

there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

   our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 

 changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business 

  

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 25 

   

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or that we have agreed to indemnify our customers for certain claims of infringement 

an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

 if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

during fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings and expect to break ground on a new building for our corporate headquarters campus in santa clara in fiscal year 2014 we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

 26 

 

expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1367 million 1364 million and 1004 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results 

to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results     

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

under us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory 

there is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the democratic republic of congo new us legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any “conflict” minerals in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products 

future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation 

while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer interim chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock     

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules or practices including the possible conversion to unified international accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

3dfx 

on december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below 

in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 700 million  paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 500 million  the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities 

on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million  the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million 

in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million  to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million  related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million  related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustees case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as “property” subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the “property” identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 700 million that nvidia paid “reasonably equivalent” to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction” this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidias favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court 

the district courts hearing on the trustees appeal was held on june 10 2009 on december 20 2010 the district court issued an order affirming the bankruptcy courts entry of summary judgment in nvidias favor on january 19 2011 the trustee filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit the appeal is currently pending 

while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustees case still remains pending on appeal accordingly we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million  56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx  that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustees case 

   product defect litigation and securities cases

our businesses 

we have two primary reporting segments  the gpu business and the tegra processor business during the last several years we have operated and reported three reporting segments  the gpu business the professional solutions business and the consumer products business however during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we began reporting two segments to reflect the way we are now managing our businesses internally which is based on whether the underlying products leverage our gpu or our tegra processor technologies comparative periods presented reflect this change 

our gpu business leverages our gpu technology across multiple end markets it now comprises four primary product lines including geforce for desktop and notebook pcs and macs quadro for professional workstations tesla for highperformance servers and workstations and nvidia grid for server graphics solutions it also includes other related products licenses and revenue supporting the gpu business such as memory products our tegra processor business comprises product lines primarily based on our tegra soc and modem processor technologies this includes tegra for smartphones and tablets for both android and windows rtbased devices automotive computers including infotainment and navigation systems and gaming devices such as project shield it also includes other related products licenses and revenue supporting the tegra processor business such as icera baseband processors and rf transceivers embedded products and licenses and other revenue associated with game consoles 

in addition to the two reporting segments discussed above the “all other” category primarily includes licensing revenue from our patent cross licensing agreement with intel 

  recent developments future objectives and challenges 

gpu business 

during fiscal year 2013 we launched our new kepler gpu architecture across our gpu products kepler was initially launched in our geforce desktop and notebook pc products in early fiscal year 2013 and gradually powered tesla and quadro devices during the second half of fiscal year 2013 our kepler products are faster smaller and more power efficient than products based on our previous architecture 

in our tesla product line we introduced the k10 and k20 family of gpu accelerators based on the kepler architecture during fiscal year 2013 making the technology behind the worlds fastest supercomputer titan at oak ridge national laboratory available to all we also announced that the space research organization in india was utilizing their supercomputer for aerospace with gpu architecture or saga system to improve the design and analysis of new and existing satellite launch vehicles 

additionally we launched the grid vgx a firstofits kind technology which makes it possible to access graphicsintensive applications on a remote server from virtually any computing device anywhere by connecting to the cloud instead of on a local pc or workstation with our new grid vgx product line we are leveraging gpus beyond the pc into the server

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenue recognition 

  

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

  

our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense depending on the nature of the program mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

  

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 

  

accounts receivable 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 

as of january 27 2013 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 18 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 4736 million of the 4736 million 711 million was covered by credit insurance and 92 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit we have incurred cumulative bad debts of 08 million over the last three fiscal years as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 04 during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 as of january 27 2013 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 04 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

  inventories 

  

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our current inventory or our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted 

as of january 27 2013 our inventory reserve was 1185 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 150 and 306 during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 as of january 27 2013 our inventory reserve represented 220 of our gross inventory balance 

  

warranty liabilities 

cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

       during the three fiscal years ended january 30 2011 we recorded a cumulative net charge of 4759 million most of which was charged against cost of revenue to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs if the actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

  as of january 27 2013 we had a valuation allowance of 2248 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

  

  

our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4591 million as of january 27 2013 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations 

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

goodwill 

  

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we identified four reporting units for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

in fiscal year 2012 we early adopted an accounting standard update commonly referred to as a step zero approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing for those reporting units where a significant change or events occur and where potential impairment indicators exist we continue to utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing the fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities 

qualitative assessment 

in considering the step zero approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform a qualitative analysis evaluating factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions competitive environment operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and budgetedtoactual revenue results 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we utilized a qualitative analysis for two reporting units where no significant change occurred and no potential impairment indicators arose since the previous annual evaluation of goodwill and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units is more than their carrying values on a reporting unit basis 

our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

quantitative assessment 

we utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for two reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 23 and 208 we have considered both the income method and market method where applicable when determining the fair value of reporting units our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting primarily towards the income method to estimate the reporting units fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis while the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium 

our estimates of cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit the market method of determining the fair value of our reporting unit requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables 

  

any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting unit reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

 cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholder’s equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we do not have any investment classified as level 3 as of january 27 2013  

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  

 stockbased compensation 

 we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus we calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model 

we determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumption of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts 

prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on november 8 2012 the fair value of our equity awards was based on an expected dividend yield of 0 reflecting our prior history in which we had not paid and did not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to november 8 2012 we now use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield 

         additionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

         using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during fiscal year 2013 



  

 we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our espp during fiscal year 2013 using the following assumptions 

  



  

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 



fiscal years ended january 27 2013 january 29 2012 and january 30 2011 

  

revenue 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

revenue was 428 billion  for fiscal year 2013  and 400 billion  for fiscal year 2012  an increase of 71  a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows 

gpu business gpu business revenue increased by 20  to 32517 million  for fiscal year 2013  when compared to 31868 million  for fiscal year 2012  this growth was largely attributable to the introduction of gpus based on our kepler architecture in fiscal year 2013 geforce notebook revenues increased on the strength of keplerbased design wins on the ivy bridge platform strong demand for keplerbased geforce desktop gpu products also contributed to the increase in gpu business revenues the gpu business also benefited from a greater than 360 increase in tesla revenue in fiscal 2013 offsetting these increases were a decrease in quadro revenue which we believe was due primarily to general weakness in western europe and a continued decline in sales of our mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue increased by 293  to 7644 million  for fiscal year 2013  as compared to 5912 million  for fiscal year 2012  this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our tegra 3based smartphones and tablet devices as we transitioned from the previous generation tegra 2based products and introduced our tegra3 based processors in windows rtbased tablet devices additionally revenues for our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices also increased during fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue from license fees and other revenue related to game consoles 

all other the increase in revenue is also due to revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 we recognized 2640 million in related licensing revenue during the entire twelve months of fiscal year 2013 while fiscal year 2012 only included 2200 million in related revenue  reflecting only ten months of the corresponding revenue 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

  

revenue was 400 billion for fiscal year 2012 and 354 billion for fiscal year 2011 an increase of 128 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue decreased by 48 to 31868 million for fiscal year 2012 when compared to 33457 million for fiscal year 2011 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line memory sales also decreased due to lower sales volume as decreases in market price for memory made it attractive for addin card manufacturers to buy memory directly from the market rather than from us additionally our tesla product revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume offsetting these decreases were increases in geforce desktop and notebook revenues from continued market penetration of our fermi architecturebased gpus strength of our fermi architecture and resultant design wins on the sandy bridge platform contributed to the increase in geforce notebook revenues quadro revenues improved slightly as the average selling price or asp for workstation products improved due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 

tegra processor business   tegra processor business revenue increased by 1992  to 5912 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to 1976 million for fiscal year 2011 this increase in revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from the acceleration of our tegra 2 smartphone and tablet products in the mobile market and in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets revenue from development arrangements and license fees related to game consoles remained stable in fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011 

       all other revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of 2200 million of licensing revenue in fiscal year 2012 from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel that we entered into in january 2011 and began recognizing in april 2011 

concentration of revenue 

  

we generated 74  78 and 83 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

  

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 520 514 and 398 for fiscal years 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 

our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix however we may experience difficulties in the transition to new manufacturing processes we expect gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 to stay flat relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 

 a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

our gross margin increased to 520 in fiscal year 2013  from 514  in fiscal year 2012  the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our highend geforce desktop products plus tesla and quadro products the addition of a full year of revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel compared to ten months of such corresponding revenue in fiscal year 2012 also contributed to the improvement in gross margin offsetting these were the unfavorable impact of higher net provisions for inventory in fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 

our gross margin is favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 13 and 18 in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively conversely our gross margin is unfavorably impacted by provisions for new inventory reserves the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 08 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2013 and a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 

  gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 this was primarily due to a richer product mix of our keplerbased highend 28 nanometer geforce desktop products and our quadro products memory margins strengthened on improved market pricing these favorable contributors to gross margin were primarily offset by higher net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 

  

tegra processor business   the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased slightly during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 this decrease was the result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of revenue from areas such as license fees and other revenues related to game consoles which typically have higher gross margins than our tegra products offset by a higher mix of revenue from sales of our tegra products which grew substantially during the year 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

our gross margin increased to 514 in fiscal year 2012 from 398 in fiscal year 2011 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel entered into in january 2011 additionally the increase in unit sales and a richer product mix of our geforce desktop and notebook products and quadro workstation products as well as manufacturing cost efficiencies and strong management of inventory also helped our gross margin improve in fiscal year 2012 other favorable impacts to gross margin were the absence in fiscal year 2012 of a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of 1812 million recorded in fiscal year 2011 related to a weak diepacking material set and lower provisions for net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 18 and 19 in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 and a 30 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2011 

  gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011 this was primarily due to lower net provisions for inventory in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak diepackaging material set recorded in fiscal year 2011 higher unit sales and richer product mix of our geforce desktop and notebook products also improved gross margin for the gpu business in addition the gross margin for both quadro and tesla products remained stable during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 

tegra processor business  the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease was a result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of license fees and other revenue related to game consoles and a higher mix of revenue from our tegra products which grew substantially during fiscal year 2012 

  

 operating expenses   



  

research and development 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

research and development expenses increased by 1447 million  or 144  year over year this increase was primarily due to a 994 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to hire engineering talent to invest in our business depreciation and amortization increased by 98 million driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of icera in fiscal year 2012 as well as purchases of additional hardware and licenses during the year engineering development expenses increased by 68 million related to the ramp of our nextgeneration gpu architecture kepler designed for 28nm technology and our next generation tegra processor architecture tegra 4 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

research and development expenses increased by 1538 million or 181 year over year this increase was primarily driven by investments in our efforts to build next generation energy efficient computing architectures these efforts resulted in a 837 million increase in compensation and benefits expense and a 225 million increase in stockbased compensation development expenses increased by 90 million related to the ramp of our kepler gpu architecture designed for 28nm technology and our tegra 3 mobile computing architecture depreciation and amortization increased by 88 million driven primarily by amortization of licenses acquired during the year also contributing to the increase were other acquisitionrelated costs of 124 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we established for employees from our acquisition of icera in june 2011 and 60 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition 

sales general and administrative 

fiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 

 sales general and administrative expenses increased by  252 million  or 62  year over year this increase was primarily due to a 216 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our business also contributing to the increase was a 201 million expense for the net present value of a charitable contribution that we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 104 million due to an overall decrease in professional services costs during fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 due to a general decline in litigationrelated costs and the absence of services associated with acquisition activity in fiscal year 2013 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

 sales general and administrative expenses increased by 441 million or 122 year over year compensation and benefits expense increased by 295 million primarily attributable to employee personnel growth stockbased compensation increased by 105 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in employee personnel also contributing to the increase were 44 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of icera 35 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we established for icera employees and 22 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the icera acquisition offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 40 million due to lower litigationrelated costs and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 92 million due to certain software and leasehold improvements of buildings that became fully depreciated during fiscal year 2012 

legal settlement 

  

on january 10 2011 we entered into a sixyear cross licensing agreement with intel and also mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes the fair valued benefit prescribed to the legal settlement portion was 570 million and was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 

we expect operating expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 primarily due to employeerelated costs including supporting infrastructure costs related to planned hiring 

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income net of interest expense consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income net of interest expense was 166 million  161 million  and 159 million  in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively this increase was primarily due to the result of higher average cash balances offset by lower interest rates 

other income and expense 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation other expense net of other income was  28 million   10 million  and  05 million  in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively these changes were primarily driven by an increase in foreign currency translation losses 

   

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of  995 million   823 million  and  180 million  during fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 150  124  and 67  in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

our effective tax rate on income or loss before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35  due to income or loss earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35  favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonus jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits 

we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 16 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 excluding any discrete tax events that may occur which if realized may increase or decrease our effective tax rate in such quarter 

please refer to note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources   





as of january 27 2013  we had 373 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 5983 million  from the end of fiscal year 2012  our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration 

 operating activities 

  

operating activities generated cash of 8242 million  9092 million  and 6758 million  during fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012  primarily due to a decrease in net income and unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2012  for example accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and inventory increased as a result of the production ramp of keplerbased gpu products 

cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2011 for example accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and inventory decreased as a result of an increase in inventory turnover higher noncash charges in earnings including stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities 

 investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets investing activities used cash of  7440 million  11434 million  and  6497 million  during fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013 decreased by 3994 million  from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the acquisition of icera in fiscal year 2012 we used 1833 million  towards capital expenditures in fiscal year 2013  mainly for the purchase of new research and development equipment testing equipment to support our increased production requirements technology licenses software intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012 increased by 4937 million from fiscal year 2011 primarily due to the acquisition of icera in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and increased purchases of marketable securities during fiscal year 2012 additionally we used 1387 million towards capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 capital expenditures included purchase of new research and development equipment testing equipment to support our increased production requirements technology licenses software intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations 

  

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 153 million  during fiscal year 2013 and provided cash of  2367 million  and  1920 million  during fiscal years 2012  and 2011  respectively 

cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to our repurchase of 1000 million  of common stock and our firstever cash dividend payments of 469 million  these uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of 649 million  from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a noncash tax benefit of 687 million  related to employee stockbased compensation 

cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to cash proceeds of 1959 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a noncash tax benefit of 528 million related to employee stockbased compensation 

liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars as of january 27 2013  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities 

all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our statement of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

as of january 27 2013  and january 29 2012  we had  373 billion  and  313 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our investment policy requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration as specified in our investment policy guidelines these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument as of january 27 2013  we were in compliance with our investment policy as of january 27 2013  our investments in us government agencies and us government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 56  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 19  of our total investment portfolio all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy three  customers accounted for approximately 40  of our accounts receivable balance at january 27 2013  while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

 our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 27 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 180 billion held within the united states and 193 billion held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws as of january 27 2013 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 168 billion of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards further in addition to the 180 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where us income tax may otherwise be due accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition stock repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

 

we expect to spend approximately  2400 million  to  2800 million  for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2014 primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in fiscal year 2014 we expect to break ground on a new building for our headquarters campus in santa clara to provide for our nearterm growth needs this 500000 square foot building will provide 2500 seats and be built on land we purchased five years ago we estimate capital funding of 320 million for the campus development project in fiscal year 2014 in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ” 

  

  

product defect 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

during the three year period ended january 30 2011 we recorded a cumulative net charge of 4759 million most of which was charged against cost of revenue to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs if the actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 27 2013  and january 29 2012  we had 373 billion  and 313 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 27 2013  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

  

 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

  

as of january 27 2013  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately 204 million  

  

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 27 2013  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 56  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 19  of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately 49  123 million  

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  was 15 million  16  million and 24  million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

 we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 27 2013

our company 

nvidia is known to millions around the world for creating the graphics chips used in personal computers or pcs that bring games and home movies to life with the invention of the graphics processing unit or gpu we introduced the world to the power of computer graphics today we reach well beyond pc graphics our energyefficient processors power a broad range of products from smart phones to supercomputers our mobile processors are used in cell phones tablets and auto infotainment systems pc gamers rely on our gpus to enjoy visually immersive worlds designers use gpus to create visual effects in movies and create everything from golf clubs to jumbo jets researchers utilize gpus to push the frontiers of science with highperformance computing nvidia has nearly 5000 patents granted and pending worldwide 

  

nvidia solutions are based on two important technologies the gpu and the mobile processor both are highly complex chips designed by nvidia engineers and manufactured for us by a third party chip foundry gpus are the engines of visual computing the science and art of using computers to understand create and enhance images one of the most complex processors ever created the most advanced gpus contain billions of transistors we have three gpu product brands geforce which creates realistic visual experiences for gamers quadro the standard in visual computing for designers and digital artists and tesla which accelerates applications for scientists and researchers 

  

mobile processors incorporate central processing unit or cpu and gpu technologies to deliver an entire computer system on a single chip or systemonchip modern mobile processors possess significant computing capabilities yet consume one hundred times less energy than a typical pc tegra is our mobile processor and is built for applications ranging from smartphones tablets and notebook pcs to televisions and cars we believe energyefficient mobile computing will transform how computers are used in our lives tegra is a major new growth business for us 

we were incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 our headquarter facilities are in santa clara california 

reporting segments 

  

we have three primary financial reporting segments  gpu business professional solutions business or psb and consumer products business or cpb 



gpu business 

  

our gpu business revenue includes primarily sales of our geforce discrete and chipset products that support desktop and notebook pcs plus license fees from intel and sales of memory products geforce gpus enhance the gaming experience on consumer notebook and desktop pcs by improving the quality of game graphics and the physical realism of the game environment they also accelerate video editing and high definition or hd content creation by consumers and improve the viewing experience geforce gpus power pcs made by or distributed by most pc original equipment manufacturers or oems in the world 

we ceased development of future chipset products based on the technology of the media and communications processor or mcp in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and expect mcp chipset revenue in fiscal 2013 to be immaterial our mcp chipsets primarily comprised of our ion motherboard gpus a product reaching the end of its life cycle 

  

professional solutions business 

  

our psb consists of our quadro professional workstation products and our tesla highperformance computing products our quadro products are designed to deliver the highest possible level of graphics performance and application compatibility for professionals tesla applies the significant processing power of our gpus to generalpurpose computing problems greatly increasing performance and power efficiency over cpuonly solutions 

  

quadro products improve performance and add functionality such as photorealistic rendering to computeraided design workstations and are used in professional video editing applications and for generating special effects in movies they are recognized by many as the standard for professional graphics solutions needed to solve many of the worlds most complex visual computing challenges in the manufacturing entertainment medical science and aerospace industries quadro products are fully certified by several software developers for professional workstation applications 

  

our growth strategy for quadro is twofold increase our focus on emerging economies and continue to make quadro more valuable through innovations such as our maximus technology which allows professionals to process computeintensive tasks and visually intensive graphics simultaneously 

  

we believe industrial design is increasing in emerging economies as manufacturers in for example brazil russia india and china attempt to move up the value chain from contract manufacture to full product design moviemaking in these regions is becoming more sophisticated and is expected to make more use of quadro just as hollywood does today all five nominated films for the special effects oscar in 2011 used quadro while bollywoods first action blockbuster raone also depended on quadro for computergenerated special effects 

  

in fiscal year 2012 we launched project maximus which uses the compute power of tesla with the visualization power of quadro to merge the design and simulation stages into one workstation traditionally the design and simulation stages of new product development have been separate requiring the designer to hand over to a simulation expert and wait for the results before revising their design combining the processes greatly reduces the time for each iteration “simulation” in this context can mean verifying a plastic component is capable of manufacture by modeling the injection of molten plastic into a mold determining a product is strong enough through a stress simulation or generating a photorealistic image of a consumer product by simulating the path of light through and across it 

  

tesla has had particular success in supercomputing centers and in oil exploration other applications include accelerating drug discovery weather simulations and derivative price modeling our growth strategy for tesla is to focus on these and some other key markets and to continue building an ecosystem of applications development tools and developers who can develop for a massively parallel architecture like tesla 

  

consumer products business 

  

our cpb includes our tegra systemonchip products for smartphones tablets automotive infotainment systems and other similar devices and icera baseband processors the significant majority of tegra revenues are generated by sales in smart phones and tablets cpb also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices 

  

our mobile strategy is to create a systemonchip that enables the entertainment and web experiences that end users enjoy on a pc and other mobile devices nvidia tegra mobile products implement design techniques both inside the chips and at the system level which result in high performance and long battery life these technologies enhance visual display capabilities improve connectivity and minimize chip and systemlevel power consumption we aim to innovate faster than the competition introducing new features and capabilities to differentiate the user experience 

  

in support of this strategy during fiscal year 2012 we launched tegra 3 the worlds first quadcore mobile computing chip bringing pc levels of performance within the power envelope of a cellular phone chip tegra 3 includes several unique innovations including its variable symmetric multiprocessing architecture with companion core which enables extremely lowpower operation during the majority of use cases and prism which increases battery life during video playback by 40 another notable innovation is directtouch which significantly improves the responsiveness of touchscreen user interfaces on devices and simultaneously reduces costs for the device manufacturer our software expertise makes both of these inventions completely transparent to the operating system that is neither the operating system nor the application developer has to know about them for users to benefit from them 

during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 we completed the acquisition of icera an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets iceras technology uses a custombuilt lowpower processor and a softwarebased baseband which assist manufacturers to develop multiple products from a common platform reduce development costs and accelerate time to market iceras highspeed wireless modem products have been approved by more than 50 carriers across the globe in addition to leveraging on the existing icera business the objective of the acquisition is to accelerate and enhance the combination of our application processor with iceras baseband processor for use in mobile devices such as smartphone and tablets please refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information regarding this business combination 

  

our strategy 

maintain technology and product leadership in visual computing we believe that ongoing investment in research and development in 3d graphics and image processing is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies we are focused on using our advanced engineering capabilities to accelerate the quality and performance of 3d graphics image processing and computational graphics to raise and change the user experience for both consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus including gpus for highperformance computing and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams as we have in the past we intend to use this strategy to achieve new levels of graphics networking and communications features and performance and ultralow power designs enabling our customers to achieve superior performance in their products one of our primary competitive advantages is the quality of our software measured by performance reliability features and compatibility with other applications 

  

advance mobile computing with bestinclass ultralow power systemonchip processors we believe that our expertise in graphics and lowpower system architecture positions us to help drive continued market penetration through our applications processor roadmap by deploying the new nvidia icera baseband processor we believe we can address a larger segment of the phone market and further by integrating the applications processor and baseband processor together in a single product we believe we will be able to address an even larger segment next year 

revolutionize high performance computing with tesla and cuda tesla is a family of gpu computing products that delivers processing capabilities for highperformance computing applications nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the parallel compute engine in nvidia gpus to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required by a cpu we are working with developers around the world who have adopted and written application programs for the cuda architecture using various highlevel programming languages which can then be run at significant execution speeds on our gpus developers are able to accelerate algorithms in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing medical image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis we are also working with universities around the world that teach parallel programming with cuda as well as with many pc  or oems that offer high performance computing solutions with tesla for use by their customers around the world we also sell directly to supercomputing centers such as oak ridge national laboratory in the us and the national supercomputing center in tianjin china researchers use cuda to accelerate their timetodiscovery and many popular offtheshelf software packages are now cudaaccelerated 

  

use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts  we believe our technology leadership in graphics and mobile computing offers the opportunity to license our technology to customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products accordingly from time to time we expect to enter into license and development arrangements some of which may involve significant customization of our intellectual property components to further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology 

sales and marketing 

  

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of  highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile systemonchip products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

  

in the segments we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the cpb segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production 

  

as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 11  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012  

  

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

  

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

 our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand however there can be no assurance of this trend 

  

manufacturing 

  

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

  

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd siliconware precision industries company ltd and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from nanya technology corporation ibidenco ltd and unimicron technology corporation 

  

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

  

inventory and working capital 

  

our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

  

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 257  at the end of fiscal year 2012  compared with the end of fiscal year 2011  we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and systemonchip architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus including gpus for highperformance computing and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers 

  

as of january 29 2012  we had 5042  fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2012  2011 and 2010 we incurred research and development expense of  10026 million  8488 million and 9089 million respectively 

competition 

  

the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile and consumer products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include 

 

 

 

 

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds announcement of its fusion processors and intels announcement of its family of cpus codenamed sandy bridge as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from march 2012 to january 2031 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

  

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

  

  as of january 29 2012 we had 7133  employees 5042  of whom were engaged in research and development and 2091  of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

  

risks related to our business industry and partners 

if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impacted 

  

the market for our products is extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services 

our current competitors include 

  

 

 

 

   

we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do 

  

our ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability to 

  

   

if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer  

  

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from intel and amd both of whom has a strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds announcement of its fusion processors and intels announcement of its family of cpus codenamed sandy bridge as intel and amd continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus our business could be negatively impacted 

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

  

because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

  

  

if our thirdparty foundries are not able to transition to new manufacturing process technologies or develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies our operating results and gross margin could be adversely affected 

  

we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we believe this strategy will help us remain competitive our current product families are manufactured using 018 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer 80 nanometer 65 nanometer 55 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin 

  

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our thirdparty manufacturers to invest sufficient funds in new manufacturing processes in order to have ample capacity for all of their customers and to develop the processes in a timely manner our product cycles may also depend on our thirdparty manufacturers migrating to smaller geometry processes successfully and in time for us to meet our customer demands some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly or more successfully than our manufacturing partners if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted if we are forced to use larger geometric processes in manufacturing a product than our competition our gross margin may be reduced the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

  

we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacturer our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities will not develop such high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays if our thirdparty foundries fall behind our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted additionally we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will manufacture our products at prices that are competitive to what our competitors pay if our thirdparty foundries do not charge us competitive prices our operating results and gross margin will be negatively impacted 

  

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

  

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity and our recent transition to a wafer buy model where the costs of our products are based on the price per wafer versus price per functional die decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

 our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessful 

  

 in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner 

  

our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability to 

  

• effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets 

• timely complete and introduce new products and technologies 

• transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and 

• obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials 

  

we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

  

if we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed 

  

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets the market for our product and technologies has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions if we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will suffer 

  

additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results   

  

we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms and addin board or aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that we 

   

if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

  

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

  

if new consumer products and technologies which incorporate our products do not achieve market acceptance our business could be negatively impacted 

  

the success of our business also depends on market acceptance of new consumer products and technologies such as smartphones smartbooks tablets and other similar consumer electronics devices which contain our products as markets for these new consumer products emerge we may encounter new sources of competition as well as customers who have different requirements than those in the pc business if market acceptance of such products and technologies is not attained our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will be adversely affected 

  

our ability to be successful in emerging consumer product markets depends in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we will need to improve the functionality of our products to succeed in these new markets which may require significant time and resources on our part to design our products which could negatively impact our business 

  

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

  

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions climate change medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer 

  

in late july 2011 thailand began experiencing severe flooding that has caused widespread damage to the local manufacturing industry pc manufacturers obtain disk drive components used in its pcs from suppliers with operations in thailand that were and continue to be severely impacted by the flooding these pc manufacturers have and expect to continue to experience a shortterm reduction in the supply of these disk drive components as a result in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 shipments of pcs by some pc manufacturers were reduced which reduced the demand for our gpus in addition higher diskdrive prices constrained the ability of some pc manufacturers to include a gpu in their systems which also reduced demand for our gpus and negatively impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 

  

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

  

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communicationsand computerrelated industries within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden since pc cell phone and tablet manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

  

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

  

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue aggregated approximately 11 of our total revenue from one customer for the fiscal year 2012 and approximately 12 of our total revenue from another customer for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

  

   

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 

  

to achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels 

  

our past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

  

demand for many of our revenue components fluctuates and is difficult to predict and our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 352 326 and 383 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

  because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

  

we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

  

   

if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

  

global economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

 our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business as consumers and businesses have postponed spending in response to tighter credit negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which have reduced the demand for our products 

  

other factors that could depress demand for our products in the future include the european sovereign debt crisis conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets expectations for inflation labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior these and other economic factors have reduced demand for our products in the past and could further harm our business financial condition and operating results 

  

our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial results 

  

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

  

our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses 

  

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 

  

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities for example following our announcement in july 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation media and communication processor or mcp and gpu products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2009 the trading price of our common stock declined in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us relating to this announcement please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding these lawsuits due to changes in the potential volatility of our stock price we may be the target of securities litigation in the future such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   

  

our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

  

   

any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

  

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

  

we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business most recently we completed our acquisition of icera inc an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations product lines and technology of icera we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition which could adversely affect our business plans and operating results 

  

we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products our ability to sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

  

   

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted the significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

  

any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable including from foreign customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy we recorded approximately 20 and 11 of our accounts receivable balance from the same customer at january 29 2012 and january 30 2011 respectively 

  

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

we obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our accounts receivable there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk or avoid losses which could harm our financial condition or operating results 

  

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our business 

  

our future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our other key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

 in addition we rely on stockbased awards as a means for recruiting motivating and retaining highly skilled talent if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

  

 we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduce our control over the delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

  

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin and revenue to decline 

  

 we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

  

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

  

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

  

  if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

  

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant 

number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net warranty charges of 4664 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations and shipped after july 2008 please see the risk entitled “ we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business”  for further information regarding this product defect   

  

 we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

  

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase our engineering and technical resources included 5042 4161 and 3940 fulltime employees as of january 29 2012 january 30 2011 and january 31 2010 respectively research and development expenditures were 10026 million 8488 million and 9089 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

 we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

  

we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 78 83 and 84 of our revenue for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 29 2012 we had offices in 15 countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

  

   

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

  

our international operations in canada china hong kong finland france germany india japan korea russia singapore sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert managements attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable ways 

  

the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

  

our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 

  

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of january 29 2012 consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines designed to preserve principal minimize risk monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 

  

should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 29 2012 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired 

  

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

  

we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

  

as of january 29 2012 we recorded a total cumulative net warranty charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configuration the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs although we believe this issue has been nearly fully remediated we remain committed to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

  

we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products 

in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

  

we are a party to other litigation including patent litigation which if determined adversely to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

 we are a party to other litigation as both a defendant and as a plaintiff for example we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv of this form 10k for further details on this lawsuit there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business 

  

 currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration and as recently as on february 13 2012 with the release of the administrations fiscal year 2013 budget the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

  

   

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

  

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

  

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement 

  

an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

  

in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

  

   

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

 if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

  

   

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

    on september 16 2011 the leahysmith america invents act or the leahysmith act was signed into law the leahysmith act includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law these include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation the united states patent office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahysmith act and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahysmith act will not become effective until one year or 18 months after its enactment accordingly it is not clear what if any impact the leahysmith act will have on the operation of our business however the leahysmith act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

    

government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties and could result in litigation against us 

  

in the past we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the department of justice and the sec we may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future which may lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties 

  

in addition litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

  

   

expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

  

since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

  

we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1364 million 1004 million and 1071 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results 

  

to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

  

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

under us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

  

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 

  

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory 

  

there is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo new us legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products 

  

 future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation 

  

 while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer interim chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

  

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

  

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules or practices including the possible conversion to unified international accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

  

   

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

 3dfx 

  

 on december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below 

  

  

in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 70 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 50 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities 

  

 on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 108 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 108 million 

  

in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

  

 on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustees case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as “property” subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the “property” identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid “reasonably equivalent” to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

  

 on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction” this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidias favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court 

  

the district courts hearing on the trustees appeal was held on june 10 2009 on december 20 2010 the district court issued an order affirming the bankruptcy courts entry of summary judgment in nvidias favor on january 19 2011 the trustee filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit oral argument regarding the appeal is currently scheduled for may 15 2012 

  

 while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustees case still remains pending on appeal accordingly we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million  56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx  that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustees case

on july 10 2008 rambus inc filed suit against nvidia asserting patent infringement of 17 patents claimed to be owned by rambus rambus seeks damages enhanced damages and injunctive relief the lawsuit was filed in the northern district of california in san jose california on july 11 2008 nvidia filed suit against rambus in the middle district of north carolina asserting numerous claims including antitrust and other claims nvidia seeks damages enhanced damages and injunctive relief rambus has since dropped two patents from its lawsuit in the northern district of california the two cases have been consolidated into a single proceeding in the san francisco division of the northern district of california on april 13 2009 the court issued an order staying motion practice and allowing only certain document discovery to proceed on february 11 2011 the court lifted 

the stay and ordered that discovery on other issues could proceed the court has since opened motion practice and discovery with respect to ten patents referred to as the “farmwald” and “barth ii” patents most of the “farmwald” patents are also subject to patent reexamination requests the court has issued a scheduling order through the claim construction proceedings currently scheduled for april 23 and 24 2012 a case management conference is currently scheduled for may 18 2012 

  

on november 6 2008 rambus filed a complaint alleging a violation of 19 usc section 1337 based on a claim of patent infringement of nine rambus patents against nvidia and 14 other respondents with the us international trade commission or itc rambus has subsequently withdrawn four of the nine patents at issue the complaint sought an exclusion order barring the importation of products that allegedly infringe the now five rambus patents the itc instituted the investigation and a hearing was held october 1320 2009 the administrative law judge issued an initial determination on january 22 2010 which found the asserted claims of two patents in one patent family infringed but invalid and the asserted claims of three patents in a separate patent family valid infringed and enforceable this decision was reviewed by the itc the itc issued a final decision on july 26 2010 in its final decision the itc found that nvidia infringed three related patents and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting import of certain nvidia products nvidia is appealing certain aspects of the ruling that were unfavorable to nvidia rambus is also appealing certain aspects of the ruling that were unfavorable to rambus a hearing was held on october 6 2011 and a decision regarding the appeal has not yet been issued 

on may 13 2011 the federal circuit issued opinions in two related cases that address issues material to the disputes between rambus and certain other parties in the itc those opinions may positively affect nvidias defenses in all of the cases brought against nvidia by rambus in those opinions the federal circuit held rambus destroyed documents when it had a legal duty to preserve them and that if done in bad faith rambus is to bear the “heavy burden” to prove that nvidia suffered no prejudice in its ability to defend the cases brought against it by rambus in the itcs final decision despite finding rambus acted in bad faith the itc incorrectly placed the burden on nvidia to prove actual prejudice the federal circuit remanded both cases to the respective district courts for further proceedings consistent with its opinions those proceedings are currently underway 

  

nvidia also sought reexamination of the patents asserted in the itc as well as other patents in the united states patent and trademark office or uspto proceedings are underway with respect to all challenged patents with respect to the claims asserted in the itc the uspto has issued a preliminary ruling invalidating many of the claims the uspto issued right to appeal notices for the three patents found by the administrative law judge to be valid enforceable and infringed in the right to appeal notices the uspto examiner has cancelled all asserted claims of one of the patents and allowed the asserted claims on the other two patents rambus and nvidia both sought review of the uspto examiners adverse findings on appeal the board of patent appeals and interferences found the relevant claims of the three asserted “barth i” patents subject to reexamination invalid 

rambus has also been subject to an investigation in the european union nvidia was not a party to that investigation but has sought to intervene in the appeal of the investigation as a result of rambus commitments to resolve that investigation for a period of five years from the date of the resolution rambus must now provide a license to memory controller manufacturers sellers andor companies that integrate memory controllers into other products the license terms are set forth in a license made available on rambus website or the required rambus license on august 12 2010 we entered into the required rambus license pursuant to the agreement rambus charges a royalty of i one percent of the net sales price per unit for certain memory controllers and ii two percent of the net sales price per unit for certain other memory controllers provided that the maximum average net sales price per unit for these royalty bearing products shall be deemed not to exceed a maximum of 20 the agreement has a term until december 9 2014 however nvidia may terminate the agreement with thirty days prior written notice to rambus nvidia has already provided written notice to rambus of its intent to terminate effective immediately upon the removal of the itcs limited exclusion order 

  

on december 1 2010 rambus filed a lawsuit against nvidia and several other companies alleging six claims for patent infringement this lawsuit is pending in the northern district of california and seeks damages enhanced damages and injunctive relief on the same day rambus filed a complaint with the itc alleging that nvidia and several other companies violated 19 usc section 1337 based on a claim of patent infringement of three rambus patents rambus seeks exclusion of certain nvidia products from importation into the united states the northern district of california has stayed the case pending resolution of the itc investigation the asserted patents are related to each other and the three patents in the itc complaint are also at issue in the lawsuit pending in the northern district of california many of the patents at issue in these lawsuits are also being challenged in rambus other disputes with nvidia a hearing before an administrative law judge of the itc was held from october 1220 2011 and no ruling has been issued to date 

  

on february 7 2012 nvidia and rambus entered into a settlement agreement and a patent license agreement the two agreements resolve all disputes between nvidia and rambus the parties are in the process of dismissing all lawsuits appeals and itc actions to the maximum extent allowable by law

overview 

our company 

nvidia is known to millions around the world for creating the graphics chips that make their pc amazing when playing games or making home movies with the invention of the gpu we brought forth to the world the power of computer graphics today we reach well beyond pc graphics our energyefficient processors power a broad range of products from smart phones to supercomputers our mobile processors are used in cell phones tablets and auto infotainment systems pc gamers rely on our gpus to enjoy visually immersive worlds designers use them to create visual effects in movies and create everything from golf clubs to jumbo jets and researchers utilize gpus to push the frontiers of science with highperformance computing nvidia has nearly 5000 patents granted and pending worldwide including many inventions essential to modern computing 

  

nvidia solutions are based on two important technologies the gpu and the mobile processor both are highly complex chips designed by nvidia engineers and manufactured for us by a third party chip foundry gpus are the engines of visual computing a field that includes computer graphics image processing to computer vision visual computing is the science and art of using computers to understand create and enhance images one of the most complex processors ever created the most advanced gpus contain billions of transistors and require thousands of man years to create we have three gpu product brands geforce which creates amazing visual experiences for gamers quadro the standard in visual computing for designers and digital artists and tesla which accelerates applications for scientists and researchers 

  

mobile processors incorporate cpu and gpu technologies to deliver an entire computer system on a single chip or systemonchip modern mobile processors are remarkable in their computing capabilities yet consume a hundred times less energy than a typical pc tegra is our mobile processor and is built for applications ranging from smartphones tablets and notebook pcs to tvs and cars we believe energyefficient mobile computing will revolutionize how computers are used in our lives tegra is a major new growth business for us 

we were incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 our headquarter facilities are in santa clara california 

  

reporting segments 

  

we have three primary financial reporting segments  gpu business professional solutions business or psb and consumer products business or cpb 



  recent developments future objectives and challenges 

gpu business 

  

our geforce gpus power pcs made by or distributed by most pc original equipment manufacturers or oems in the world we launched over 30 gpus in fiscal year 2012we expect the release of our new kepler architecture to continue the growth in our gpu business the power efficiency of our kepler architecture provides a significant differentiator 

  

we ceased development of future chipset products based on the technology of the media and communications processor or mcp in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and expect mcp chipset revenue in fiscal 2013 to be immaterial our mcp chipsets primarily comprised of our ion motherboard gpus a product reaching the end of its life cycle 

  

professional solutions business 

in fiscal year 2012 we launched project maximus which uses the compute power of tesla with the visualization power of quadro to merge the design and simulation stages into one workstation traditionally the design and simulation stages of new product development have been separate requiring the designer to hand over to a simulation expert and wait for the results before revising their design combining the processes greatly reduces the time for each iteration “simulation” in this context can mean verifying a plastic component is capable of manufacture by modeling the injection of molten plastic into a mold determining a product is strong enough through a stress simulation or generating a photorealistic image of a consumer product by simulating the path of light through and across it 

there are now 35 computers in the top500 list of supercomputers based on tesla gpus up from 10 last year and oak ridge national labs announced in 2011 that titan its next supercomputer will be built with 18000 tesla gpus and is planned to be the worlds fastest computer when it goes live in 2012 at the gpu technology conference asia in december 2011 we announced that cuda our parallel programming architecture would be part of programming courses at 200 universities across china potentially generating up to 20000 additional tesla programmers every year 

  consumer products business 

  

during fiscal year 2012 we launched tegra 3 the worlds first quadcore mobile computing chip bringing pc levels of performance within the power envelope of a cellular phone chip tegra 3 includes several unique innovations including its variable symmetric multiprocessing architecture with companion core which enables extremely lowpower operation during the majority of use cases and prism which increases battery life during video playback by 40 another notable innovation is directtouch which significantly improves the responsiveness of touchscreen user interfaces on devices and simultaneously reduces costs for the device manufacturer our software expertise makes both of these inventions completely transparent to the operating system that is neither the operating system nor the application developer has to know about them for users to benefit from them 

  

tegra 3 is currently available to consumers in the asus transformer prime with additional products expected throughout calendar year 2012 tegra 3 phones have been announced by htc lg fujitsu zte and tianyu tegra 3 tablets have been announced from asus acer fujitsu lenovo toshiba and zte and we continue to work with a number of other device makers on tegra 3powered devices 

in addition zte the worlds fourthlargest cell phone manufacturer has announced the first phone to use an icera baseband processor the zte mimosa x uses tegra 2 and the icera i450 baseband processor to deliver superphone performance to the large and rapidly growing mainstream market in china 

during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 we completed the acquisition of icera an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets iceras technology uses a custombuilt lowpower processor and a softwarebased baseband which assist manufacturers to develop multiple products from a common platform reduce development costs and accelerate time to market iceras highspeed wireless modem products have been approved by more than 50 carriers across the globe in addition to leveraging on the existing icera business the objective of the acquisition is to accelerate and enhance the combination of our application processor with iceras baseband processor for use in mobile devices such as smartphone and tablets please refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information regarding this business combination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors or board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenue recognition 

  

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

  

our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense depending on the nature of the program mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment 

development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

license and development revenue 

  

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the of life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 

royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 

  

accounts receivable 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen such as the when the worldwide economy is experiencing a significant downturn the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the risk that financial institutions mighty consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a lower than normal level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from this type of credit crisis on our business including inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which could negatively impact our financial results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 

as of january 29 2012 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 09 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 3636 million of the 3636 million 848 million was covered by credit insurance and 124 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit we have incurred cumulative bad debts of 02 million over the last three fiscal years as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 03 during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 as of january 29 2012 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 03 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

  

inventories 

  

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our current inventory or future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted 

as of january 29 2012 our inventory reserve was 1101 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 150 and 306 during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 as of january 29 2012 our inventory reserve represented 244 of our gross inventory balance 

  

warranty liabilities 

cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

as of january 29 2012 we recorded a total cumulative net charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales general and administrative to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations included in the charge are the costs of implementing a settlement with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and other related estimated consumer class action settlements 

determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs however if actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

  as of january 29 2012 we had a valuation allowance of 2123 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

  

our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 5260 million as of january 29 2012 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

  

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 15  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information 

goodwill 

  

goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fair valuebased approach based on either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments or components of an operating segment for the purposes of completing our goodwill impairment test determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

effective the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we early adopted an accounting standard update commonly referred to the step zero approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing for those reporting units where significant change or event occurs and where potential impairment indicators exist we continue to utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities 

qualitative assessment 

in considering the step zero approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform a qualitative analysis evaluating factors including but not limited to macro economic conditions market and industry conditions competitive environment operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and budgetedtoactual revenue results 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we utilized a qualitative analysis for several reporting units where no significant change occurred and no potential impairment indicators existed since the previous annual evaluation of goodwill and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value on a reporting unit basis 

our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

quantitative assessment 

we utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for one reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30 this assessment was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and an analysis of market comparables 

our estimates of cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit determining the fair value of our reporting unit also requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables 

  

any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting unit reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit 

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

 cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholder’s equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we do not have any investment classified as level 3 as of january 29 2012  

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for 

availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  

 stockbased compensation 

  

our stockbased compensation cost for equity awards is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period we recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during the fiscal year ended january 29 2012  

  



  

 accounting standards also require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

  

 our stockbased compensation expense for employee stock purchase plan is recognized using an accelerated amortization method we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year ended january 29 2012  using the following assumptions 

  



  

  litigation investigation and settlement costs 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with usgaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 



fiscal years ended january 29 2012 january 30 2011and january 31 2010 

  

revenue 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

  

revenue was 400 billion  for fiscal year 2012  and 354 billion  for fiscal year 2011  an increase of 128  a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue was 254 billion  for fiscal year 2012  compared to 252 billion for fiscal year 2011  the increase is primarily attributable to revenue from the cross licensing agreement with intel and increased desktop and notebook product revenue the increase in desktop and notebook revenues came from continued market penetration of our fermi architecture based gpus strength of our fermi architecture and resultant wins on the sandy bridge platform contributed to increase in notebook revenues offsetting these increases were decreases in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line additionally memory sales also decreased due to lower sales volume as decreases in market price for memory made it attractive for addin card manufacturers to buy memory directly from market rather than from us 

psb  psb revenue increased by 56  to 8643 million  for fiscal year 2012  as compared to 8186 million  for fiscal year 2011  the average selling price or asp for workstation products improved due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 offsetting this was a decrease in our tesla product revenues from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 1992  to 5912 million  for fiscal year 2012  as compared to 1976 million  for fiscal year 2011  this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from the acceleration of our tegra 2 smartphone and tablet products in the mobile market and in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products remained stable in fiscal year 2012  when compared to fiscal year 2011  

fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

  

revenue was 354 billion for fiscal year 2011 and 333 billion for fiscal year 2010 an increase of 7 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue decreased by 5 to 252 billion for fiscal year 2011 compared to 266 billion for fiscal year 2010 the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line also sales of mainstream desktop gpu decreased as a result of lower unit shipments driven by weakness in our end customer markets related to unstable economic conditions and increased competition in the lowerend market segments offsetting these declines were increases in sales of our notebook gpu highend desktop gpu and memory products the growth in sales of notebook gpu products was driven by a continuing shift in the market demand towards notebook pcs from desktop pcs as reported in the december 2010 pc graphics report from mercury research the growth in memory sales and highend desktop gpu products was driven primarily by the launch of our new generation of gpus with fermi architecture 

psb  psb revenue increased by 60 to 8186 million for fiscal year 2011 as compared to 5100 million for fiscal year 2010 both the asp and unit shipments of professional workstation products increased due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 in addition we saw strong growth in our tesla products from the prior year as our high performance computing line gained traction fueled by the fermi architecture release 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 27 to 1976 million for fiscal year 2011 as compared to 1560 million for fiscal year 2010 this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from ramp up in our tegra 2 products offset by decreases in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products increased slightly in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 

concentration of revenue 

  

we generated 78  83 and 84 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2012  2011 and 2010 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 



  

gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

  

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 514  398 and 354 for fiscal years 2012  2011 and 2010 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 

our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix however we may experience difficulties in the transition to new manufacturing processes we expect gross margin to decrease within the range of 482 to 502 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 primarily driven by our transition to 28nm technology and transition to a wafer buy model where the costs of our products are based on the price per wafer versus price per functional die 

 a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

our gross margin increased to 514  in fiscal year 2012  from 398  in fiscal year 2011  the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily due to increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our desktop gpu and notebook geforce gpu products and workstation products and the addition of revenue in the current year from the cross licensing arrangement with intel manufacturing cost efficiencies and strong management of inventory also helped margin improve in the current fiscal year other favorable impacts to gross margin were the absence in fiscal year 2012 of a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of 1812 million recorded in fiscal year 2011 related to a weak diepacking material set and lower provisions for net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 18 and 19 in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 and 30 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2011 

  gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2012  when compared to fiscal year 2011 this was primarily due to lower provisions for net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak diepackaging material set recorded in fiscal year 2011 revenue from our cross licensing arrangement with intel also contributed to gross margin increase in addition higher unit sales and richer product mix of our desktop and notebook geforce gpu products also improved gross margin for the gpu business 

psb  the gross margin of our psb remained stable during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 for both quadro and tesla products 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease was a result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of revenue from higher margin products and services such as development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products and a higher mix of revenue from our tegra products which grew substantially during the year 

  

fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

our gross margin increased to 398 in fiscal year 2011 from 354 for fiscal year 2010 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily due to increased unit sales mix and better asps of our highend desktop gpu notebook gpu and workstation products cost efficiencies and pricing decisions also helped margin improve in the current fiscal year additionally fiscal year 2010 included 114 million charge related to the our tender offer to purchase certain stock options for personnel related to manufacturing which resulted in an adverse impact on gross margins that did not occur in fiscal year 2011 

offsetting these favorable impacts we recorded a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of 1812 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to 959 million in fiscal year 2010 related to a weak diepacking material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 19 and 16 in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 30 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2011 and a 02 favorable impact in fiscal year 2010 

  

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business remained comparable during fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 while higher inventory reserves due to future demand concerns in the first half of fiscal year 2011 and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak diepackaging material set reduced gross margin for fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 this was more than offset by higher unit sales mix and asps in the highend desktop and notebook product lines 

psb  the gross margin of our psb remained flat during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 improvements in gross margin as a result of better asps and shipment volumes in our quadro product line were offset by higher inventory reserves recorded in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 tesla gross margin improved due to better production efficiencies was driven by lower product cost and higher unit sales while asps remained stable 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 this increase was a result of better asps and higher unit shipment of our tegra products as well as slightly better revenue from higher margin products and services including development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

     operating expenses   



  

research and development 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

research and development expenses increased by 1538 million  or 181  year over year compensation and benefits increased by 837 million primarily related to growth in headcount stock based compensation increased by 225 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in headcount a higher average fair value for the awards that were granted during the year and higher expense from the employee stock purchase program development expenses increased by 90 million related to the ramp of our nextgeneration gpu architecture kepler designed for 28nm technology and our next generation mobile computing architecture tegra 3 depreciation and amortization increased by 88 million driven primarily by amortization of new licenses acquired during the year also contributing to the increase were other acquisitionrelated costs of 124 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we have established for employees from our acquisition of icera in june 2011 and 60 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition 

fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

research and development expenses decreased by 601 million or 66 the majority of the decrease was caused by stockbased compensation charges recorded during fiscal year 2010 of 905 million related to a tender offer that closed in march 2009 depreciation and amortization decreased by 89 million due to assets being fully depreciated these decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of 235 million primarily due to growth in headcount and an increase of 76 million for development expenses 

sales general and administrative 

fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 

 sales general and administrative expenses increased by  441 million  or 122  year over year compensation and benefits increased by 295 million primarily attributable to headcount growth stockbased compensation increased by 105 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in headcount a higher average fair value for the awards that were granted during the year and higher expense from the employee stock purchase program also contributing to the increase were 44 million for transaction costs related to the acquisition of icera inc 35 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we have established for employees from the icera acquisition and 22 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 40 million due to lower litigationrelated costs in the current year and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 92 million due to certain software and lease hold improvements of headquarters buildings that became fully depreciated during the year 

fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

sales general and administrative expenses decreased by 55 million or 15 the majority of the decrease was caused by stockbased compensation charges recorded during fiscal year 2010 of 383 million related to a tender offer that closed in march 2009 professional fees decreased by 106 million due to decreased legal service charges depreciation and amortization decreased by 42 million due to assets being fully depreciated offsetting these decreases was an increase in compensation and benefits of 281 million primarily attributable to growth in headcount we had increases across discretionary spending areas such as 57 million for marketing 32 million for contract labor and 29 million for travel and entertainment to meet the increasing opportunities of our business as the economy recovers our expenses also increased by 150 million related to the settlement of the nvidia gpu litigation case described in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

 legal settlement 

  

on january 10 2011 we entered into a sixyear cross licensing agreement with intel and also mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes the fair valued benefit prescribed to the legal settlement portion was 570 million and was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 

we expect operating expenses to be approximately 383 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income net of interest expense consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income net of interest expense increased to 161 million  in fiscal year 2012  from 159 million  in fiscal year 2011  primarily due to the result of higher average cash balances offset by lower interest rates interest income net of interest expense decreased to 159 million  in fiscal year 2011  from 198 million  in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to the result of lower interest rates on our investments 

other income expense net 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation other expense net of other income was  10 million   05 million  and  31 million  in fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the fluctuation between these years was primarily due to other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the reserve international liquidity fund ltd that resulted in a charge of 56 million in fiscal year 2009 which was partially recovered in fiscal year 2011 for a gain of 30 million resulting from the final disbursement of this fund 

  

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense benefit of  823 million   180 million  and  143 million  during fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively income tax expense benefit as a percentage of income loss before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 124 in fiscal year 2012  67 in fiscal year 2011  and 174 in fiscal year 2010  

our effective tax rate on income or loss before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35  due to income or loss earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35  favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonus jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits 

we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 excluding any discrete tax events that may occur which if realized may increase or decrease our effective tax rate in such quarter 

please refer to note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

  





as of january 29 2012  we had 313 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 6390 million  from the end of fiscal year 2011  our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration 

 operating activities 

  

operating activities generated cash of 9092 million  6758 million  and 4878 million  during fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

the cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2012  when compared to fiscal year 2011  primarily due to an increase in our net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2011  for example accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and inventory decreased as a result of an increase in inventory turnover higher noncash charges in earnings including stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 

the cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to an increase in our net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2010 for example accounts receivable decreased due to improved sales linearity and stronger collections during the year while accrued and other liabilities increased primarily due to an additional net charge for incremental repair and replacement costs from a weak diepackaging material set higher noncash charges in earnings including stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities

liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars as of january 29 2012  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities 

all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our statement of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax

enterprises represented approximately 51  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 24  of our total investment portfolio all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy two customers accounted for approximately 27  of our accounts receivable balance at january 29 2012  while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 29 2012 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 123 billion held within the united states and 190 billion held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws as of january 29 2012 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 129 billion of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards further in addition to the 123 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where us income tax may otherwise be due accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material impact on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states

stock repurchase program 

  

our board of directors has authorized us subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of 27 billion through may 2013 the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

  

we did not enter into any structured share repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal year ended january 29 2012  through january 29 2012  we have repurchased an aggregate of 909 million  shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 146 billion  as of january 29 2012  we are authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to 124 billion through may 2013 

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

 

we expect to spend approximately  1400 million  to  1800 million  for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2013  primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ” 

  

  product defect 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

as of january 29 2012 we recorded a total cumulative net charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales general and administrative to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products and used in notebook configurations included in the charge are the costs of implementing a settlement with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and other related estimated consumer class action settlements 

  

the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 29 2012  and january 30 2011  we had 313 billion  and 249 billion  respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 29 2012  we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

  

 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

  

as of january 29 2012  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately 137 million  

  

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 29 2012  our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 51  of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 24  of our total investment portfolio of the financial sector investments over half are guaranteed by the us government substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately 43  107 million  

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  was 16 million  24  million and 09  million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive 

which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

 we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 29 2012

  use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts from time to time we expect to enter into license and royalty arrangements that may require significant customization of our intellectual property components 

sales and marketing 

  

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of programmable highperformance gpus and ultralow power mobile systemonachip products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

  

in the segments we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the cpb segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders 

  

although as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer quanta computer incorporated accounted for 12 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2011 

  

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

  

 

backlog 

  

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

  

  our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand while we anticipate that this historical seasonal trend will resume there can be no assurance of this trend for example revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2011 decreased by 5 compared with the first half of fiscal year 2011 primarily due to weakness in end consumer markets while revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2010 grew by 31 compared with the first half of fiscal year 2010 

manufacturing 

  

fabless manufacturing strategy 

  

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

  

  we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc and united microelectronics corporation or umc to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd siliconware precision industries company ltd and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from nanya technology corporation ibidenco ltd and unimicron technology corporation 

  

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

  

inventory and working capital 

  

our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

  

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 44 at the end of fiscal year 2011 compared with the end of fiscal year 2010 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

  

 

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and systemonchip architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus including gpus for highperformance computing and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

  

as of january 30 2011 we had 4161 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we incurred research and development expense of 8488 million 9089 million and 8559 million respectively 

competition 

  

  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces or apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

  

  a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile and consumer products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

  if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processors and intel’s announcement of its family of cpus codenamed sandy bridge if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

  

  

  

 

 

  

patents and proprietary rights 

 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 5th 2011 to january 29 2031 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

  

  as of january 30 2011 we had 6029 employees 4161 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1868 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions we believe our relationships with our employees are good

available information 

  

  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act are available free of charge on or through our web site httpwwwnvidiacom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission or the sec our web site and the information on it or connected to it is not a part of this form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

  in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

  

  risks related to our business industry and partners 

  

  our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessful 

  

  in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technology trends could significantly harm our market we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner 

  

  our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability to 

 

 

 

 

we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

if we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed 

  

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets the market for our product and technologies has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions if we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will suffer 

  

  

additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results   

we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems or odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers’ new system configurations this requires that we 

  

 

 

 

 

  

if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers’ product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

  if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impacted 

  

the market for our products specifically the gpu and mobile and consumer markets are extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services our current competitors include the following some of which have greater financial technical and management resources than us 

 

 

 

 

  

we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do 

our ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer  

  

 

 

we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd is also shipping a platform solution additionally intel and amd have each announced its intention to integrate a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project and intel’s introduction of sandy bridge products if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

  if new consumer products and technologies which incorporate our products do not achieve market acceptance our business could be negatively impacted 

 

the success of our business also depends on market acceptance of new consumer products and technologies such as smartphones smartbooks tablets and other similar consumer electronics devices which contain our products as markets for these new consumer products emerge we may encounter new sources of competition as well as customers who have different requirements than those in the pc business if market acceptance of such products and technologies is not attained our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will be adversely affected 

 

our ability to be successful in emerging consumer product markets depends in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we will need to improve the functionality of our products to succeed in these new markets which may require significant time and resources on our part to design our products which could negatively impact our business 

 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

  

we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers aggregate sales to customers in excess of 10 of total revenue for fiscal year 2011 was 12 from one customer aggregate sales to customers in excess of 10 were approximately 12 of our total revenue from one customer for fiscal year 2010 sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products   in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because 

 

 

 

 

the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 

to achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels 

our past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

  

  

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

  

because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

if our thirdparty foundries are not able to transition to new manufacturing process technologies or develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies our operating results and gross margin could be adversely affected 

  

we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we believe this strategy will help us remain competitive our current product families are manufactured using 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer 65 nanometer 55 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin 

  

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our thirdparty manufacturers to invest sufficient funds in new manufacturing processes in order to have ample capacity for all of their customers and to develop the processes in a timely manner our product cycles may also depend on our thirdparty manufacturers migrating to smaller geometry processes successfully and in time for us to meet our customer demands some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly or more successfully than our manufacturing partners if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted if we are forced to use larger geometric processes in manufacturing a product than our competition our gross margin may be reduced the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

  

we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacturer our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities will not develop such high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier if our third partyfoundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays if our thirdparty foundries fall behind our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted additionally we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will manufacture our products at a price that is competitive to what our competitors pay if our thirdparty foundries do not charge us a competitive price our operating results and gross margin will be negatively impacted 

  

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

  

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

  

  

  

global economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business as consumers and businesses have postponed spending in response to tighter credit negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which have reduced the demand for our products 

 

other factors that could depress demand for our products in the future include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets expectations for inflation labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior these and other economic factors have reduced demand for our products in the past and could further harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have and may in the future harm our business and financial results 

  

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products our third party manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

  

  

 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

  

we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

 

  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

 

demand for many of our revenue components fluctuates and is difficult to predict and our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 33 and 38 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

  

any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable including from foreign customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

  our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy we recorded approximately 17 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers at january 30 2011 

  

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

we obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our accounts receivable there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk or avoid losses which could harm our financial condition or operating results 

  

  

  

  we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our business 

 

our future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our other key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

  in addition we rely on stockbased awards as a means for recruiting motivating and retaining highly skilled talent if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

  

  we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduce our control over the delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

  

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co siliconware precision industries co ltd and chippac as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin and revenue to decline 

  

  we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

  

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

  

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

  

  we are dependent on the personal computer market and its rate of growth in the future may have a negative impact on our business 

  

we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop personal computer or pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products these changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

  

  

  

 

  if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net warranty charges of 4664 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configurations please see the risk entitled “ we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business” for further information regarding this product defect   

  

  we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase our engineering and technical resources included 4161fulltime employees as of january 30 2011 3940 employees as of january 31 2010 and 3772 employees as of january 25 2009 respectively research and development expenditures were 8488 million 9089 million and 8559 million for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively research and development expenses included stockbased compensation expense of 579 million 1518 million and 980 million for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively also included in research and development expense for fiscal year 2010 is stockbased compensation of 905 million related to the purchase of certain outstanding options that were tendered in march 2009 if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

 

  we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

  

we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 83 84 and 87 of our revenue for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 30 2011 we have offices in 16 countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

  

  

  

  

our international operations in australia china finland france germany hong kong india japan korea russia singapore sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

  

  conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and manufacturers may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 

  

  the economic market social and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and manufacturers are located are unpredictable can be volatile and can have a significant impact on our business because we may be unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner market and political conditions including currency fluctuation terrorism political strife war labor disruption and other factors including climate change natural or manmade disasters adverse changes in tax laws tariff import or export quotas power and water shortages or interruption in air transportation in areas where our independent subcontractors and manufacturers are located could also have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities for example because we rely heavily on tsmc to produce a significant portion of our silicon wafers earthquakes typhoons or other natural disasters in taiwan and asia could limit our wafer supply and thereby harm our business financial condition and operational results 

  

  we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

  

  we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management’s attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products our ability to sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted the significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

  

  

  

 

 

our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 

  

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of january 30 2011 consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines designed to preserve principal minimize risk monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 

should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 30 2011 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired 

  

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

  

we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

  

during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded cumulative net warranty charges of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configurations the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

  

we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products 

  

in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are a party to other litigation including patent litigation which if determined adversely to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

  we are a party to other litigation as both a defendant and as a plaintiff for example we are engaged in litigation with rambus inc and with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 please refer to note 13 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further detail on these lawsuits there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

  

  

 

  changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obama’s administration and as recently as on february 14 2011 with the release of the administration’s fiscal year 2012 budget the white house has proposed various international tax legislation some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

  

 

  

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

        

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

  

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement 

  

an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

  

in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

  

 

 

 

 

  

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

  if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties’ patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  

 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

    

government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties and could result in litigation against us 

  

in the past we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the department of justice and the sec we may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future which may lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties 

  

in addition litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

  

since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

  

we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1004 million 1071 million and 1627 million for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results additionally in march 2009 we completed a cash tender offer to purchase certain employee stock options a total of 285 million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of 781 million in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options as a result of the tender offer we incurred a charge of 1402 million consisting of the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees we believe that expensing employee equity compensation will continue to negatively impact our operating results 

  

to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

under us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

  

our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses 

  

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance 

  

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities for example following our announcement in july 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2009 the trading price of our common stock declined in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us relating to this announcement please refer to note 13 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding these lawsuits due to changes in the potential volatility of our stock price we may be the target of securities litigation in the future such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   

  

  

  

  our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory 

there is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo new us legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products 

  

future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation 

  

  while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies’ internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

  

  changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

  

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules or practices including the possible conversion to unified international accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

  

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3  legal proceedings 

  

3dfx 

  

on december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfx’s october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfx’s former landlords one by 3dfx’s bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfx’s equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10k the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below 

  

in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustee’s fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfx’s assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 70 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 50 million the trustee’s successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfx’s legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfx’s unpaid liabilities 

  

on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 108 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustee’s request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 108 million 

in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustee’s constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as “property” subject to the bankruptcy court’s avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the “property” identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid “reasonably equivalent” to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties’ contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction” this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustee’s action however as the trustee’s claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidia’s favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court 

the district court’s hearing on the trustee’s appeal was held on june 10 2009 on december 20 2010 the district court issued an order affirming the bankruptcy court’s entry of summary judgment in nvidia’s favor on january 19 2011 the trustee filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 

while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustee’s case still remains pending on appeal accordingly we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million – 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx – that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee’s case

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1a risk factors” “item 6 selected financial data” our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase hold or sell shares of our common stock 

  

overview 

  

  our company 

nvidia corporation invented the graphics processing unit or gpu in 1999 since then we have strived to set new standards in visual computing with interactive graphics available on devices ranging from tablets and smart phones to notebooks and workstations our expertise in programmable gpus and computersystems technology has led to breakthroughs in parallel processing which make supercomputing inexpensive and widely accessible we are strategically investing in three major areas – visual computing high performance computing and mobile computing we serve the visual computing market with our consumer geforce graphics products and professional quadro graphics products the high performance computing market with our tesla computing solutions products and the mobile computing market with our tegra systemonchip products 

we have three primary financial reporting segments – gpu professional solutions business or psb and consumer products business or cpb during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we operated and reported four major productline operating segments the gpu business the psb business the media and communications processor or mcp business and the cpb business however during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we began reporting internally the results of our former mcp segment along with the results of our gpu segment to reflect the way we manage the gpu business comparative periods presented reflect this change 

our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce discrete and chipset products which support desktop and notebook personal computers or pcs plus memory products our psb is comprised of our quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products including our nvidia tesla highperformance computing products our cpb is comprised of our tegra mobile products which support tablets smartphones personal media players or pmps internet television automotive navigation and other similar devices cpb also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addincard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies worldwide utilize our processors as a core component of their entertainment business and professional solutions 

  

we were incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 our headquarter facilities are in santa clara california our web address is wwwnvidiacom  the contents of our website are not a part of this form 10k 

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

  

gpu business 

during fiscal year 2011 we took the computational capabilities of our gpus to a new level with the launch of our fermi architecture fermi gpus are designed to excel at tessellation the key feature of directx 11 and to allow game developers to increase the level of physics realism via our physx api our flagship product for the desktop the geforce gtx 480 was followed by a complete lineup of 400series gpus later in the year we refreshed them with our 500series gpus which significantly increased the performance of the products they replaced while fitting into similar power envelopes we also launched 400m and 500mseries gpus for notebooks along with our optimus technology which switches invisibly between discrete gpu and integrated graphics controller depending on the user’s activities by doing so nvidia optimus provides notebook users with the battery life of integrated graphics but with the gaming performance of a discrete graphics processor pc manufacturers also are expected to launch hundreds of new pcs that use these new geforce gpus paired with intel corporation’s sandy bridge cpus 

 

  during fiscal year 2011 we also announced our plans to develop a custom central processing unit or cpu that will use the arm instruction set these cpu cores will be integrated into future generation gpus for pcs servers and supercomputers   

 

  

  

  

 

  professional solutions business 

  during fiscal year 2011 our quadro business benefitted from the strength of our fermi architecture with the launch of the quadro 2000 midrange gpu and the quadro 600 entrylevel gpu these professional graphics solutions put the computational and visualization benefits of our fermi architecture within reach of all engineers designers and animators with the quadro 2000 delivering significantly higher performance across leading cad applications and the quadro 600 positioned at a competitive priceperformance point the new quadro gpus deliver performance that is up to five times faster for 3d applications and up to eight times faster for computational simulation than our previous quadro generation products 

  our tesla supercomputing business continued to make progress with key project wins not only in our core market segments but also with traction in a number of new focus areas 

  

  consumer products business 

  during fiscal year 2011 we saw promising signs in our tegra business helped by adoption to the android operating system tegra shipment volumes began to ramp up late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and we expect the momentum to continue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 fueled by the production release of androidbased smartphone and tablet products during the fiscal year 2011 we had multiple tegra 2 design wins in both tablets and smartphones our customers including acer inc dell inc lg electronics inc and motorola solutions inc announced a number of products incorporating the tegra 2 mobile processor we also demonstrated our nextgeneration mobile processor the world’s first quadcore mobile processor at mobile world congress 

  during fiscal year 2011 we announced that volkswagen ag and audi ag will use our nextgeneration tegra starting in 2012 in addition we announced that bmw group will use our gpus for infotainment systems in nextgeneration cars worldwide tesla motors will also incorporate tegra processors to power the infotainment navigation and instrument cluster in its roadster model s 

  patent cross license agreement 

 

on january 10 2011 we entered into a new sixyear patent cross licensing agreement or the license agreement with intel under the license agreement intel has granted to nvidia and its qualified subsidiaries and nvidia has granted to intel and intel’s qualified subsidiaries a nonexclusive nontransferable worldwide license without the right to sublicense to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first filing date on or before march 31 2017 to make have made subject to certain limitations use sell offer to sell import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor and electronicrelated products anywhere in the world nvidia’s rights to intel’s patents have certain specified limitations including but not limited to nvidia was not granted a license to 1 certain microprocessors defined in the license agreement as “intel processors” or “intel compatible processors” 2 certain chipsets that connect to intel processors or 3 certain flash memory products in connection with the license agreement nvidia and intel mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes under the license agreement intel will pay nvidia an aggregate amount of 15 billion payable in annual installments as follows a 300 million payment on each of january 18 2011 january 13 2012 and january 15 2013 and a 200 million payment on each of january 15 2014 2015 and 2016 

the license agreement between nvidia and intel includes multiple elements as a result we determined each element of the license agreement their fair value and when they should be recognized the elements of the license agreement are accounted for as follows 

  

 

  

please refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this cross license and the settlement 

  

  

 

product defect 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

  during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations the net charge amounted to 1939 million of which 1812 million was charged against cost of revenue the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and the other estimated consumer class action settlement as a result of this settlement the other related estimated settlement and offsetting insurance reimbursements we recorded a net charge of 127 million to sales general and administrative expense during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 together with the 2820 million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs this brings the total cumulative net charge to 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales general and administrative expenses 

  

the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 

  in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation and the settlement   

  

tender offer 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than 1750 per share none of the nonemployee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section 16a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including our former chief financial officer marvin d burkett were eligible to participate in the offer all eligible options with exercise prices less than 2800 per share but not less than 1750 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 300 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option all eligible options with exercise prices greater than 2800 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 200 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 

  

  

  

 

a total of 285 million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of 781 million which was paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options as a result of the tender offer we incurred a charge during fiscal year 2010 of 1402 million consisting of 1241 million related to the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer 116 million related to stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options plus 45 million related to associated payroll taxes professional fees and other costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors or board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenue recognition 

  

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

  

our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 

  

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense depending on the nature of the program mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

  

  

  

  license and development revenue 

  

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

    royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 

 

accounts receivable 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen such as the when the worldwide economy is experiencing a significant downturn the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the risk that financial institutions mighty consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a lower than normal level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from this type of credit crisis on our business including inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which could negatively impact our financial results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 

as of january 30 2011 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 08 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 3865 million of the 3865 million 860 million was covered by credit insurance and 44 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit we have incurred cumulative bad debts of 05 million over the last three fiscal years as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 03 during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively as of january 30 2011 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

  

inventories 

  

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted 

  

 

 

as of january 30 2011 our inventory reserve was 1520 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 150 and 306 during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 as of january 30 2011 our inventory reserve represented 306 of our gross inventory balance 

  

warranty liabilities 

cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

during fiscal year 2011 we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations the net charge amounted to 1939 million of which 1812 million was charged against cost of revenue the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during fiscal year 2011 with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and another related estimated consumer class action settlement as a result of this settlement the other estimated settlement and offsetting insurance reimbursements we recorded a net charge of 127 million to sales general and administrative expense during fiscal year 2011 together with the 2820 million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs this brings the total cumulative net charge to 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales general and administrative 

determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs however if actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

income taxes 

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

  

  

  

  as of january 30 2011 we had a valuation allowance of 1480 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period the realization occurred 

  

our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 5652 million as of january 30 2011 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

  

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information 

  

goodwill 

  

our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments or components of an operating segment for the purposes of completing our goodwill impairment test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fair valuebased approach 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 our market capitalization increased over 60 when compared to the same period in fiscal year 2010 we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value this assessment was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis analysis of market comparables where appropriate and analysis of our market capitalization determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

  

our estimates of cash flows were based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of some or all of our reporting units determining the fair value of our reporting units also requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables if there are any and the amount of weight to ascribe to fair value measurements that are based on the market approach 

any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with some or all of our reporting units 

  

  

  

  

cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

  cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholder’s equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs as of january 30 2011 we collected the balance of our investment in the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund that was classified as a level 3 input due to the inherent subjectivity and the significant judgment involved in its valuation as such we do not have any investment classified as level 3 as of january 30 2011 

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  

  stockbased compensation 

  

  our stockbased compensation cost for equity awards is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period we recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during the fiscal year ended january 30 2011 

  

 

 

  accounting standards also require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with usgaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs

revenue 

fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

  

  revenue was 354 billion for the fiscal year 2011 and 333 billion for fiscal year 2010 an increase of 7 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we expect revenue to grow by six to eight percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue decreased by 5 to 252 billion for fiscal year 2011 compared to 266 billion for fiscal year 2010 the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line also sales of mainstream desktop gpu decreased as a result of lower unit shipments driven by weakness in our end customer markets related to unstable economic conditions and increased competition in the lowerend market segments offsetting these declines were increases in sales of our notebook gpu highend desktop gpu and memory products the growth in sales of notebook gpu products was driven by a continuing shift in the market demand towards notebook pcs from desktop pcs as reported in the december 2010 pc graphics report from mercury research the growth in memory sales and highend desktop gpu products was driven primarily by the launch of our new generation of gpus with fermi architecture 

psb  psb revenue increased by 60 to 8186 million for the fiscal year 2011 as compared to 5100 million for fiscal year 2010 both the average selling price or asp and unit shipments of professional workstation products increased due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 in addition we saw strong growth in our tesla products from the prior year as our high performance computing line gained traction fueled by the fermi architecture release 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 27 to 1976 million for fiscal year 2011 as compared to 1560 million for fiscal year 2010 this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from ramp up in our tegra 2 products offset by decreases in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products increased slightly in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 

  

  

  

  

    fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009 

  

  revenue was 333 billion for the fiscal year 2010 and 342 billion for fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 3 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 3 to 266 billion for fiscal year 2010 compared to 259 billion for fiscal year 2009 the increase was primarily driven by sales of our ion products this was offset by a decrease in sales of our notebook gpus driven primarily by a combination of a decline in unit demand and a decline in asp as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and due to share losses we experienced within the notebook segment during calendar year 2009 compared to calendar year 2008 as reported in the november pc graphics 2009 report from mercury research 

psb  psb revenue decreased by 26 to 5102 million for the fiscal year 2010 as compared to 6934 million for fiscal year 2009 both the asps and unit shipments of professional workstation products decreased primarily due to the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 

 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 15 to 1560 million for fiscal year 2010 as compared to 1363 million for fiscal year 2009 this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from our embedded products for the automotive and entertainment markets and was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

    concentration of revenue 

  

we generated 83 84 and 87 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers or cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 

 

  

  gross profit and gross margin 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

  

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 398 354 and 343 for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 

our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix we expect gross margin to be in the range of 485 to 495 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 

  

  

  a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

  

  fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010 

our gross margin increased to 398 in fiscal year 2011 from 354 for fiscal year 2010 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily due to increased unit sales mix and better asps of our highend desktop gpu notebook gpu and workstation products cost efficiencies and pricing decisions also helped margin improve in the current fiscal year additionally fiscal year 2010 included 114 million charge related to the company’s tender offer to purchase certain stock options for personnel related to manufacturing which resulted in an adverse impact on gross margins that did not occur in fiscal year 2011 

offsetting these favorable impacts we recorded a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of 1812 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to 959 million in fiscal year 2010 related to a weak diepacking material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 19 and 16 in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 30 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2011 and a 02 favorable impact in fiscal year 2010 

 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business remained comparable during fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 while higher inventory reserves due to future demand concerns in the first half of fiscal year 2011 and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak diepackaging material set reduced gross margin for fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 this was more than offset by higher unit sales mix and asps in the highend desktop and notebook product lines 

psb  the gross margin of our psb remained flat during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 improvements in gross margin as a result of better asps and shipment volumes in our quadro product line were offset by higher inventory reserves recorded in fiscal year 2011 when compared to fiscal year 2010 tesla gross margin improved due to better production efficiencies was driven by lower product cost and higher unit sales while asps remained stable 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 this increase was a result of better asps and higher unit shipment of our tegra products as well as slightly better revenue from higher margin products and services including development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

  fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009 

our gross margin increased to 354 in fiscal year 2010 from 343 for fiscal year 2009 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by improved yields of our 55nm products transition to 40nm products as well as other manufacturing cost reductions and more favorable product mix particularly with increased sales of higher margin mcp products furthermore during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 our gross margin benefited from the sellthrough of inventory that had previously been written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 this did not have a significant impact on our gross margin for the remaining quarters in fiscal year 2010 offsetting these improvements we recorded a charge to cost of revenue net of insurance reimbursement in the amount of 959 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to 1893 million in fiscal year 2009 related to weak diepacking material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this increase was primarily driven by a shift in mcp product mix toward higher margin intelbased and amdbased platform products we also recorded greater benefits to cost of revenue for insurance reimbursement received and a reduction in the warranty charge arising from a weak diepacking material set in certain versions of our previous generation products as compared to prior year additionally improving yields of our 55nm products a transition to 40nm products and other manufacturing cost reductions achieved during fiscal year 2010 contributed to improvements in gross margin offsetting these improvements were lower asps in our mainstream desktop gpu products as well as in our notebook gpu products that we believe were driven by pricing pressures in the marketplace over the comparable period 

psb  the gross margin of our psb decreased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in asps caused primarily by pricing pressure resulting from the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending during fiscal year 2010 following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decrease was a result of declining revenue from higher margin products and services including development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

 

  

research and development 

  fiscal year 2011 vs fiscal year 2010

· inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products 

· competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and 

· new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

we expect to spend approximately 1500 million to 2000 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2012 primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

  

  

  

  

 

  for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ” 

  

  product defect 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

 

  during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations the net charge amounted to 1939 million of which 1812 million was charged against cost of revenue the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and the other estimated consumer class action settlement as a result of this settlement the other related estimated settlement and offsetting insurance reimbursements we recorded a net charge of 127 million to sales general and administrative expense during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 together with the 2820 million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs this brings the total cumulative net charge to 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales general and administrative 

  

the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 

in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation and the settlement

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 30 2011 and january 31 2010 we had 249 billion and 173 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 30 2011 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

  

  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

  

as of january 30 2011 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately 117 million 

  

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 30 2011 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 51 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 34 of our total investment portfolio of the financial sector investments over half are guaranteed by the us government substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately 3793 million 

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was 24 million 09 million and 20 million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

  we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 30 2011

in the segments we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the cpb segment we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders 

  

although as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer quanta accounted for 12 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2010 

  

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

  

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

  

our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2010 grew by 31 when compared to revenue from the first half of fiscal year 2010 while we anticipate that this historical seasonal trend will resume there can be no assurance of such trend for example this seasonal trend did not occur in fiscal year 2009 where revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2009 declined by 33 when compared to revenue from the first half of fiscal year 2009 due to the worldwide recessionary economic environment at the time 

 

  

manufacturing 

  

fabless manufacturing strategy 

  

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

  

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc and united microelectronics corporation or umc to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering or ase jsi logistics ltd or jsi king yuan electronics co ltd or kyec siliconware precision industries company ltd or spil and stats chippac incorporated or chippac to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products 

  

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

  

inventory and working capital 

  

our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

  

our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 38 at the end of fiscal year 2010 when compared with the end of fiscal year 2009 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

  

  

 

  

  

  

research and development 

  

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and systemonchip architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus including gpus for highperformance computing and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

  

as of january 31 2010 we had 3940 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we incurred research and development expense of 9089 million 8559 million and 6916 million respectively 

competition 

  

  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces or apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share a significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile and consumer products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

 

  

  we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally intel and amd have each announced its intention to integrate a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project and intel’s announcement of its multichip packaged solution codenamed arrandale if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

  

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete for example in the case of our cpb our tegra products primarily compete in architecture used in tablets smartbooks smartphones and other handheld consumer devices 

  

our gpu and mcp products are currently used with both intel and amd processors in february 2009 intel filed suit against us related to a patent license agreement that we signed with intel in 2004 intel seeks an order from the court declaring that the license does not extend to a new intel processor architecture and enjoining us from stating that we have licensing rights for this architecture if intel successfully obtains such a court order we could be unable to sell our mcp products for use with these intel processors and our competitive position would be harmed in addition in order to continue to sell mcp products for use with these intel processors we could be required to negotiate a new license agreement with intel and we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

patents and proprietary rights 

 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from march 25 2010 to june 18 2029 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

  

    our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

  

  as of january 31 2010 we had 5706 employees 3940 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1766 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions we believe our relationships with our employees are good 

 

financial information by business segment and geographic data 

  our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or codm reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance during the last several fiscal years we have operated and reported four major productline operating segments to our codm the gpu business the psb the mcp business and the cpb however effective with the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we will no longer separate our mcp and gpu operating segments as such segmentation will no longer be reflective of the way we manage those businesses our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook personal computers or pcs plus memory products our psb is comprised of our quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products including our nvidia tesla highperformance computing products our mcp business as we have reported it through fiscal year 2010 has been comprised primarily of our ion motherboard gpus or mgpu products our cpb is comprised of our tegra mobile brand and products that support tablets and smartbooks smartphones personal media players or pmps internet television automotive navigation and other similar devices cpb also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices in addition to these operating segments we have the “all other” category that includes human resources legal finance general administration corporate marketing expenses charges related to our stock option purchase restructuring charges and certain vendor price credits not allocated to specific operating segments all of which totaled 3861 million 3461 million and 2662 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively that we do not allocate to our other operating segments as these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our codm “all other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous reporting segments that are neither individually reportable nor aggregated with another operating segment revenue in the “all other” category is primarily derived from sales of components certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal year 

  our codm does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis operating segments do not record intersegment revenue and accordingly there is none to be reported the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for nvidia as a whole the information included in note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k including financial information by business segment and revenue and longlived assets by geographic region is hereby incorporated by reference

available information 

  

our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act are available free of charge on or through our internet web site httpwwwnvidiacom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission or the sec our web site and the information on it or connected to it is not a part of this form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

  

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any minimum quantity of product at any time or at any set price except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation for example revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was somewhat limited by supply constraints related to 40nm products these supply constraints were driven by limited 40nm wafer foundry capacity as well as challenges related to 40nm process manufacturing yields as a result we have been forced to allocate our available 40nm product supply among our customers we expect such supply constraints could have a further limiting impact on our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 

  

because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

  if our thirdparty foundries are not able to transition to new manufacturing process technologies or develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies our operating results and gross margin could be adversely affected 

  

we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we believe this strategy will help us remain competitive our current product families are manufactured using 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer 65 nanometer 55 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin 

  

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our thirdparty manufacturers to invest sufficient funds in new manufacturing processes in order to have ample capacity for all of their customers and to develop the processes in a timely manner our product cycles may also depend on our thirdparty manufacturers migrating to smaller geometry processes successfully and in time for us to meet our customer demands some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly or more successfully than our manufacturing partners if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted if we are forced to use larger geometric processes in manufacturing a product than our competition our gross margin may be reduced the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

 

  

we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacturer our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities will not develop such high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier if our third partyfoundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays if our thirdparty foundries fall behind our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted additionally we cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will manufacturer our products at a price that is competitive to what our competitors pay if our thirdparty foundries do not charge us a competitive price our operating results and gross margin will be negatively impacted 

 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

  

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

  

global economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business as consumers and businesses have postponed spending in response to tighter credit negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which have reduced the demand for our products other factors that could depress demand for our products in the future include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets expectations for inflation labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior these and other economic factors have reduced demand for our products and could further harm our business financial condition and operating results 

  

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and the increased possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have and may in the future materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the recent global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors during this downturn are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

 

 

  

our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products our third party manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

  

we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

 

  

our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

  

demand for many of our revenue components fluctuates and is difficult to predict and our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses sales general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges represented 38 36 and 25 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

if we are unable to sell our mcp products for use with certain intel processors we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

our mcp products are currently used with both intel and amd processors our revenue from mcp products represented 26 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2010 in february 2009 intel filed suit against us related to a patent license agreement that we signed with intel in 2004 intel seeks an order from the court declaring that the license does not extend to a new intel processor architecture and enjoining us from stating that we have licensing rights for this architecture if intel successfully obtains such a court order we could be unable to sell our mcp products for use with these intel processors and our competitive position and financial results would be adversely impacted in addition in order to continue to sell mcp products for use with these intel processors we could be required to negotiate a new license agreement with intel and we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

in march 2009 we asserted counterclaims against intel pursuant to which we seek an order declaring that we have the right to sell certain chipset products with intel’s processors under the chipset license agreement and enjoining intel from interfering with our licensing rights we are also seeking a finding that intel has materially breached its obligations under the chipset license agreement and are requesting various remedies for that breach including termination of intel’s cross licensing rights notwithstanding our belief that the chipset license agreement extends to a component of the new intel processor architecture referred to as direct media interface or dmi we currently have no intentions of building a dmibased chipset while this dispute remains unresolved 

 

if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results could be adversely impacted 

  

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interface or apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share we believe other factors impacting our ability to compete are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  a significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile and consumer products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 

  

 

    our current competitors include the following 

  

 

 

  

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete for example in the case of our cpb our tegra products primarily compete in tablets smartbooks smartphones and other handheld consumer devices we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any of the new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer  

 

we are dependent on the personal computer market and its rate of growth in the future may have a negative impact on our business 

  

we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop personal computer or pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products these changes in demand could be large and sudden during fiscal year 2010 sales of our desktop gpu products increased by approximately 1 compared to fiscal year 2009 the increase in the sale of desktop gpu products was primarily driven by unit volume growth in the highend and mainstream segments as market demand appeared to begin to recover from recessionary conditions that began in the prior year however sales of our notebook gpu products decreased by approximately 31 compared to fiscal year 2009 this decline was driven primarily by a combination of the decline in unit demand and in average selling prices or asps due to increased competition in the marketplace since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

as intel and amd continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

  

we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally intel and amd have each announced its intention to integrate a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project and intel’s announcement of its multichip packaged solution codenamed arrandale if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

  

our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products or entry into or development of a new market is delayed or unsuccessful 

  

in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products as well as identify and enter new markets as our gpus and other processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline in particular average selling prices and gross margins for our gpus and other processors could decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices our gross margin and our financial results we believe the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors outlined elsewhere in these risk factors as well as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  in the past we have experienced delays in the development and adoption of new products and have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory 

 

  

to be successful we must also enter new markets or develop new uses for our future or existing products we cannot accurately predict if our current or existing products or technologies will be successful in the new opportunities or markets that we identify for them or that we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter for example we have developed products and other technology in order for certain generalpurpose computing operations to be performed on a gpu rather than a cpu this general purpose computing which is often referred to as gp computing was a new use for the gpu which had been entirely used for graphics rendering during fiscal year 2008 we introduced our nvidia tesla family of products which was our entry into the highperformance computing industry a new market for us during fiscal year 2010 we introduced our next generation cuda gpu architecture codenamed “fermi” which we expect to be the foundation for computational gpus and enable breakthroughs in both graphics and parallel computing some of our competitors including intel are now developing their own solutions for the discrete graphics and computing markets our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new gpus other products or other technologies or to enter into new markets or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

  

if we are unable to achieve design wins our products may not be adopted by our target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers’ new system configurations this requires that we 

  

 

 

 

 

  

if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers like amd intel and microsoft corporation or microsoft if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers’ product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

if our products do not continue to be adopted by our target markets or if the demand for new and innovative products in our target markets decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

  

our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3d graphics and multimedia in desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing netbooks smartbooks tablets smartphones and video game console applications the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our gpu and mcp businesses together comprised approximately 79 75 and 79 of our revenue for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as such our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus or mcps do not continue to achieve widespread adoption by the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of new products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing netbook smartbooks tablets smartphones and video game console markets we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers oems odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 

  

  

if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results for example during fiscal year 2010 we recorded an additional net warranty charge of 958 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems this charge included an additional accrual of 1644 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 686 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we recorded a net warranty charge of 1893 million charge against cost of revenue for the purpose of supporting the product repair costs of our affected customers around the world this charge included an accrual of 1960 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 67 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2009 in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to the risk entitled “ we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business” for the risk associated with this litigation 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase our engineering and technical resources include 3940 fulltime employees as of january 31 2010 and 3772 employees as of january 25 2009 respectively research and development expenditures were 9089 million 8559 million and 6916 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively research and development expenses included stockbased compensation expense of 1518 million 980 million and 766 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

  

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co siliconware precision industries co ltd and chippac as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin and revenue to decline 

    

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

  

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

  

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

 

  

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

  

we have a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated we recorded approximately 12 of total revenue from one customer approximately 11 of total revenue from one customer and approximately 10 of our total revenue from another customer for fiscal year 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively although a small number of our other customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world who in many cases specify the graphics supplier our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms addin board manufacturers and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us or if we were unable to collect accounts receivable from them our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

  

  any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable including from foreign customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

  our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy we recorded approximately 20 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers at january 31 2010 and approximately 38 of our accounts receivable balance from three customers at january 25 2009 

  

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

we obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our accounts receivable there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk or avoid losses which could harm our financial condition or operating results 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

  

we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 84 87 and 89 of our revenue for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 31 2010 we had offices in fifteen countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

  

our international operations in australia china finland france germany hong kong india japan korea russia singapore sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

  

conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and manufacturers may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 

the economic market social and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and manufacturers are located are unpredictable can be volatile and can have a significant impact on our business because we may be unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner market and political conditions including currency fluctuation terrorism political strife war labor disruption and other factors including natural or manmade disasters adverse changes in tax laws tariff import or export quotas power and water shortages or interruption in air transportation in areas where our independent subcontractors and manufacturers are located could also have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities for example because we rely heavily on tsmc to produce a significant portion of our silicon wafers earthquakes typhoons or other natural disasters in taiwan and asia could limit our wafer supply and thereby harm our business financial condition and operational results 

we are dependent on key employees and the loss of any of these employees could negatively impact our business 

  

our future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our other key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

in addition we rely on stockbased awards as one means for recruiting motivating and retaining highly skilled talent if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

  

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

  

we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management’s attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products our ability to sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted the significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

  we are exposed to credit risk fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

  

all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” securities investments in both fixed rate instruments and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates future declines in the market values of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

at january 31 2010 and january 25 2009 we had 173 billion and 126 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities given the global nature of our business we have invested both domestically and internationally all of our investments are denominated in united states dollars we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 31 2010 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities as of january 31 2010 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 62 of our total cash equivalents and marketable securities while the financial sector accounted for approximately 22 of our total cash equivalents and marketable securities 

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and the increased possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 31 2010 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 62 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 22 of our total investment portfolio of the financial sector investments over half are guaranteed by the us government substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 fair market values for these investments would decrease by approximately 2767 million 

 

 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

  

we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we recorded an additional net warranty charge of 958 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems this charge included an additional accrual of 1644 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 686 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we recorded a net warranty charge of 1893 million against cost of revenue for the purpose of supporting the product repair costs of our affected customers around the world this charge included an accrual of 1960 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 67 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2009 although the number of units that we estimate will be impacted by this issue remains consistent with our initial estimates in july 2008 the overall cost of remediation and repair of impacted systems has been higher than originally anticipated the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 

 

the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine with certainty a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

 

we continue to seek access to our insurance coverage regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set we received 705 million and 80 million in reimbursements from insurance providers during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products 

  

in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are a party to other litigation including patent litigation which if determined adversely to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are a party to other litigation as both a defendant and as a plaintiff for example we are engaged in litigation with intel corporation rambus corporation and with various parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on these lawsuits there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

  

changes in us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in may 2009 president obama’s administration provided details of previously announced international tax proposals that if enacted into law would have substantially reduced our ability to defer us taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states in october 2009 the obama administration announced it no longer intended to pursue such proposals outside of a broader initiative to overhaul the corporate tax system expected in 2010 however in february 2010 the obama administration released its fiscal year 2011 budget with proposed modifications to international tax laws that would again substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes on indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings eliminate or substantially reduce our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states if any of these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

    

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

  

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement 

  

an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

  

in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

 

 

 

  

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties’ patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

    

government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties and could result in litigation against us 

  

in the past we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the department of justice and the sec we may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future which may lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties 

  

in addition litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

  

since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

  

we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1071 million 1627 million 1334 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results additionally in march 2009 we completed a cash tender offer to purchase certain employee stock options a total of 285 million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of 781 million in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options as a result of the tender offer we incurred a charge of 1402 million consisting of the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees we believe that expensing employee equity compensation will continue to negatively impact our operating results 

  

to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

    

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

under us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

  

our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses 

  

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance 

  

in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities for example following our announcement in july 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2009 the trading price of our common stock declined in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us relating to this announcement please refer to note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these lawsuits due to changes in the potential volatility of our stock price we may be the target of securities litigation in the future such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   

  

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 

 

 

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

    

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products for example we are subject to the european union directive on restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive that restricts the use of a number of substances including lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the european union we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august 15 2005 

  

it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages delays or excess noncompliant inventory may occur as a result of the rohs directive weee and other domestic or international environmental regulations failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including costs fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability to conduct business in the countries or states that have adopted these types of regulations 

  

while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies’ internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

  

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with usgaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

  

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

 

 

 

  

  on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

3dfx 

  

on december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfx’s october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfx’s former landlords one by 3dfx’s bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfx’s equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate 

  

landlord lawsuits 

in may 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s san jose california commercial real estate lease carlyle fortran trust or carlyle in december 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s austin texas commercial real estate lease carramerica realty corporation or carramerica the landlords both asserted claims for among other things interference with contract successor liability and fraudulent transfer the landlords sought to recover damages in the aggregate amount of approximately 15 million representing amounts then owed on the 3dfx leases the cases were later removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california when 3dfx filed its bankruptcy petition and consolidated for pretrial purposes with an action brought by the bankruptcy trustee 

  

in 2005 the us district court for the northern district of california withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court for the landlords’ actions and on november 10 2005 granted our motion to dismiss both landlords’ complaints the landlords filed amended complaints in early february 2006 and nvidia again filed motions to dismiss those claims on september 29 2006 the district court dismissed the carramerica action in its entirety and without leave to amend on december 15 2006 the district court also dismissed the carlyle action in its entirety both landlords filed timely notices of appeal from those orders 

on july 17 2008 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit held oral argument on the landlords’ appeals on november 25 2008 the court of appeals issued its opinion affirming the dismissal of carlyle’s complaint in its entirety the court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of most of carramerica’s complaint but reversed the district court’s dismissal of carramerica’s claims for interference with contractual relations and fraud on december 8 2008 carlyle filed a request for rehearing en banc  which carramerica joined that same day carlyle also filed a motion for clarification of the court’s opinion on january 22 2009 the court of appeals denied the request for rehearing en banc  but clarified its opinion affirming dismissal of the claims by stating that carramerica had standing to pursue claims for interference with contractual relations fraud conspiracy and tort of another and remanding carlyle’s case with instructions that the district court evaluate whether the trustee had abandoned any claims which carlyle might have standing to pursue on april 2 2009 carlyle filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the court of appeals decision we filed an opposition to that petition on june 8 2009 on october 5 2009 the us supreme court denied carlyle’s petition 

  

the district court held a status conference in the carramerica and carlyle cases on march 9 2009 that same day 3dfx’s bankruptcy trustee filed in the bankruptcy court a notice of trustee’s intention to compromise controversy with carlyle fortran trust according to that notice the trustee would abandon any claims it has against us for intentional interference with contract negligent interference with prospective economic advantage aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty declaratory relief unfair business practices and tort of another in exchange for which carlyle will withdraw irrevocably its proof of claim against the 3dfx bankruptcy estate and waive any further right of distribution from the estate in light of the trustee’s notice the district court ordered the parties to seek a hearing on the notice on or before april 24 2009 ordered carlyle and carramerica to file amended complaints by may 10 2009 and set a further case management conference for may 18 2009 the parties subsequently filed a stipulation requesting that the district court vacate the may 18 2009 case management conference date and other deadlines until after bankruptcy court rendered its decision at a hearing on may 13 2009 the bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee had not abandoned any claims against us and denied the trustees notice of intention to compromise controversy with carlyle fortran trust without prejudice carlyle filed a motion in the district court for leave to file an interlocutory appeal from the order denying the notice which was denied on november 12 2009 on january 13 2010 the district court of its own accord reconsidered and reversed its decision denying carlyle’s motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal and has set the interlocutory appeal for hearing on april 26 2010 

on july 7 2009 the parties attended a case management conference in the district court for both the carramerica and the carlyle cases on july 8 2009 the district court issued an order requiring that carramerica file an amended complaint on or before august 10 2009 carramerica filed its amended complaint on august 10 2009 alleging claims for interference with contractual relations fraud conspiracy and tort of another thereafter we filed motions directed at dismissing that fourth amended complaint and carramerica responded by filing a fifth amended complaint nvidia moved to dismiss the fifth amended complaint but the district court denied that motion by order dated january 27 2010 in that same order however the court invited the parties to move for summary judgment and set the motions for hearing on may 3 2010 nvidia intends to prepare and file such a motion we continue to believe that there is no merit to carlyle or carramerica’s remaining claims 

  

  

trustee lawsuit 

  

in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate served his complaint on nvidia the trustee’s complaint asserts claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us the trustee’s fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfx’s assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 70 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 50 million the trustee’s successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfx’s legal successor and was therefore responsible for all of 3dfx’s unpaid liabilities this action was consolidated for pretrial purposes with the landlord cases as noted above 

  

on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 108 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustee’s request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 108 million 

in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustee’s constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as “property” subject to the bankruptcy court’s avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the “property” identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid “reasonably equivalent” to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties’ contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction” this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustee’s action however as the trustee’s claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidia’s favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court where the appeal is pending the district court’s hearing on the trustee’s appeal was held on june 10 2009 and the appeal remains under submission 

  

while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustee’s case still remains pending on appeal accordingly we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million – 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx – that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee’s case 

  

  

the equitycommittee lawsuit 

  

on december 8 2005 the trustee filed a form 8k on behalf of 3dfx disclosing the terms of the conditional settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor’s committee thereafter certain 3dfx shareholders filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interests of 3dfx shareholders the court granted that petition and appointed an equity securities holders’ committee or the equity committee the equity committee thereafter sought and obtained an order granting it standing to bring suit against nvidia for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate to compel nvidia to pay the stock consideration then unpaid from the apa and filed its own competing plan of reorganizationliquidation the equity committee’s plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be used to retire all of 3dfx’s debts and thus to trigger nvidia’s obligation to pay six million shares of stock consideration specified in the apa nvidia contends among other things that such a commitment is not sufficient and that its obligation to pay the stock consideration had long before been extinguished on may 1 2006 the equity committee filed its lawsuit for declaratory relief to compel nvidia to pay the stock consideration in addition the equity committee filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd an equity investment fund that conditionally agreed to pay no more than 515 million for preferred stock in 3dfx the hearing on that motion was held on january 18 2007 and the bankruptcy court approved the proposed protections 

after the bankruptcy court denied our motion to dismiss on september 6 2006 the equity committee again amended its complaint and nvidia moved to dismiss that amended complaint as well on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court granted the motion as to one of the equity committee’s claims and denied it as to the others however the bankruptcy court also ruled that nvidia would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which the equity committee seeks determinations that 1 the apa was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection 2 the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the apa and 3 the apa is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy estate 

because of the trial of the trustee’s fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia the equity committee’s lawsuit did not progress substantially in 2007 on july 31 2008 the equity committee filed a motion for summary judgment on its first three causes of action on september 15 2008 nvidia filed a crossmotion for summary judgment on october 24 2008 the court held a hearing on the parties’ crossmotions for summary judgment on january 6 2009 the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum decision granting nvidia’s motion and denying the equity committee’s motion and entered an order to that effect on january 30 2009 on february 27 2009 the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of nvidia the equity committee has waived its right to appeal by stipulation entered on february 18 2009 and the judgment is now final

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

  the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “item 1a risk factors” “item 6 selected financial data” our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase hold or sell shares of our common stock 

overview 

our company 

  

  nvidia corporation helped awaken the world to the power of computer graphics when it invented the graphics processor unit or gpu in 1999 expertise in programmable gpus has led to breakthroughs in parallel processing which make supercomputing inexpensive and widely accessible we serve the entertainment and consumer market with our geforce graphics products the professional design and visualization market with our quadro graphics products the highperformance computing market with our tesla computing solutions products and the mobile computing market with our tegra systemonachip products during the last several fiscal years we have operated and reported four major productline operating segments the gpu business the professional solutions business or psb the media and communications processor or mcp business and the consumer products business or cpb however effective with the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we will no longer separate our mcp and gpu operating segments as such segmentation will no longer be reflective of the way we manage those businesses 

  

  our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook personal computers or pcs in addition to memory products our psb is comprised of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products including our nvidia tesla highperformance computing products our mcp business as we have reported it through fiscal year 2010 has been comprised primarily of ion mgpu products our ion family of products addresses the integrated core logic market our cpb is comprised of our tegra mobile products that support tablets and smartbooks smartphones personal media players or pmps internet television automotive navigation and other similar devices cpb also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices original equipment manufacturers original design manufacturers addincard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies worldwide utilize our processors as a core component of their entertainment business and professional solutions 

  

  we were incorporated in california in april 1993 and reincorporated in delaware in april 1998 our headquarter facilities are in santa clara california our internet address is wwwnvidiacom  the contents of our website are not a part of this form 10k 

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

  

gpu business 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we introduced our next generation cuda gpu architecture codenamed “fermi” we expect the fermi architecture to be the foundation for computational gpus and to enable breakthroughs in both graphics and parallel computing 

during fiscal year 2010 we also delivered our first 40nm gpus to customers because of limited 40nm wafer foundry capacity plus supplier challenges related to 40nm process manufacturing yields we have been forced to allocate our available 40nm product supply among our customers we are currently working with our foundry partners to address these challenges 

professional solutions business 

  

corporate demand which comprises a substantial percentage of the demand for our professional workstation products has recently shown some signs of economic recovery workstation product revenue currently comprises a significant portion of our total psb revenue therefore if corporate demand continues to recover we expect this trend to continue to have a positive impact on our overall gross profit and gross margin as the gross margin experienced by our psb is generally higher than our overall gross margin 

 

  

mcp business 

during fiscal year 2010 we began redirecting our development strategy in our mcp business in response to our ongoing dispute with intel in february 2009 intel filed suit against us related to a chipset license agreement that we entered into with intel in 2004 in march 2009 we asserted counterclaims against intel pursuant to which we seek an order declaring that intel breached the chipset license agreement as well as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing underlying the license agreements and seeking among other things termination of intels cross license to our technology notwithstanding our belief that the chipset license agreement extends to a component of the new intel processor architecture referred to as direct media interface or dmi we currently have no intention of building a dmibased chipset while this dispute remains unresolved as a result we began redirecting our mcp development resources to other programs 

  

consumer products business 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we demonstrated the tegra 600 series our first generation systemonachip that enables an alwayson alwaysconnected hd netbook that can go days between battery charges also during fiscal year 2010 our tegra product was included in microsoft’s zune hd and the samsung m1 both of which were being sold in the marketplace in addition we announced our nextgeneration of tegra processing technology during the recent consumer electronics show in january 2010 tegra is the processor for the mobile web specifically designed for the highresolution needs of tablets tegra combines browsing streaming 1080p video and flash 101 acceleration with a 3d user interface and days of battery life we have multiple nextgeneration tegra design wins in tablets smartbooks and smartphones with the first of these expected to ship during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 we’ve also announced that volkswagen and audi will use nextgeneration tegra starting in 2012 additionally we announced 3d vision surround for geforce a highdefinition 3d stereo solution for the home at the recent consumer electronics show in january 2010 3d vision is a combination of wireless glasses a highpower infrared emitter and software that transforms pc games into full stereoscopic 3d experiences over 420 games now support nvidia 3d vision 

 

tender offer 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than 1750 per share none of the nonemployee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section 16a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including our former chief financial officer marvin d burkett were eligible to participate in the offer all eligible options with exercise prices less than 2800 per share but not less than 1750 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 300 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option all eligible options with exercise prices greater than 2800 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 200 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 

  

a total of 285 million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of 781 million which was paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options as a result of the tender offer we incurred a charge of 1402 million consisting of 1241 million related to the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer 116 million related to stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options plus 45 million related to associated payroll taxes professional fees and other costs 

  

product defect 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

during fiscal year 2010 we recorded an additional net warranty charge of 958 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems this charge included an additional accrual of 1644 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 686 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we recorded a net warranty charge of 1893 million charge against cost of revenue for the purpose of supporting the product repair costs of our affected customers around the world this charge included an accrual of 1960 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 67 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2009 although the number of units that we estimate will be impacted by this issue remains consistent with our initial estimates in july 2008 the overall cost of remediation and repair of impacted systems has been higher than originally anticipated the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 

the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine with certainty a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

we continue to seek access to our insurance coverage regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products 

in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation 

  

  subsequent event 

our board of directors has authorized us subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of 27 billion through may 2010 through january 31 2010 we have repurchased an aggregate of 909 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 146 billion as of january 31 2010 we are authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an additional amount of 124 billion through may 2010 on march 16 2010 our board of directors further authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program from may 2010 to may 2013 

the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors or board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenue recognition 

 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue or incremental operating expense at the time such programs are offered 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

 

  

  license and development revenue 

  

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

accounts receivable 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen such as the when the worldwide economy is experiencing a significant downturn the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the risk that financial institutions mighty consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a lower than normal level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from this type of credit crisis on our business including inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which could negatively impact our financial results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 

as of january 31 2010 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 10 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 4140 million of the 4140 million 959 million was covered by credit insurance and 158 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit we have incurred cumulative bad debts of 05 million over the last three fiscal years as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 01 and 03 during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively as of january 31 2010 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

  

inventories 

  

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped so if actual market conditions are more favorable in the fiscal periods subsequent to that in which we record larger than normal inventory reserves we may have higher gross margins when products are sold as of january 31 2010 our inventory reserve was 648 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 78 and 196 during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 as of january 31 2010 our inventory reserve represented 164 of our gross inventory balance 

 

  

warranty liabilities 

cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  

during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we recorded 1644 million and 1960 million respectively as warranty charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems the mcp and gpu products that were impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products were identified as failing in the field at higher than normal rates 

determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs however if actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

income taxes 

  we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

  

  our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

as of january 31 2010 we had a valuation allowance of 1134 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period the realization occurred 

  

  

  our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4015 million as of january 31 2010 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to do a withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

  

we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information 

  

goodwill 

  

  our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments or components of an operating segment for the purposes of completing our goodwill impairment test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fair valuebased approach 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 our market capitalization increased over 100 when compared to the same period in fiscal year 2009 we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value this assessment was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis analysis of market comparables where appropriate and analysis of our market capitalization determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

 

our estimates of cash flows were based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of some or all of our reporting units determining the fair value of our reporting units also requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables if there are any and the amount of weight to ascribe to fair value measurements that are based on the market approach 

any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with some or all of our reporting units 

  

  cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

  cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholder’s equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets level 1 valuations are obtained from realtime quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets level 2 valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets level 3 valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value while most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs the valuation of our holdings of the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund are classified as a level 3 input due to the inherent subjectivity and the significant judgment involved in its valuation total financial assets at fair value classified within level 3 were 04 of total assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2010 

all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

our stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service periodwe recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 

 

 

 

  

  

 

we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 using the following assumptions 

  

 

  

  accounting standards also require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with usgaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs

revenue 

  

fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009 

  

  revenue was 333 billion for the fiscal year 2010 and 342 billion for fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 3 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue decreased by 8 to 176 billion for fiscal year 2010 compared to 191 billion for fiscal year 2009 the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales of notebook gpus offset by a slight increase in sales of memory products sales of our notebook gpu products decreased by approximately 31 while sales of our desktop gpu products were essentially flat increasing by only 1 and our memory products increased by 38 as compared to fiscal year 2009 the decrease in notebook gpu revenue was driven primarily by a combination of a decline in unit demand and a decline in average selling price “asps” as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and due to share losses we experienced within the notebook segment during calendar year 2009 compared to calendar year 2008 as reported in the november pc graphics 2009 report from mercury research the very slight increase in sales of our desktop gpu products resulted from an increase in unit volume in fiscal year 2010 which was driven by a strong unit sales recovery during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 offset by a decline in asps for the full fiscal year which was driven by pricing pressures in the marketplace for our highend and mainstream products sales of our memory products increased as a result of the overall increase in desktop gpu unit demand 

psb  psb revenue decreased by 26 to 5102 million for the fiscal year 2010 as compared to 6934 million for fiscal year 2009 both the asps and unit shipments of professional workstation products decreased primarily due to the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 

mcp business  mcp business revenue increased by 33 to 8716 million for fiscal year 2010 as compared to 6556 million for fiscal year 2009 the increase was a result of increased sales of our intelbased platform products by over 100 offset by a decrease in sales of our amdbased platform products by approximately 12 the increase in intelbased platform product sales was driven by sales of our ion products the decrease in amdbased platform products was driven by limited availability of lowend amd cpus in the marketplace during the last half of fiscal year 2010 as well as by amd continuing to market their own chipset product lines in place of ours 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 20 to 1639 million for fiscal year 2010 as compared to 1363 million for fiscal year 2009 this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from our embedded products for the automotive and entertainment markets and was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

  

  

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008 

  

revenue was 342 billion for fiscal year 2009 compared to 410 billion for fiscal year 2008 which represents a decrease of 16 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business   gpu business revenue decreased by 24 to 191 billion for fiscal year 2009 compared to 252 billion for fiscal year 2008 this decrease resulted from decreased sales of our desktop gpu and memory products offset by increased sales of our notebook gpu products sales of our desktop gpu and memory products decreased by approximately 29 and 59 respectively in fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 these decreases were primarily due to a decline in the standalone desktop market segment as reported in the december 2008 pc graphics report from mercury research driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products this overall market decline translated into a decline of over 20 in the number of units of desktop gpu products that we sold in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 the decline in desktop gpu revenue also reflects the impact of a slight average sales price regression in our products and a decline in our share position during the middle portion of fiscal year 2009 as a result of increased competition memory sales declined as a result of a decline in sales of our highend desktop gpu products sales of our notebook gpu products increased approximately 3 in fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 due to higher unit sales aided by a market move toward notebook pcs over desktop pcs offset by a slight decline in average selling prices additionally the overall global economic recessionary climate contributed to a significant decline in the demand for total graphics during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 

psb psb revenue increased by 18 to 6934 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 5884 million for fiscal year 2008 our nvidia professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall unit increase of approximately 15 in shipments of boards and chips as compared to fiscal year 2008 due to strong demand and our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce 8based and geforce 9based products sales of nvidia quadro cx for adobe’s cs4 software which we launched in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 also contributed towards the increase in sales in fiscal year 2009 

  

mcp business mcp business revenue decreased by 8 to 6556 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 7104 million for fiscal year 2008 this decrease was due to a decline of approximately 32 in sales of our amdbased platform products resulting from increased competition in amdbased products offset by an increase of approximately 120 in sales of our intelbased platform products the increase in intelbased product sales was driven by sales of our geforce 9400m mgpu which we launched in october 2008 along with apple inc or apple for their new lineup of mac notebooks and our new geforce 9400 and 9300 mgpus for intel desktop pcs 

  

cpb cpb revenue decreased by 46 to 1363 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 2511 million for fiscal year 2008 the decline in cpb revenue is primarily driven by a combination of a decrease in revenue from our cell phone products and a decrease in revenue from sony computer entertainment or sce the decrease in revenue from our cell phone products resulted from our shift from marketing and developing legacy products to achieving design wins and marketing our newer tegra products the decrease in our revenue from sce resulted from a decline in license revenue and a decline in royalty revenue that was caused by a lower number of units shipped as well as by a stepdown in the per unit royalty rate during the year due to achievement of a unitbased milestone in our agreement with sce 

concentration of revenue 

  

  we generated 84 87 and 89 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers or cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  gross profit and gross margin 

  

  gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 

  

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 354 343 and 456 for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 

our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix we expect gross margin to be in the range of 44 to 45 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 

a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

  

  fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009 

our gross margin increased to 354 in fiscal year 2010 from 343 for fiscal year 2009 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by improved yields of our 55nm products transition to 40nm products as well as other manufacturing cost reductions and more favorable product mix particularly with increased sales of higher margin mcp products furthermore during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 our gross margin benefited from the sellthrough of inventory that had previously been written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 this did not have a significant impact on our gross margin for the remaining quarters in fiscal year 2010 offsetting these improvements we recorded a charge to cost of revenue net of insurance reimbursement in the amount of 959 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to 1893 million in fiscal year 2009 related to weak diepacking material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business decreased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decline resulted from lower asps in our mainstream desktop gpu products as well as in our notebook gpu products that we believe were driven by pricing pressures in the marketplace over the comparable period these factors were further exacerbated in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of losses we incurred selling certain older transitioning products these decreases in gross margins were offset by improving yields of our 55nm products a transition to 40nm products and other manufacturing cost reductions achieved during fiscal year 2010 plus a net benefit arising from the sellthrough of inventory during primarily the first half of fiscal year 2010 that had previously been written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 

psb  the gross margin of our psb decreased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in asps caused primarily by pricing pressure resulting from the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending during fiscal year 2010 following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009  

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business increased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this increase was primarily driven by a shift in product mix toward higher margin intelbased and amdbased platform products and a reduction in the warranty charge arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation products in addition we recorded greater benefits to cost of revenue for insurance reimbursements received during the comparable periods 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 this decrease was a result of declining revenue from higher margin products and services including development arrangements and royalties from game consolerelated products in the comparative periods 

 

  

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008 

our gross margin declined to 343 in fiscal year 2009 from 456 for fiscal year 2008 the gross margin for fiscal year 2009 includes the impact of a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems offset by allocated insurance claim proceeds of 67 million from an insurance provider this warranty charge had an adverse impact of approximately 60 on our gross margin for fiscal year 2009 we also incurred a charge of 45 million related to a royalty dispute during fiscal year 2009 additionally inventory reserves taken during fiscal year 2009 were approximately 500 million higher compared to fiscal year 2008 reflecting a significant decline in our forecasted future demand for the related products and having a negative impact on our gross margin 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business decreased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this decrease was due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation gpu products used in notebook systems the negative impact of inventory reserves taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and average sales price regression in our geforce 9based and previous generations of desktop products resulting from increased competition the average sales price regression was also driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products 

psb  the gross margin of our psb increased slightly during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 9based nvidia quadro products which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and geforce 8based nvidia quadro products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 due to a decline in the margins of our amd and intelbased products during fiscal year 2009 gross margins declined primarily due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp products used in notebook systems 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this increase was primarily due to changes in the product mix in our cpb product lines we experienced greater revenue decline in our lower margin cell phone and other handheld devices product lines as compared to higher margin sce transactions in the current year 

operating expenses 

  

 

  

 

  

  research and development 

  fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009 

research and development expenses increased by 530 million or 6 the majority of the increase was caused by stockbased compensation charges recorded during fiscal year 2010 of 905 million related to a tender offer that closed in march 2009 offset by a reduction in ongoing stockbased compensation expense of 367 million resulting from the cancellation of stock options pursuant to the tender offer compensation and benefits related to research and development increased by 119 million due to additional new hires and depreciation and amortization expense increased by 42 million due to property and equipment purchases additionally our cost reduction initiatives across several discretionary spending areas resulted in decreased expenses related to computer software and equipment of 77 million travel and entertainment of 54 million employee related expenses of 35 million and development expenses of 28 million 

  

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008 

  research and development expenses increased by 1643 million or 24 the increase was primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 649 million primarily as a result of the net addition of approximately 500 personnel in departments related to research and development functions offset by lower expenses during fiscal year 2009 related to our variable compensation programs when compared to fiscal year 2008 stockbased compensation expense increased by 214 million primarily because of the impact of new hire and semiannual stock awards granted subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 offset by a reduction in expense related to older stock awards that were almost fully vested and for which the related expense had been almost fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 development expenses increased by 188 million primarily due to increase in expenses related to engineering services prototype materials and internal board requests other increases in research and development expenses are primarily related to costs that were driven by personnel growth including depreciation and amortization facilities and computer software and equipment 

 

  sales general and administrative 

  fiscal year 2010 vs fiscal year 2009

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income net of interest expense consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income decreased to 198 million in fiscal year 2010 from 425 million in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to the result of lower interest rates and interest expense recorded on a capital lease for a data center in santa clara california during fiscal year 2010 interest income decreased to 425 million in fiscal year 2009 from 642 million in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the result of lower average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and lower interest rates in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy two customers accounted for approximately 20 of our accounts receivable balance at january 31 2010 while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

· decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers’ products 

· inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products 

· competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and 

· new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

  we expect to spend approximately 1100 million to 2000 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2011 primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

  

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ” 

  

  3dfx asset purchase 

  on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa which closed on april 18 2001 to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx under the terms of the apa the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the apa also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx one million shares which due to subsequent stock splits now totals six million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 

  in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought among other things payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx in early november 2005 nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement 

  

  the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process and the trustee’s case still remains pending appeal as such we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee’s case

  product defect 

  during fiscal year 2010 we recorded an additional net warranty charge of 958 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems this charge included an additional accrual of 1644 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 686 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we recorded a net warranty charge of 1893 million charge against cost of revenue for the purpose of supporting the product repair costs of our affected customers around the world this charge included an accrual of 1960 million for related estimated costs offset by reimbursements from insurance carriers of 67 million that we recorded against cost of revenue during fiscal year 2009 although the number of units that we estimate will be impacted by this issue remains consistent with our initial estimates in july 2008 the overall cost of remediation and repair of impacted systems has been higher than originally anticipated the weak diepackaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 

  we continue to seek access to our insurance coverage regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement 

  through january 31 2010 we have made an aggregate of 2335 million in cash payments related to the warranty accrual associated with incremental repair and replacement costs from the weak diepackaging material set and our remaining accrual balance was 881 million 

 

  in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

  

as of january 31 2010 and january 25 2009 we had 173 billion and 126 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 31 2010 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

  

  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

  

as of january 31 2010 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 83 million 

  

the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 31 2010 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 62 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 22 of our total investment portfolio of the financial sector investments over half are guaranteed by the us government substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 fair market values for these investments would decline by approximately 2767 million 

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 was 09 million 20 million and 17 million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

  we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 31 2010

  we believe that recent years have experienced an increasing level of global adoption for the computeraided design approach of product creation we have achieved a leading position in the professional graphics category by providing innovative gpu technology software and tools that integrate the capabilities of our gpu with a broad array of visualization products 

 

  during fiscal year 2009 we launched several new quadro solutions these included the quadro fx 3600m professional which is among the highest performing notebook gpus and the quadro plex d series a dedicated desk side vcs system that alternatively can be configured using two quadro plex d systems for a 3u configuration that fits a standard 19” rack environment at the siggraph 2008 conference the quadro plex d2 system set a new milestone in computer graphics by demonstrating the world’s first realtime fullyinteractive ray tracer we also launched five new quadro fx notebook gpus that spanned from ultrahigh performance to ultra mobility as well as the quadro cx the industry’s first accelerator for adobe’s creative suite 4 or adobe cs4 content creation software adobe cs4 software has added optimization to take advantage of gpu technology the quadro cx is specifically designed to enhance the performance of the adobe cs4 product line and to give creative professionals the ultimate performance and productivity 

 

  during fiscal year 2009 we also we launched the tesla c1060 computing processor and the tesla s1070 computing system which is among the first teraflop processors and has a 1u system demonstrating up to four teraflops of performance tesla is a new family of gpu computing products that delivers processing capabilities for highperformance computing applications and marks our entry into the highperformance computing industry the tesla family also consists of the c870 gpu computing processor the d870 deskside supercomputer and the s870 1u computing server we believe we are in an era of gpu computing where our cuda parallel processing architecture can accelerate computeintensive applications by significant multiples over that of a central processing unit or cpu alone nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the parallel compute engine in our graphics processing units to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required on a cpu there are currently over 25000 developers around the world using cuda in order to program using the cuda architecture developers can today use c one of the most widely used highlevel programming languages which can then be run at great performance on a cuda enabled processor we expect other languages to be supported in the future including fortran and c 

 

  with cuda we are able to speed up general purpose computeintensive applications like we do for 3d graphics processing developers are able to speedup algorithms in areas ranging from nano molecular dynamics to image processing medical image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis over 100 universities around the world now teach parallel programming with cuda and many pc oems now offer high performance computing solutions with tesla for use by customers around the world including motorola chevron ge health care and even general mills the consumer products company researchers use cuda to accelerate their timetodiscovery and popular offtheshelf software packages are now cuda accelerated 

 

  mcp business 

 

  our mcp business is comprised of nforce core logic and geforce mgpu products our nforce and geforce mgpu families of products address the core logic market core logic is the computer’s “central nervous system” controlling and directing high speed data between the central processing unit or cpu the gpu storage and networks high quality longterm reliability and top performance are key customer demands of core logic suppliers 

 

  during fiscal year 2008 we announced a new technology named hybrid sli this technology combines the multigpu technology with a powerful and energyefficient engine when geforce addin graphics cards are connected to geforce mgpus hybrid sli kicks in combining their processing power to deliver an improved experience the technology is application aware so depending on the processing demands of each application running on the host pc the discrete gpu may be completely shut down in order to save power 

 

  during fiscal year 2009 we shipped hybrid sli dx10 mgpus – the geforce 8000 gpu series the geforce 8000 gpu series includes geforce boost hybrid sli technology which is designed to double performance when paired with a geforce 8 series desktop gpu we also extended the reach of sli technology into the performance category with the launch of our nvidia nforce 790i ultra sli mcp a highly rated overclockable platform for intel corporation or intel processors   during fiscal year 2009 we launched the geforce 9m series of notebook gpus that enables improved performance in notebooks with hybrid sli technology and physx technology we also launched sli for intel broomfield cpu platforms when paired with the nforce 200 sli mcp intel’s bloomfield cpu and tylersburg core logic chipset will deliver nvidia threeway sli technology with up to a 28 times performance boost over single graphics card platforms 

 

  in fiscal year 2009 we launched the geforce 9400m mgpu along with apple inc or apple for their new lineup of mac notebooks the geforce 9400m integrates three complex chips – the northbridge the inputoutput network processor and the geforce gpu into a single chip and as a result significantly improves performance over intel integrated graphics apple’s macbook and macbook air notebook computers come standard with the geforce 9400m apple’s macbook pro notebook computer comes standard with the hybrid combination of two geforce gpus  a geforce 9400m for maximum battery life and a geforce 9600m gt for high performance mode we also launched the geforce 9400 and 9300 mgpus for intel desktop pcs these new mgpus set a new priceperformance standard for integrated graphics by combining the power of three different chips into one highly compact and efficient gpu 

  additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 we announced the nvidia ion platform which combines the geforce 9400 gpu with the intel atom cpu the combination enables netbooks small form factor and allinone pcs to play rich media and popular games in high definition 

 

  our mcp strategy is to bring the benefits of geforce gpus to the most price sensitive categories while creating exciting platform architectures like sli hybrid sli and enthusiast system architecture or esa esa is a standard for system information protocol that links a pc system’s various critical components – such as fan power supply smart chassis gpus and motherboards it enables a unified architecture for applications and users to control and optimize the performance of their system sli hybrid sli and esa are examples of how we create architectures that advance the capabilities of the pc

  sustain technology and product leadership in 3d graphics and hd video and media communications and ultralow power  we are focused on using our advanced engineering capabilities to accelerate the quality and performance of 3d graphics hd video media communications and ultralow power processing in pcs and handheld devices a fundamental aspect of our strategy is to actively recruit the best 3d graphics and hd video networking and communications engineers in the industry and we believe that we have assembled an exceptionally experienced and talented engineering team our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus including gpus for highperformance computing mcps and mobile and consumer products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices using independent design teams as we have in the past we intend to use this strategy to achieve new levels of graphics networking and communications features and performance and ultralow power designs enabling our customers to achieve superior performance in their products 

 

  increase market share  we believe that substantial market share will be important to achieving success we intend to achieve a leading share of the market in areas in which we dont have a leading market share and maintain a leading share of the market in areas in which we do have the lead by devoting substantial resources to building families of products for a wide range of applications that offer significant improvement in performance over existing products 

 

  use our expertise in digital multimedia  we believe the synergy created by the combination of 3d graphics hd video and the internet will fundamentally change the way people work learn communicate and play we believe that our expertise in hd graphics and system architecture positions us to help drive this transformation we are using our expertise in the processing and transmission of highbandwidth digital media to develop products designed to address the requirements of highbandwidth concurrent multimedia 

 

  use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts from time to time we expect to enter into license arrangements that will require significant customization of our intellectual property components for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for example in fiscal year 2006 we entered into an agreement with sony computer entertainment inc or sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce’s playstation3 our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation3 and all derivatives including nextgeneration digital consumer electronics devices in addition we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce 

 

  revolutionize computing with cuda and tesla tesla is a family of gpu computing products that delivers processing capabilities for highperformance computing applications and marks our entry into the highperformance computing industry nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the parallel compute engine in nvidia gpus to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required on a cpu we believe we are in an era of gpu computing where our cuda parallel processing architecture can accelerate computeintensive applications by significant multiples over that of a cpu alone we are working with developers around the world to adopt and write application programs for the cuda architecture using c one of the most widely used highlevel programming languages which can then be run at great execution speeds on a cuda enabled processor we expect other languages to be supported in the future including fortran and c with cuda we are able to speed up general purpose computeintensive applications like we do for 3d graphics processing developers are able to speedup algorithms in areas ranging from nano molecular dynamics to image processing medical image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis we are also working with universities around the world who now teach parallel programming with cuda and we are also working with many pc oems who now offer high performance computing solutions with tesla for use by their customers around the world researchers also use cuda to accelerate their timetodiscovery and popular offtheshelf software packages are now cuda accelerated 

sales and marketing 

 

  our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and applications processors that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

 

  in the gpu and mcp segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the cpb segment we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system builders 

 

  although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to our largest customer hewlettpackard company accounted for 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2009 

 

  to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

 

  our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant consequently we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

 

dependence on pc market 

  we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products changes in demand for our products could be large and sudden during fiscal year 2009 sales of our desktop gpu products decreased approximately 29 compared to fiscal year 2008 these decreases were primarily due to the standalone desktop and standalone notebook gpu market segment decline as reported in the pc graphics december 2008 report from mercury research since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

seasonality 

 

  our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand this seasonal trend did not occur in fiscal year 2009 revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2009 declined by 33 when compared to revenue from the first half of fiscal year 2009 the current recessionary economic environment has created substantial uncertainty in our business there can be no assurance that the historical seasonal trend will resume in the future 

manufacturing 

 

  fabless manufacturing strategy 

 

  we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

 

  we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc united microelectronics corporation or umc chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered semiconductor manufacturing international corporation or smic and austria micro systems or ams to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering or ase amkor technology or amkor jsi logistics ltd or jsi king yuan electronics co ltd or kyec siliconware precision industries company ltd or spil and stats chippac incorporated or chippac to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products 

 

  we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

 

  product defect 

 

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

 

  for example in july 2008 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems all of our newly manufactured products and all of our products that are currently shipping in volume have a different material set that we believe is more robust the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the mcp and gpu products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

 

  we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage which provided us with 80 million in related reimbursement during fiscal year 2009 however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 

 

inventory and working capital 

 

  our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

 

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business 

research and development 

 

  we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power communications storage and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and our consumer products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

 

  a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

 

  we substantially increased our engineering and technical resources in fiscal year 2009 and had 3772 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 25 2009 compared to 3255 employees as of january 27 2008 and 2668 employees as of january 28 2007 during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we incurred research and development expenditures of 8559 million 6916 million and 5535 million respectively 

  

  

  

competition 

 

    the market for gpus mcps and computeronachip products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces or apis manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

 

  a significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and computeronachip products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes currently intel which has greater resources than we do is working on a multicore architecture codenamed larrabee which may compete with our products in various markets intel may also release an enthusiast level discrete gpu based on the larrabee architecture additionally in fiscal year 2009 intel also introduced the intel atom processor which is designed for lower cost pcs intel may also release a second generation of atom chips by 2010 which is expected to have an improved battery life the intel atom processor may compete with our products that support netbooks pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices 

 

  our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally we expect that intel and amd will extend this strategy to other segments including the possibility of successfully integrating a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

 

  if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete for example in the case of our cpb our tegra and goforce products primarily compete in architecture used in multimedia cellular phones and handheld devices we believe that mobile devices like phones music players and portable navigation devices will increasingly become more consumer pclike and be capable of delivering all the entertainment and web experiences in a handheld device we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any of the new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer 

 

  our gpu and mcp products are currently used with both intel and amd processors in february 2009 intel filed suit against us related to a patent license agreement that we signed with intel in 2004 intel seeks an order from the court declaring that the license does not extend to a new intel processor architecture and enjoining us from stating that we have licensing rights for this architecture if intel successfully obtains such a court order we could be unable to sell our mcp products for use with these intel processors and our competitive position would be harmed in addition in order to continue to sell mcp products for use with these intel processors we could be required to negotiate a new license agreement with intel and we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

  

  

  

patents and proprietary rights 

 

  we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our issued patents have expiration dates from april 10 2009 to october 1 2028 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

 

  our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

    

    as of january 25 2009 we had 5420 employees 3772 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1648 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good 

financial information by business segment and geographic data 

    our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or codm reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we reorganized our operating segments we now report financial information for four operating segments to our codm the gpu business which is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook pcs plus memory products the psb which is comprised of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products including our nvidia tesla highperformance computing products the mcp business which is comprised of nvidia nforce core logic and motherboard gpu products and our cpb which is comprised of our tegra and goforce mobile brands and products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices cpb also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices in addition to these operating segments we have the “all other” category that includes human resources legal finance general administration and corporate marketing expenses which total 3461 million 2662 million and 2396 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively that we do not allocate to our other operating segments as these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our codm “all other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous reporting segments that are neither individually reportable nor aggregated with another operating segment revenue in the “all other” category is primarily derived from sales of components certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal year 

 

  our codm does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis operating segments do not record intersegment revenue and accordingly there is none to be reported the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for nvidia as a whole the information included in note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k including financial information by business segment and revenue and longlived assets by geographic region is hereby incorporated by reference

  global economic conditions have reduced demand for our products adversely impacted our customers and suppliers and harmed our business 

 

  our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business as consumers and businesses have postponed spending in response to tighter credit negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which have reduced the demand for our products other factors that could depress demand for our products in the future include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors have reduced demand for our products and could further harm our business financial condition and operating results 

 

  the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances for example during fiscal year 2009 we recorded impairment charges of 56 million related to our money market investment in the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or the international reserve fund the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

 

  our business is cyclical in nature and is currently experiencing a severe downturn which has harmed and may continue to harm our financial results 

 

  our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is currently experiencing a severe downturn the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the current global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors during this downturn are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer 

 

  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

 

  demand for many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses sales general and administrative expenses and restructuring and other charges represented 36 25 and 28 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter as was the case in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses and restructuring and other charges represented 66 of our total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

  

  

  in september 2008 we announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result we eliminated approximately 360 positions worldwide or about 65 of our global workforce during fiscal year 2009 expenses associated with the workforce reduction which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments to these employees totaled 80 million we anticipate that the expected decrease in operating expenses from this action will be offset by continued investment in strategic growth areas in addition in response to the current economic environment we have commenced several cost reduction measures which are designed to reduce our operating expenses and will continue to focus on reducing our operating expenses during fiscal year 2010 please refer to the discussion in note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for the potential impact of the tender offer on operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 

 

  any one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

 

  our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

 

  we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize the current negative worldwide economic conditions and market instability makes it increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include 

 

 

 

 

 

  any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

  conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products our third party manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

  because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

 

  we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 our gross margin declined to 294 as compared to 457 during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and decreased from 410 from the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin additionally during fiscal year 2009 the revenue and gross margins from our sale of desktop products decreased primarily due to a decline in the standalone desktop market segment as reported in the december 2008 pc graphics report from mercury research this decline was driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products if the overall shift in the demand from the consumer continues to shift towards lower priced products it will have an adverse impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

 

  we are dependent on the personal computer market and its rate of growth in the future may have a negative impact on our business 

 

  we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop personal computer or pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products these changes in demand could be large and sudden during fiscal year 2009 sales of our desktop gpu products decreased by approximately 29 compared to fiscal year 2008 these decreases were primarily due to the standalone desktop gpu market segment decline as reported in the pc graphics december 2008 report from mercury research since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

  if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results could be adversely impacted 

 

  the market for gpus mcps and computeronachip products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interface or apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share we believe other factors impacting our ability to compete are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

  a significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and computeronachip products that support netbooks pnds pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes currently intel corporation or intel which has greater resources than we do is working on a multicore architecture codenamed larrabee which may compete with our products in various markets intel may also release an enthusiast level discrete gpu based on the larrabee architecture additionally in fiscal year 2009 intel also introduced the intel atom processor which is designed for lower cost pcs intel may also release a second generation of atom chips by 2010 which is expected to have an improved battery life the intel atom processor may compete with our products that support netbooks pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices 

 

  our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

    

  if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete for example in the case of our cpb our tegra and goforce products primarily compete in architecture used in multimedia cellular phones and handheld devices we believe that mobile devices like phones music players and portable navigation devices will increasingly become more consumer pclike and be capable of delivering all the entertainment and web experiences in a handheld device we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any of the new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer 

 

  our gpu and mcp products are currently used with both intel and amd processors in february 2009 intel filed suit against us related to a patent license agreement that we signed with intel in 2004 intel seeks an order from the court declaring that the license does not extend to a new intel processor architecture and enjoining us from stating that we have licensing rights for this architecture if intel successfully obtains such a court order we could be unable to sell our mcp products for use with these intel processors and our competitive position would be harmed in addition in order to continue to sell mcp products for use with these intel processors we could be required to negotiate a new license agreement with intel and we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

 

  as intel and amd continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

 

  we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally we expect that intel and amd will extend this strategy to other segments including the possibility of successfully integrating a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

 

  if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

 

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results for example in july 2008 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation media and communications processor or mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to the risk entitled “ we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business” for the risk associated with this litigation 

  

  

  

  we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

 

  we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states we generated 87 89 and 86 of our revenue for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 25 2009 we had offices in fifteen countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

 

  our international operations in australia china finland france germany hong kong india japan korea russia singapore sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

  the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

 

  if our products do not continue to be adopted by the desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing netbook personal media player or pmp personal digital assistant or pda cellular handheld device and video game console markets or if the demand for new and innovative products in these markets decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

 

  our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3d graphics and multimedia in desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing netbooks pmps pdas cellular handheld devices and video game console applications the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our gpu and mcp businesses together comprised approximately 75 79 and 77 of our revenue during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as such our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus or mcps do not continue to achieve widespread adoption by the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of new products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing netbook pmp pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

  additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers oems odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 

 

  our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products or entry into or development of a new market is delayed or unsuccessful 

 

  in order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products as well as identify and enter new markets as our gpus and other processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline in particular average selling prices and gross margins for our gpus and other processors could decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices our gross margin and our financial results we believe the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors outlined elsewhere in these risk factors as well as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  in the past we have experienced delays in the development and adoption of new products and have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory 

 

  to be successful we must also enter new markets or develop new uses for our future or existing products we cannot accurately predict if our current or existing products or technologies will be successful in the new opportunities or markets that we identify for them or that we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter for example we have developed products and other technology in order for certain generalpurpose computing operations to be performed on a gpu rather than a cpu this general purpose computing which is often referred to as gp computing was a new use for the gpu which had been entirely used for graphics rendering during fiscal year 2008 we introduced our nvidia tesla family of products which was our entry into the highperformance computing industry a new market for us we also offer our cuda software development solution which is a c language programming environment for gpus that allows parallel computing on the gpu by using standard c language to create programs that process large quantities of data in parallel some of our competitors including intel are now developing their own solutions for the discrete graphics and computing markets our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new gpus other products or other technologies or to enter into new markets or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to suffer 

 

  if we are unable to achieve design wins our products may not be adopted by our target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

  the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers’ new system configurations this requires that we 

 

 

 

 

  if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

 

  our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers like amd intel and microsoft corporation or microsoft if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers’ product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

 

  we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

  if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase we had 3772 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 25 2009 compared to 3255 employees as of january 27 2008 and 2668 employees as of january 28 2007 respectively research and development expenditures were 8559 million 6916 million and 5535 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively research and development expenses included stockbased compensation expense of 980 million 766 million and 701 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could further decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 

 

  we are dependent on key employees and the loss of any of these employees could negatively impact our business 

 

  our future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the semiconductor industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our other key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

 

  in september 2008 we reduced our global workforce by approximately 65 as part of our efforts to allow continued investment in strategic growth areas this reduction in our workforce may impair our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees of our workforce as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions employees whether or not directly affected by the reduction may also seek future employment with our business partners customers or competitors in addition we rely on stockbased awards as one means for recruiting motivating and retaining highly skilled talent if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations the significant decline in the trading price of our common stock has resulted in the exercise price of a significant portion of our outstanding options to significantly exceed the current trading price of our common stock thus lessening the effectiveness of these stockbased awards we may not continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would harm our business 

 

  we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

 

  we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management’s attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products our ability to sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted the significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

 

  we are exposed to credit risk fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

 

  we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates future declines in the market values of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary 

 

  at january 25 2009 and january 27 2008 we had 126 billion and 181 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities given the global nature of our business we have invested both domestically and internationally all of our investments are denominated in united states dollars we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 25 2009 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities as of january 25 2009 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 71 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 17 of our total investment portfolio 

 

  the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances for instance we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of 99 million during fiscal year 2009 these charges include 56 million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund 25 million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and 18 million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january 25 2009 please refer to note 17 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further details subsequent to yearend on january 30 2009 we received 844 million from the international reserve fund this was our portion of a payout of approximately 65 of the total assets of the fund each shareholder’s percentage of this distribution was determined by dividing the shareholder’s total unfunded redeemed shares by the aggregate unfunded redeemed shares of the fund which was then used to calculate the shareholder’s pro rata portion of this distribution we expect to receive the proceeds of our remaining investment in the international reserve fund excluding the 56 million that we have recorded as an other than temporary impairment by no later than october 2009 when all of the underlying securities held by the international reserve fund are scheduled to have matured however redemptions from the international reserve fund are currently subject to pending litigation which could cause further delay in receipt of our funds in addition we may determine that further impairment of our investment in the international reserve fund may be necessary 

risks related to our partners and customers 

 

  we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

 

  we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any minimum quantity of product at any time or at any set price except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

 

  because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

 

  failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

 

  manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

 

  we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery schedule product quantity or product quality 

 

  our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co siliconware precision industries co ltd and chippac as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin and revenue to decline 

 

  failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect our operating results and gross margin 

 

  we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we believe this strategy will help us remain competitive our current product families are manufactured using 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer 65 nanometer and 55 nanometer process technologies manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin 

 

  we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our thirdparty manufacturers to invest sufficient funds in new manufacturing techniques in order to have ample capacity for all of their customers and to develop the techniques in a timely manner our product cycles may also depend on our thirdparty manufacturers migrating to smaller geometry processes successfully and in time for us to meet our customer demands some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly or more successfully than our manufacturing partners for example intel has released a 45 nanometer chip for desktop computers which it is manufacturing in its foundries in addition in october 2008 amd and the advanced technology investment company a technology investment company backed by the government of abu dhabi announced the establishment of a us headquartered semiconductor manufacturing company that will manufacture amd’s advance processors if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted if we are forced to use larger geometric processes in manufacturing a product than our competition our gross margin may be reduced the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

 

  we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

 

  we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

 

  because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

 

  we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers 

 

  we have a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 aggregate sales to customers in excess of 10 of our total revenue accounted for approximately 11 of total revenue from one customer and approximately 10 and 12 of our total revenue from another customer respectively although a small number of our other customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of original equipment manufacturers or oems and system integrators throughout the world who in many cases specify the graphics supplier our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key contract equipment manufacturers or cems original design manufacturers or odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms addin board manufacturers and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us or if we were unable to collect accounts receivable from them our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

  

  

  

  any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable including from foreign customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

  our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 38 of our accounts receivable balance from three customers at january 25 2009 and approximately 12 of our accounts receivable balance from one customer at january 27 2008 

 

  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters 

 

  we are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products which if determined adversely to us could harm our business 

 

  during the second fiscal quarter of 2009 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage which provided us with 8 million in related reimbursement during fiscal year 2009 however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 

 

  in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

 

  the ongoing civil actions or any new actions relating to the market for gpus could adversely affect our business 

 

  in november 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to gpus and cards in october 2008 the doj formally notified us that the doj investigation had been closed no specific allegations were made against nvidia during the investigation 

 

  several putative civil complaints were filed against us by direct and indirect purchasers of gpus asserting federal antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and ati technologies ulc or ati and advanced micro devices inc or amd as a result of its acquisition of ati the indirect purchasers’ consolidated amended complaint also asserts a variety of state law antitrust unfair competition and consumer protection claims on the same allegations as well as a common law claim for unjust enrichment 

 

  in september 2008 we executed a settlement agreement or the agreement in connection with the claims of the certified class of direct purchaser plaintiffs the agreement is subject to court approval and if approved would dispose of all claims and appeals raised by the certified class in the complaints against nvidia in addition in september 2008 we reached a settlement agreement with the remaining individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs that provides for a dismissal of all claims and appeals related to the complaints raised by the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs this settlement is not subject to the approval of the court while we expect the courts to approve the settlement agreement with the direct purchasers there can be no assurance that it will approved if the settlement agreement is not approved we may be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed on us that could harm our business in addition additional parties may bring claims against us relating to the potential antitrust violations related to gpus and cards if additional claims are brought against us such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

 

  the matters relating to the board of director’s review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have resulted in litigation which could harm our financial results 

 

  in august 2006 we announced that the audit committee of our board with the assistance of outside legal counsel was conducting a review of our stock option practices covering the time from our initial public offering in 1999 our fiscal year 2000 through june 2006 the audit committee reached the conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods as a result we recorded additional noncash stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects related to stock option grants ten derivative complaints were filed in state and federal court pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants in september 2008 we entered into memoranda of understanding regarding the settlement of the stockholder derivative lawsuits in november 2008 the definitive settlement agreements were concurrently filed in the chancery court of delaware and the united states district court northern district of california and are subject to approval by both such courts the settlement agreements do not contain any admission of wrongdoing or fault on the part of nvidia our board of directors or executive officers while we expect the courts to approve the settlement agreements there can be no assurance that they will approved if the settlement agreements are not approved we may be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed on us that could harm our business 

 

  we are a party to other litigation including patent litigation which if determined adversely to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

 

  we are a party to other litigation as both a defendant and as a plaintiff for example we are engaged in litigation with intel corporation rambus corporation and with various parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further detail on these lawsuits there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

 

  litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

 

  we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement 

 

  an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

 

  in addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

 

  if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties’ patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

 

  we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

 

  government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties and could result in litigation against us 

 

  in the past we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the doj and the sec we may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future which may lead to enforcement actions fines or other penalties 

 

  in addition litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency for example following the announcement of the doj investigation several putative civil complaints were filed against us in addition following our audit committee’s investigation and the sec’s investigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices ten derivative complaints were filed in state and federal court pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants please refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding these lawsuits such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

 

  we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

 

  in fiscal year 2009 we used approximately 1838 million of our cash to purchase real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

 

  since inception we have used equity through our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us 

 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r    sharebased payment which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments sfas no 123r requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards stockbased compensation expense resulting from our compliance with sfas no 123r was 1627 million 1334 million and 1167 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively which negatively impacted our operating results additionally on february 11 2009 we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options the tender offer commenced on february 11 2009 and expired at 1200 midnight pacific time on march 11 2009 as of january 25 2009 there were approximately 331 million options eligible to participate in the tender offer if all these options were tendered and accepted in the offer the aggregate cash purchase price for these options would be approximately 920 million as a result of the tender offer we may incur a nonrecurring charge of up to approximately 1500 million if all of the unvested eligible options are tendered this charge would be reflected in our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2010 and represents stockbased compensation expense consisting of the remaining unamortized stockbased compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the eligible options tendered in the offer stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options if any plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees we are currently tallying information on the number of options tendered under the offer to determine the actual aggregate cash to be paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options and the nonrecurring charge to be incurred pertaining to the unvested eligible options that have been tendered we believe that sfas no 123r will continue to negatively impact our operating results 

 

  to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

 

  we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units for example during the twelve months ended january 25 2009 our market capitalization declined from approximately 14 billion to approximately 4 billion estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

 

  our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses 

 

  our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance 

 

  in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities for example following our announcement in july 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2009 the trading price of our common stock declined in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us relating to this announcement please refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding these lawsuits due to changes in the potential volatility of our stock price we may be the target of securities litigation in the future such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   

 

  our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

 

  we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

 

  our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

 

  we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products for example we are subject to the european union directive on restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive that restricts the use of a number of substances including lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the european union we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august 15 2005 

 

  it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages delays or excess noncompliant inventory may occur as a result of the rohs directive weee and other domestic or international environmental regulations failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including costs fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability to conduct business in the countries or states that have adopted these types of regulations 

 

  while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline   

 

  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies’ internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

  changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

 

  we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

 

  provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control   

 

  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

  3dfx 

 

  on december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate 

 

  landlord lawsuits 

 

  in may 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s san jose california commercial real estate lease carlyle fortran trust or carlyle in december 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s austin texas commercial real estate lease carramerica realty corporation or carramerica the landlords both asserted claims for among other things interference with contract successor liability and fraudulent transfer the landlords sought to recover damages in the aggregate amount of approximately 15 million representing amounts then owed on the 3dfx leases the cases were later removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california when 3dfx filed its bankruptcy petition and consolidated for pretrial purposes with an action brought by the bankruptcy trustee 

 

  in 2005 the us district court for the northern district of california withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court for the landlords’ actions and on november 10 2005 granted our motion to dismiss both landlords’ complaints the landlords filed amended complaints in early february 2006 and nvidia again filed motions to dismiss those claims on september 29 2006 the district court dismissed the carramerica action in its entirety and without leave to amend on december 15 2006 the district court also dismissed the carlyle action in its entirety both landlords filed timely notices of appeal from those orders 

 

on july 17 2008 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit held oral argument on the landlords appeals on november 25 2008 the court of appeals issued its opinion affirming the dismissal of carlyle’s complaint in its entirety the court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of most of carramerica’s complaint but reversed the district court’s dismissal of carramerica’s claims for interference with contractual relations and fraud on december 8 2008 carlyle filed a request for rehearing en banc  which carramerica joined that same day carlyle also filed a motion for clarification of the court’s opinion on january 22 2009 the court of appeals denied the request for rehearing en banc  but clarified its opinion affirming dismissal of the claims by stating that carramerica had standing to pursue claims for interference with contractual relations fraud conspiracy and tort of another and remanding carlyle’s case with instructions that the district court evaluate whether the trustee had abandoned any claims which carlyle might have standing to pursue 

the district court held a status conference in the carramerica and carlyle cases on march 9 2009 that same day 3dfx’s bankruptcy trustee filed in the bankruptcy court a notice of trustee’s intention to compromise controversy with carlyle fortran trust according to that notice the trustee would abandon any claims it has against us for intentional interference with contract negligent interference with prospective economic advantage aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty declaratory relief unfair business practices and tort of another in exchange for which carlyle will withdraw irrevocably its proof of claim against the 3dfx bankruptcy estate and waive any further right of distribution from the estate in light of the trustee’s notice the district court ordered the parties to seek a hearing on the notice on or before april 24 2009 ordered carlyle and carramerica to file amended complaints by may 10 2009 and set a further case management conference for may 18 2009 we continue to believe that there is no merit to carlyle or carramerica’s remaining claims 

 

  trustee lawsuit 

 

  in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate served his complaint on nvidia the trustee’s complaint asserts claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 70 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 50 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and was therefore responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities this action was consolidated for pretrial purposes with the landlord cases as noted above 

 

  on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 108 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustee’s request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 108 million 

 

  in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

 

  on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

 

  on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidia’s favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court where the appeal is pending 

 

  while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustee’s case still remains pending appeal as such we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million  56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx – that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee’s case we do not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

 

  the equity committee lawsuit 

 

  on december 8 2005 the trustee filed a form 8k on behalf of 3dfx disclosing the terms of the conditional settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor’s committee thereafter certain 3dfx shareholders filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interests of 3dfx shareholders the court granted that petition and appointed an equity securities holders’ committee or the equity committee the equity committee thereafter sought and obtained an order granting it standing to bring suit against nvidia for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate to compel nvidia to pay the stock consideration then unpaid from the apa and filed its own competing plan of reorganizationliquidation the equity committee’s plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be used to retire all of 3dfx’s debts and thus to trigger nvidias obligation to pay six million shares of stock consideration specified in the apa nvidia contends among other things that such a commitment is not sufficient and that its obligation to pay the stock consideration had long before been extinguished on may 1 2006 the equity committee filed its lawsuit for declaratory relief to compel nvidia to pay the stock consideration in addition the equity committee filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd an equity investment fund that conditionally agreed to pay no more than 515 million for preferred stock in 3dfx the hearing on that motion was held on january 18 2007 and the bankruptcy court approved the proposed protections 

 

  after the bankruptcy court denied our motion to dismiss on september 6 2006 the equity committee again amended its complaint and nvidia moved to dismiss that amended complaint as well on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court granted the motion as to one of the equity committee’s claims and denied it as to the others however the bankruptcy court also ruled that nvidia would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which the equity committee seeks determinations that 1 the apa was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection 2 the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the apa and 3 the apa is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy estate 

 

  because of the trial of the trustees fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia the equity committees lawsuit did not progress substantially in 2007 on july 31 2008 the equity committee filed a motion for summary judgment on its first three causes of action on september 15 2008 nvidia filed a crossmotion for summary judgment on october 24 2008 the court held a hearing on the parties’ crossmotions for summary judgment on january 6 2009 the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum decision granting nvidia’s motion and denying the equity committee’s motion and entered an order to that effect on january 30 2009 on february 27 2009 the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of nvidia the equity committee has waived its right to appeal by stipulation entered on february 18 2009 and the judgment is now final 

 

  proceedings sec inquiry and lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices 

 

  in june 2006 the audit committee of the board of nvidia audit committee began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management the audit committee with the assistance of outside legal counsel completed its review on november 13 2006 when the audit committee reported its findings to our full board the review covered option grants to all employees directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in january 1999 through june 2006 based on the findings of the audit committee and our internal review we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes 

 

  we voluntarily contacted the sec regarding the audit committee’s review in late august 2006 the sec initiated an inquiry related to our historical stock option grant practices in october 2006 we met with the sec and provided it with a review of the status of the audit committee’s review in november 2006 we voluntarily provided the sec with additional documents we continued to cooperate with the sec throughout its inquiry on october 26 2007 the sec formally notified us that the secs investigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices had been terminated and that no enforcement action was recommended 

 

  concurrently with our internal review and the sec’s inquiry since september 29 2006 ten derivative cases have been filed in state and federal courts asserting claims concerning errors related to our historical stock option granting practices and associated accounting for stockbased compensation expense these complaints have been filed in various courts including the california superior court santa clara county the united states district court for the northern district of california and the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county the california superior court cases were subsequently consolidated as were the cases pending in the northern district of california all of the cases purport to be brought derivatively on behalf of nvidia against members of our board and several of our current and former officers and directors plaintiffs in these actions allege claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment insider selling abuse of control gross mismanagement waste and constructive fraud the northern district of california action also alleges violations of federal provisions including sections 10b and 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the plaintiffs seek to recover for nvidia among other things damages in an unspecified amount rescission punitive damages treble damages for insider selling and fees and costs plaintiffs also seek an accounting a constructive trust and other equitable relief 

 

  on august 5 2007 our board authorized the formation of a special litigation committee to investigate evaluate and make a determination as to how nvidia should proceed with respect to the claims and allegations asserted in the underlying derivative cases brought on behalf of nvidia the special litigation committee has made substantial progress in completing its work but has not yet issued a report 

  between june 2007 and september 2008 the parties to the actions engaged in settlement discussions including four mediation sessions before the honorable edward infante ret on september 22 2008 we disclosed that we had entered into memoranda of understanding regarding the settlement of all derivative actions concerning our historical stock option granting practices on november 10 2008 the definitive settlement agreements were concurrently filed in the chancery court of delaware and the united states district court for the northern district of california and are subject to approval by both such courts the settlement agreements do not contain any admission of wrongdoing or fault on the part of nvidia our board of directors or executive officers the terms of the settlement agreements include among other things the agreement by the board of directors to continue and to implement certain corporate governance changes acknowledgement of the prior amendment of certain options through repricings and limitations of the relevant exercise periods an agreement by jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer to amend additional options to increase the aggregate exercise price of such options by 35 million or to cancel options with an intrinsic value of 35 million an 80 million cash payment by our insurance carrier to nvidia and an agreement to not object to attorneys’ fees to be paid by nvidia to plaintiffs’ counsel of no more than 725 million if approved by the courts on january 24 2009 a notice of pendency and settlement of shareholder derivative actions was mailed to shareholders of record and posted on wwwnvidiacom  on march 11 2009 a final settlement hearing was held in the delaware chancery court and on the same date the court entered a final order and judgment which approved the requested attorneys fees and dismissed the delaware action with prejudice the final approval hearing in the northern district of california is scheduled for march 17 2009 

  department of justice subpoena and investigation and civil cases 

 

  on november 29 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to gpus and cards on october 10 2008 the doj formally notified us that the doj investigation has been closed no specific allegations were made against nvidia during the investigation 

 

  as of january 25 2009 over 50 civil complaints have been filed against us the majority of the complaints were filed in the northern district of california several were filed in the central district of california and other cases were filed in several other federal district courts on april 18 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the actions currently pending outside of the northern district of california to the northern district of california for coordination of pretrial proceedings before the honorable william h alsup by agreement of the parties judge alsup will retain jurisdiction over the consolidated cases through trial or other resolution 

 

  in the consolidated proceedings two groups of plaintiffs one putatively representing all direct purchasers of gpus and the other putatively representing all indirect purchasers filed consolidated amended classaction complaints these complaints purport to assert federal antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and ati technologies ulc or ati and advanced micro devices inc or amd as a result of its acquisition of ati the indirect purchasers’ consolidated amended complaint also asserts a variety of state law antitrust unfair competition and consumer protection claims on the same allegations as well as a common law claim for unjust enrichment 

 

  plaintiffs filed their first consolidated complaints on june 14 2007 on july 16 2007 we moved to dismiss those complaints the motions to dismiss were heard by judge alsup on september 20 2007 the court subsequently granted and denied the motions in part and gave the plaintiffs leave to move to amend the complaints on november 7 2007 the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file amended complaints ordered defendants to answer the complaints lifted a previously entered stay on discovery and set a trial date for january 12 2009 plaintiffs filed motions for class certification on april 24 2008 we filed oppositions to the motions on may 20 2008 on july 18 2008 the court ruled on plaintiffs’ class certification motions the court denied class certification for the proposed class of indirect purchasers the court granted in part class certification for the direct purchasers but limited the direct purchaser class to individual purchasers that acquired graphics processing cards products directly from nvidia or ati from their websites between december 4 2002 and november 7 2007 

 

  on september 16 2008 we executed a settlement agreement or the agreement in connection with the claims of the certified class of direct purchaser plaintiffs approved by the court pursuant to the agreement nvidia has paid 850000 into a 17 million fund to be made available for payments to the certified class we are not obligated under the agreement to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees costs or make any other payments in connection with the settlement other than the payment of 850000 the agreement is subject to court approval and if approved would dispose of all claims and appeals raised by the certified class in the complaints against nvidia a final settlement approval hearing is scheduled for march 26 2009   because the court certified a class consisting only of a narrow group of direct purchasers the agreement does not resolve any claims that other direct purchasers may assert in addition on september 9 2008 we reached a settlement agreement with the remaining individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs pursuant to which nvidia paid 112500 in exchange for a dismissal of all claims and appeals related to the complaints raised by the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs this settlement is not subject to the approval of the court pursuant to the settlement the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the complaints have dismissed their claims and withdrawn their appeal of the class certification ruling because the court did not certify a class of indirect purchasers this settlement agreement resolves only the claims of those indirect purchasers that were named in the various actions

recent developments future objectives and challenges 

 

  gpu business 

 

  our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook pcs plus memory products during fiscal year 2009 we launched several new gpus in the geforce family including the geforce 9600 gt the geforce 9800 gx2 and the geforce 9800 gtx we also launched the geforce gtx 280 and 260 gpu products which represent the second generation of our unified architecture and based on a variety of benchmarks and resolutions deliver approximately 50 percent more gaming performance than our geforce 8800 ultra gpu we also launched the geforce gtx 295 and geforce gtx 285 which were designed based on compute unified device architecture or cuda technology the geforce gtx 295 is among the world’s fastest dual gpu solutions featuring the power of two geforce gtx 200 gpus on a single card the geforce gtx 285 is among the world’s most powerful single gpu solution and works efficiently in complex directx 10 environments with extreme hd resolutions we also shipped notebook products from the geforce 100m series which includes the geforce g105m and the geforce g110m to meet the performance demands of today’s visual computing applications the geforce g105m is over 55 percent faster than our previous product in its segment while the geforce g110m is 35 percent faster than our previous mainstream gpu 

 

  in fiscal year 2009 we completed our acquisition of ageia technologies inc or ageia an industry leader in gaming physics technology we believe that the combination of the gpu and physics engine brands results in an enhanced visual experience for the gaming world subsequent to our acquisition of ageia we launched the geforce 9800 gtx geforce 9800 gt and geforce 9500 gt gpus which provide support for our physx physics engine and cuda parallel processing across a wide range of price segments 

 

  our share of the standalone desktop gpu category decreased from 64 to 63 in fiscal year 2009 according to the december 2007 and december 2008 pc graphics report from mercury research respectively our share of the standalone notebook category decreased from 75 to 63 according to the december 2007 and december 2008 pc graphics report from mercury research respectively due to increased competition in the marketplace during fiscal year 2009 our revenue from desktop gpu products declined approximately 29 compared to fiscal year 2008 this decline was driven primarily as a result of a decline of over 20 in the number of units of desktop gpu products that we sold while average selling prices of our desktop gpu products were flat to slightly lower in fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 we believe that some portion of the decline in our desktop gpu unit sales reflects a shift in consumer preference towards notebook pcs and away from desktop pcs and that the overall global economic recessionary climate also contributed to the decline as such we noted that unit sales of our notebook gpu products increased over 10 during fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 however the overall global economic recessionary climate contributed to a significant decline in the demand for total graphics during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 if consumer preferences towards notebook pcs and away from desktop pcs continue or escalate we may see further declines in sales of our desktop gpu products in addition if the global economic climate does not recover during fiscal year 2010 or deteriorates further we may see consumer preferences move towards lowerpriced notebook pcs which may negatively impact sales of our notebook pc products

  our cpb is comprised of our tegra and goforce mobile brands and products that support netbooks pmps pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices this business also includes license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices 

 

  during fiscal year 2009 we launched the nvidia tegra apx 2500 computeronachip in february 2009 we announced the nvidia tegra apx 2600 computeronachip and that we have worked closely with google inc or google and the open handset alliance to utilize android an open mobile phone software stack with the nvidia tegra series during fiscal year 2009 we also launched the nvidia tegra 600 and 650 products which are small advanced highlyintegrated visual computeronachip products these products feature enhanced multimedia functionality and deliver many times the power efficiency of competing products 

  we also introduced geforce 3d vision a highdefinition 3d stereo solution for the home 3d vision is a combination of hightech wireless glasses a highpower infrared emitter and advanced software that transforms hundreds of pc games into full stereoscopic 3d 

  restructuring charges 

  on september 18 2008 we announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result we eliminated approximately 360 positions worldwide or about 65 of our global workforce during fiscal year 2009 expenses associated with the workforce reduction which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments to these employees totaled 80 million we anticipate that the expected decrease in operating expenses from this action will be offset by continued investment in strategic growth areas 

  product defect 

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  in july 2008 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems all of our newly manufactured products and all of our products that are currently shipping in volume have a different material set that we believe is more robust 

 

  the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the mcp and gpu products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

  we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage which provided us with 80 million in related reimbursement during fiscal year 2009 however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products     

  

  

  

  in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation 

 

  common stock 

 

  at the annual meeting of stockholders held on june 19 2008 our stockholders approved an increase in our authorized number of shares of common stock to 2000000000 the par value of our common stock remained unchanged at 0001 per share 

dependence on pc market 

  we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products changes in demand for our products could be large and sudden during fiscal year 2009 sales of our desktop gpu products decreased approximately 29 compared to fiscal year 2008 these decreases were primarily due to the standalone desktop and standalone notebook gpu market segment decline as reported in the pc graphics december 2008 report from mercury research since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

seasonality 

  our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand this seasonal trend did not occur in fiscal year 2009 revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2009 declined by 33 when compared to revenue from the first half of fiscal year 2009 the current recessionary economic environment has created substantial uncertainty in our business there can be no assurance that the historical seasonal trend will resume in the future 

 

subsequent event 

  tender offer 

  on february 11 2009 we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options the tender offer commenced on february 11 2009 and expired at 1200 midnight pacific time on march 11 2009 the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than 1750 per share none of the nonemployee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section 16a of the securities exchange act of 1934 including our former chief financial officer marvin d burkett were eligible to participate in the offer all eligible options with exercise prices less than 2800 per share but not less than 1750 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 300 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option all eligible options with exercise prices greater than 2800 per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of 200 per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 

 

we use equity to promote employee retention and provide an incentive vehicle valued by employees that is also aligned to stockholder interest however our stock price has declined significantly over the past year and all of our eligible options are “outofthemoney” ie have exercise prices above our stock price therefore we provided an incentive to employees with an opportunity to obtain cash payment for their eligible options also the tender offer is expected to increase the number of shares available for issuance under our 2007 equity incentive plan to the extent eligible options were tendered in this tender offer the tender offer is also expected to reduce the potential dilution to our stockholders that is represented by outstanding stock options which become additional outstanding shares of our common stock upon exercise 

 

  as of january 25 2009 there were approximately 331 million options eligible to participate in the tender offer if all these options were tendered and accepted in the offer the aggregate cash purchase price for these options would be approximately 920 million as a result of the tender offer we may incur a nonrecurring charge of up to approximately 1500 million if all of the unvested eligible options are tendered this charge would be reflected in our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2010 and represents stockbased compensation expense consisting of the remaining unamortized stockbased compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the eligible options tendered in the offer stockbased compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options if any plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees 

 

  we are currently tallying information on the number of options tendered under the offer to determine the actual aggregate cash to be paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options and the nonrecurring charge to be incurred pertaining to the unvested eligible options that have been tendered  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors or board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  revenue recognition 

 

  product revenue   

 

  we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

 

  our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to purchasers of our products we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 0109 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 

 

  our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf 0109 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting our products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

 

  we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

  license and development revenue   

 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

  accounts receivable 

 

  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy for example one customer accounted for approximately 18 of our accounts receivable balance at january 25 2009 and we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen such as the current period when the worldwide economy is experiencing a downturn the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our financial results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2009 

  as of january 25 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 11 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 3368 million of the 3368 million 945 million was covered by credit insurance and 53 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 01 and 03 during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively as of january 25 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented the high end of this range at 03 of our gross accounts receivable balance 

 

  inventories 

  

  inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results for example during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 we recorded new inventory writedowns of approximately 500 million which was approximately five to ten times higher than the level of inventory reserves we recorded during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2009 reflecting a significant decline in our forecasted future demand for the related products this increased level of inventory reserves had a negative impact on our gross margin and our results of operations if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold however sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped as of january 25 2009 our inventory reserve was 869 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 78 and 139 during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 as of january 25 2009 our inventory reserve represented the high end of this range at 139 of our gross inventory balance 

  warranty liabilities 

  cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers’ costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  in july 2008 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems the mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 

  determining the amount of the 1960 million charge related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs however if actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

  income taxes 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

 

  united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 

 

  our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

 

  as of january 25 2009 we had a valuation allowance of 925 million of the total valuation allowance 53 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes and 872 million relates to state and foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes morelikelythannot recognition of these acquired tax benefits would be reported as a reduction to income tax expense in accordance with the recent accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards no 141r or sfas no 141r business combinations  issued by the fasb in december 2007 we would also recognize an income tax benefit during the period that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to state or foreign tax benefits of 872 million becomes morelikelythannot 

 

  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r share based payment  our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 5887 million as of january 25 2009 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to do a withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

 

  on january 29 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 or fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes issued in july 2006 fin 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 109 under fin 48 we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position the cumulative effect of adoption of fin 48 did not result in a material adjustment to our tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense did not change as a result of implementing the fin 48 please refer to note 13 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for additional information 

 

  goodwill 

 

  our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments or components of an operating segment for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fair valuebased approach we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and concluded that there was no impairment this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization the estimate of cash flow is based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units in addition determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain the longterm financial forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable however actual performance in the nearterm and longerterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with such tests 

  cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  fair value 

    

  in the current market environment the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined and the rapid changes occurring in today’s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time statement of financial accounting standards no 157 or sfas no 157 fair value measurements establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets level 1 valuations are obtained from realtime quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets level 2 valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets level 3 valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value while most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs the valuation of our holdings of the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund are classified as a level 3 input due to the inherent subjectivity and the significant judgment involved in its valuation total financial assets at fair value classified within level 3 were 37 of total assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 25 2009 

 

    other than t emporary i mpairment 

 

  we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary when the resulting fair value is significantly below cost basis andor the significant decline has lasted for an extended period of time the evaluation that we use to determine whether a marketable security is impaired is based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment which include the consideration of general market conditions the duration and extent to which fair value is below cost and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for an investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and changes in an investee’s credit rating investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value during fiscal year 2009 we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of 99 million these charges include 56 million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the international reserve fund 25 million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and 18 million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january 25 2009 

 

  stockbased compensation 

 

  effective january 30 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r  which establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period stockbased compensation expense recognized during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 was 1627 million 1334 million and 1167 million respectively which consisted of stockbased compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan please refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information 

 

  we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 123r beginning january 30 2006 we recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

 

  using the binomial model the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended january 25 2009 

 

 

 

for our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the blackscholes model the fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended january 25 2009 

 

 

 

  sfas no 123r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

  

  

  

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

 

  from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

 

results of operations 

 

  the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

fiscal years ended january 25 2009 january 27 2008 and january 28 2007 

 

revenue 

 

  we report financial information for four major productline operating segments to our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker as follows the gpu business psb mcp business and cpb revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of components please refer to note 16 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information 

 

    fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008   

 

  revenue was 342 billion for fiscal year 2009 compared to 410 billion for fiscal year 2008 which represents a decrease of 16 for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect revenue to remain flat or improve slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business    gpu business revenue decreased by 24 to 191 billion for fiscal year 2009 compared to 252 billion for fiscal year 2008 this decrease resulted from decreased sales of our desktop gpu and memory products offset by increased sales of our notebook gpu products sales of our desktop gpu and memory products decreased approximately 29 and 59 respectively in fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 these decreases were primarily due to a decline in the standalone desktop market segment as reported in the december 2008 pc graphics report from mercury research driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products this overall market decline translated into a decline of over 20 in the number of units of desktop gpu products that we sold in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 the decline in desktop gpu revenue also reflects the impact of a slight average sales price regression in our products and a decline in our share position during the middle portion of fiscal year 2009 as a result of increased competition memory sales declined as a result of a decline in sales of our highend desktop gpu products sales of our notebook gpu products increased approximately 3 in fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 due to higher unit sales aided by a market move toward notebook pcs over desktop pcs offset by a slight decline in average selling prices additionally the overall global economic recessionary climate contributed to a significant decline in the demand for total graphics during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 

psb psb revenue increased by 18 to 6934 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 5884 million for fiscal year 2008 our nvidia professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall unit increase of approximately 15 in shipments of boards and chips as compared to fiscal year 2008 due to strong demand and our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce 8based and geforce 9based products sales of nvidia quadro cx for adobe’s cs4 software which we launched in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 also contributed towards the increase in sales in fiscal year 2009 

 

  mcp business  mcp business revenue decreased by 8 to 6556 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 7104 million for fiscal year 2008 this decrease was due to a decline of approximately 32 in sales of our amdbased platform products resulting from increased competition in amdbased products offset by an increase of approximately 120 in sales of our intelbased platform products the increase in intelbased product sales was driven by sales of our geforce 9400m mgpu which we launched in october 2008 along with apple inc or apple for their new lineup of mac notebooks and our new geforce 9400 and 9300 mgpus for intel desktop pcs 

 

  cpb  cpb revenue decreased by 46 to 1363 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 2511 million for fiscal year 2008 the decline in cpb revenue is primarily driven by a combination of a decrease in revenue from our cell phone products and a decrease in revenue from sony computer entertainment or sce the decrease in revenue from our cell phone products resulted from our shift from marketing and developing legacy products to achieving design wins and marketing our newer tegra products the decrease in our revenue from sce resulted from a decline in license revenue and a decline in royalty revenue that was caused by a lower number of units shipped as well as by a stepdown in the per unit royalty rate during the year due to achievement of a unitbased milestone in our agreement with sce 

  fiscal year 2008 vs fiscal year 2007   

 

  revenue was 410 billion for fiscal year 2008 compared to 307 billion for fiscal year 2007 which represents an increase of 34 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

  gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 47 to 252 billion in fiscal year 2008 compared to 171 billion in fiscal year 2007 this improvement was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop gpu products and notebook gpu products sales of our desktop gpu products increased by approximately 38 compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to growth of the standalone desktop market as reported in the december 2007 pc graphics report from mercury research our leadership position in the standalone desktop market was driven by our geforce 8based products sales of our notebook gpu products increased by approximately 114 compared to fiscal year 2007 notebook gpu revenue growth was primarily due to share gains in the standalone notebook category as reported in the december 2007 pc graphics report from mercury research our share gains in the standalone notebook category were primarily a result of shipments of products used in notebook pc design wins related to intel’s santa rosa platform used in notebooks 

 

  psb  psb revenue increased by 29 to 5884 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 4547 million in fiscal year 2007 our professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall increase in shipments of boards and chips this increase in shipments was primarily driven by our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce 8based products 

 

  mcp business  mcp business revenue increased by 7 to 7104 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 6615 million in fiscal year 2007 the increase resulted from an approximate 225 increase in sales of our intelbased platform products as compared to fiscal year 2007 we began ramping up shipments of our intelbased platform products after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our amdbased platform products and sales of products related to our acquisition of uli electronics inc in february 2006 

 

  cpb   cpb revenue increased by 8 to 2511 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 2332 million in fiscal year 2007 the overall increase in cpb revenue is primarily due to increased royalties from sony computer entertainment or sce but was offset by decreases in revenue from our cell phone products and our contractual development arrangements with sce 

 

    concentration of revenue   

 

  we generated 87 89 and 86 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers or cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

 

  revenue from significant customers those representing approximately 10 or more of total revenue for the respective periods is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

  gross profit and gross margin 

 

  gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements 

  gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 343 456 and 424 for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy therefore if we experience product transition or competitive challenges if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines our gross margin may be negatively impacted 

  we will continue to focus on improving our gross margin by delivering cost effective product architectures enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

    fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008 

 

  our gross margin declined to 343 in fiscal year 2009 from 456 for fiscal year 2008 the gross margin for fiscal year 2009 includes the impact of a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems offset by allocated insurance claim proceeds of 67 million from an insurance provider this warranty charge had an adverse impact of approximately 60 on our gross margin for fiscal year 2009 additionally inventory reserves taken during fiscal year 2009 were approximately 500 million higher compared to fiscal year 2008 reflecting a significant decline in our forecasted future demand for the related products and having a negative impact on our gross margin 

  gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business decreased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this decrease was due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation gpu products used in notebook systems the negative impact of inventory reserves taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and average sales price regression in our geforce 9based and previous generations of desktop products resulting from increased competition the average sales price regression was also driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products 

  psb  the gross margin of our psb increased slightly during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 9based nvidia quadro products which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and geforce 8based nvidia quadro products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 

  mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 due to decline in the margins of our amd and intelbased products during fiscal year 2009 gross margins declined primarily due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp products used in notebook systems 

  cpb  the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 this increase was primarily due to changes in the product mix in our cpb product lines we experienced greater revenue decline in our lower margin cell phone and other handheld devices product lines as compared to higher margin sce transactions in the current year 

  

  

  

    fiscal year 2008 vs fiscal year 2007   

  gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 8series gpus which began selling in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 our geforce 8series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus additionally the more favorable costs of memory purchases during fiscal year 2008 positively impacted our gross margin 

  psb  the gross margin of our psb increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 8based nvidia quadro products which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 

  mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards intelbased platform products which began to ramp up shipments after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 of approximately 41 million related to certain nvidia nforce purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 

  cpb  the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this decrease was primarily due to a drop in gross profit realized from sales of our highend feature cellular phone and other handheld devices however increased royalties from sce during fiscal year 2008 offset the decreases 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

  research and development 

 

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008   

  research and development expenses were 8559 million and 6916 million during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively an increase of 1643 million or 24 the increase was primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 649 million primarily as a result of the net addition of approximately 500 personnel in departments related to research and development functions offset by lower expenses during fiscal year 2009 related to our variable compensation programs when compared to fiscal year 2008 stockbased compensation expense increased by 214 million primarily because of the impact of new hire and semiannual stock awards granted subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 offset by a reduction in expense related to older stock awards that were almost fully vested and for which the related expense had been almost fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 development expenses increased by 188 million primarily due to increase in expenses related to engineering services prototype materials and internal board requests other increases in research and development expenses are primarily related to costs that were driven by personnel growth including depreciation and amortization facilities and computer software and equipment 

 

  fiscal year 2008 vs fiscal year 2007   

 

    research and development expenses were 6916 million and 5535 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 1381 million or 25 the increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 953 million as a result of personnel growth in departments related to research and development functions by approximately 600 additional personnel in fiscal year 2008 additionally salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008 facilities expenses and expenses related to computer software and equipment also increased as a result of the personnel growth 

 

    in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

  sales general and administrative 

  

  fiscal year 2009 vs fiscal year 2008 

  sales general and administrative expenses were 3622 million and 3413 million during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively an increase of 209 million or 6 outside professional fees increased by 175 million primarily due to increased legal fees pertaining to ongoing litigation matters described in note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k marketing and advertising expenses increased by 223 million primarily due to increased advertising campaign related activities and trade shows in the current year depreciation and amortization expense increased by 154 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired from our acquisitions of mental images and ageia and from increased capital expenditures stockbased compensation expense increased by 69 million primarily due to the impact of new hire and semiannual stock awards granted subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 offset by a reduction in expense related to older stock awards that were almost fully vested and for which the related expense had been almost fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 headcount related to personnel in departments related to sales general and administrative functions remained relatively flat yearoveryear but labor and related expenses decreased by 139 million due to lower expenses during fiscal year 2009 related to our variable compensation programs when compared to fiscal year 2008 

 

    fiscal year 2008 vs fiscal year 2007   

  sales general and administrative expenses were 3413 million and 2935 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 478 million or 16 the increase is primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 314 million related to the growth in personnel by approximately 180 additional personnel additionally salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008 advertising and promotion expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to costs incurred for sponsorships and increased advertising campaign costs the increase in personnel during the year and the expansion of our facilities worldwide to support additional personnel resulted in increases in our facilities expenses stockbased compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses 

  

  in response to the current economic environment we have commenced several cost reduction measures which are designed to reduce our operating expenses and will continue to focus on reducing our operating expenses during fiscal year 2010 please refer to the discussion in note 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for the potential impact of the tender offer on operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 

 

  inprocess research and development

  restructuring charges and other 

    on september 18 2008 we announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result we eliminated approximately 360 positions worldwide or about 65 of our global workforce during fiscal year 2009 expenses associated with the workforce reduction which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments to these employees totaled 80 million we anticipate that the expected decrease in operating expenses from this action will be offset by continued investment in strategic growth areas 

  restructuring and other expenses also included a nonrecurring charge of 189 million associated with the termination of a development contract related to a new campus construction project that has been put on hold 

  

  

  

 

interest income and interest expense 

 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income decreased to 429 million in fiscal year 2009 from 643 million in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the result of lower average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and lower interest rates in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 interest income increased to 643 million in fiscal year 2008 from 418 million in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

other income expense net 

  other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation other income expense was 147 million and 08 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively a decrease of 155 million this decrease was primarily due to other than temporary impairment charges of 99 million that we recorded during fiscal year 2009 these charges include 56 million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund 25 million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and 18 million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january 25 2009 please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further discussion other income expense was 08 million and 08 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 15 million the increase in other income during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 is primarily due to approximately 20 million of realized gains on sale of an investment offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses in fiscal year 2008   

 

income taxes 

 

  we recognized income tax expense benefit of 129 million 1037 million and 464 million during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively income tax expense benefit as a percentage of income loss before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 300  in fiscal year 2009 115 in fiscal year 2008 and 94 in fiscal year 2007 

 

  the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax with the additional impact of the federal research tax credit recognized in fiscal year 2009 relative to the loss before taxes in such fiscal year

  during fiscal year 2005 we announced that our board of directors or board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock subject to certain specifications up to an aggregate maximum amount of 300 million during fiscal year 2007 the board further approved an increase of 400 million to the original stock repurchase program in fiscal year 2008 we announced a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to an additional 10 billion of our common stock over a three year period through may 2010 on august 12 2008 we announced that our board further authorized an additional increase of 10 billion to the stock repurchase program as a result of these increases we have an ongoing authorization from the board subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of 27 billion through may 2010 

 

  the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

  during the three months ended january 25 2009 we did not enter into any structured share repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal year 2009 we entered into structured share repurchase transactions to repurchase 293 million shares for 4236 million which we recorded on the trade date of the transactions through fiscal year 2009 we have repurchased an aggregate of 909 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 146 billion as of january 25 2009 we are authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an additional amount of 124 billion through may 2010 

  

  

  

  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

 

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

 

 

 

 

 

  we expect to spend approximately 200 million to 250 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2010 primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

 

  for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business and industry  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations ” 

  

  3dfx asset purchase 

  on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa which closed on april 18 2001 to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx under the terms of the apa the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx one million shares which due to subsequent stock splits now totals six million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 

 

  in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought among other things payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

 

  on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007 

  on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidia’s favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court where the appeal is pending 

  while the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustee’s case still remains pending appeal as such we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million  56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx – that we recorded during the three months ended october 30 2005 pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee’s case we do not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

  product defect 

  our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

  in july 2008 we recorded a 1960 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems all of our newly manufactured products and all of our products that are currently shipping in volume have a different material set that we believe is more robust 

 

  the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the mcp and gpu products in their notebook system designs we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 

  we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage which provided us with 80 million in related reimbursement during fiscal year 2009 however there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 

  determining the amount of the 1960 million charge related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs however if actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 

 

  in september october and november 2008 several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding this litigation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

 

  as of january 25 2009 and january 27 2008 we had 126 billion and 181 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 25 2009 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars 

 

  we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

 

  as of january 25 2009 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 44 million 

 

  the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them for instance we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of 99 million during fiscal year 2009 these charges include 56 million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the reserve international liquidity fund ltd or international reserve fund 25 million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and 18 million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january 25 2009 please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for further details as of january 25 2009 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 71 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 17 of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities with the substantial majority of the securities rated aaaa3 or better if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments by approximately 2563 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

  we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 was 20 million 17 million and 05 million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

 

  we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 25 2009

    in fiscal year 2008 we completed our acquisition of mental images an industry leader in photorealistic rendering technology mental images’ mental ray product is considered by many to be the most pervasive ray tracing renderer in the industry mental images visualization technology is embedded in most major digital content creation or dcc and computer aided design or cad applications and their rendering technology is deployed by major manufacturers and film studios we believe that this strategic combination will enable the development of tools and technologies that will advance the state of visualization will be optimized for next generation computing architectures and will create new product categories for both hardware and software 

      mcp business 

 

    our mcp business is comprised of nvidia nforce core logic and nvidia geforce mgpu products our nvidia nforce and geforce mgpu families of products address the multibillion dollar computer core logic market core logic is the computer’s “central nervous system” controlling and directing high speed data between the central processing unit or cpu the gpu storage and networks high quality longterm reliability and top performance are key customer demands of core logic suppliers our strategy for mcps aligns with what we anticipate will drive growth in the mcp segment such as multicore everincreasingspeed networking and storage technologies and integration of complex features such as virtualization security processing and network processing during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we shipped our first singlechip mgpus for intelprocessorbased desktop pcs we believe that the geforce 7000 mgpu family delivers the performance of an entrylevel discrete gpu when compared against traditional integrated graphics solutions we also shipped the geforce 7050 mgpu which targets the lower cost categories of the market we are now the only chipset supplier to support processor platforms created by both intel corporation or intel and advanced micro devices inc or amd and the only branded integrated gpu supplier for the intel processor platform we believe that the integrated graphics opportunity represents approximately 60 of the world pc market we also extended the reach of scalable link interface or sli technology into the performance category with the launch of our nvidia nforce 650i sli 680i lt sli and 680i ultra mcp products for intel we are now the second largest core logic supplier in the world with 15 segment share of the total core logic market according to the mercury research 2007 fourth quarter pc chipsets and processors report 

  in fiscal year 2008 we announced a new technology named hybrid sli we named it hybrid because this technology combines a powerful as well as an energyefficient engine and sli because it is our multigpu technology when geforce addin graphics cards are connected to geforce mgpus hybrid sli kicks in combining their processing power to deliver an improved experience the technology is application aware so depending on the processing demands of each application running on the host pc the discrete gpu may be completely shutdown in order to save power for example a pc containing the combined power of dual geforce 8800 gtx sli addin graphics cards can reach 400 watts if such a pc contained hybrid sli technology both gpus could be powered down when the user is doing email surfing the web or watching a bluray movie keeping the system quiet and consuming lower levels of energy but when a video game or any other demanding gpu application is launched the dual geforce 8800 gtx’s would be powered up to deliver the performance required to power the related application hybrid sli was made available starting with our geforce8series mgpus 

  our mcp strategy is to bring the benefits of geforce gpus to the most price sensitive categories while creating exciting platform architectures like sli hybrid sli and enthusiast system architecture or esa esa is a standard for system information protocol that links a pc system’s various critical components – such as fan power supply smart chassis gpus and motherboards it enables a unified architecture for applications and users to control and optimize the performance of their system sli hybrid sli and esa are examples of how nvidia creates architectures that advance the capabilities of the pc

  use our expertise in digital multimedia  we believe the synergy created by the combination of 3d graphics hd video and the internet will fundamentally change the way people work learn communicate and play we believe that our expertise in hd graphics and system architecture positions us to help drive this transformation we are using our expertise in the processing and transmission of highbandwidth digital media to develop products designed to address the requirements of highbandwidth concurrent multimedia 

  use our intellectual property and resources to enter into license and development contracts from time to time we expect to enter into license arrangements that will require significant customization of our intellectual property components for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for example in fiscal year 2006 we entered into an agreement with sony computer entertainment inc or sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce’s playstation3 our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation3 and all derivatives including nextgeneration digital consumer electronics devices in addition we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce 

sales and marketing 

  our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and applications processors that support pmps pdas cellular phones and other handheld devices our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving the channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

  in the gpu and mcp segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the cpb segment we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system builders 

  although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to our largest customer asustek computer inc accounted for 10 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2008 

  to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain of our products available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

  our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

 

seasonality 

  our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market due to the seasonality in this market we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the backtoschool and holiday seasons 

manufacturing 

  we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

 

  we utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc united microelectronics corporation or umc chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered semiconductor manufacturing international corporation or smic and austria micro systems or ams to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering or ase amkor technology or amkor jsi logistics ltd or jsi king yuan electronics co ltd or kyec siliconware precision industries company ltd or spil and stats chippac incorporated or chippac to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products 

  we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

inventory and working capital 

    our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

research and development 

    

    we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power communications storage and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and our consumer products that support pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

 

    a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

  we substantially increased our engineering and technical resources in fiscal year 2008 and have 3255 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 27 2008 compared to 2668 employees as of january 28 2007 the majority of the research and development employees added during fiscal year 2008 are located in international locations including india china taiwan and various locations in europe during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 we incurred research and development expenditures of 6916 million 5535 million and 3571 million respectively research and development expenses included 766 million 701 million and 59 million related to noncash stockbased compensation for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

competition 

  the market for gpus mcps and application processors that support pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interface or apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

 

      a significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and application processors that support pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes currently intel which has greater resources than we do is working on a multicore architecture codenamed larrabee which may compete with our products in various markets intel may also release an enthusiast level discrete gpu based on the larrabee architecture 

    our current competitors include the following 

  ·   suppliers of discrete mcps that incorporate a combination of networking audio communications and inputoutput or io functionality as part of their existing solutions such as amd broadcom corporation or broadcom silicon integrated systems inc or sis via technologies inc or via and intel 

  ·   suppliers of gpus including mcps that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as amd intel matrox electronics systems ltd sis and via 

  ·   suppliers of application processors that support pmps pdas cellular phones or other handheld devices intellectual property such as amd broadcom fujitsu limited imagination technologies ltd arm holdings plc marvell technology group ltd or marvell nec corporation qualcomm incorporated renesas technology samsung seikoepson texas instruments incorporated and toshiba america inc and 

  ·   suppliers of application processors for handheld and embedded devices that incorporate multimedia processing as part of their existing solutions such as broadcom texas instruments inc qualcomm incorporated marvell freescale semiconductor inc renesas technology samsung and st microelectronics 

 

    we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally we expect that intel and amd will extend this strategy to other segments including the possibility of successfully integrating a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

 

    if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer 

 

 

patents and proprietary rights 

  we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our issued patents have expiration dates from october 29 2008 to may 24 2027 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

 

employees 

  as of january 27 2008 we had 4985 employees 3255 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1730 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good 

financial information by business segment and geographic data 

 

our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or codm reviews financial information presented on a operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we reorganized our operating segments we now report financial information for four operating segments to our codm the gpu business which is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook pcs plus memory products the psb which is comprised of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products including our nvidia tesla highperformance computing products the mcp business which is comprised of nvidia nforce core logic and motherboard gpu products and our cpb which is comprised of our goforce and apx mobile brands and products that support handheld pmps pdas cellular phones other handheld devices and license royalty other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices in addition to these operating segments we have the “all other” category that includes human resources legal finance general administration and corporate marketing expenses which total 2662 million 2396 million and 1238 million during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively that we do not allocate to our other operating segments as these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our codm “all other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous reporting segments that are neither individually reportable nor aggregated with another operating segment revenue in the “all other” segment is primarily derived from sales of components all relevant prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal year 

our codm does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis operating segments do not record intersegment revenue and accordingly there is none to be reported the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for nvidia as a whole the information included in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements is hereby incorporated by reference

 item 1a  risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to competition 

if we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results could be adversely impacted 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand from our products and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable prices and quality levels we believe other factors impacting our ability to compete are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products either of which could harm our business some of these competitors may have or be able to obtain greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be better able to adapt to customer or technological changes currently intel which has greater resources than we do is working on a multicore architecture codenamed larrabee which may compete with our products in various markets intel may also release an enthusiast level discrete gpu based on the larrabee architecture in order to compete we may have to invest substantial amounts in research and development without assurance that our products will be superior to those of our competitors or that the products will achieve market acceptance 

an additional significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide competing product solutions for example we are the largest supplier of amd 64 chipsets with 60 segment share in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2007 as reported in the 2007 fourth quarter pc processor and chipset report from mercury research decline in demand for our chipsets in the amd segment as a result of the offerings of a new or existing competitor could materially impact our financial results 

our current competitors include the following 

 

 

  

  

 

 

if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer 

as intel and amd continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution amd has also announced a platform solution additionally we expect that intel and amd will extend this strategy to other segments including the possibility of successfully integrating a central processing unit or cpu and a gpu on the same chip as evidenced by amd’s announcement of its fusion processor project if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

risks related to our partners and customers 

we depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead industryleading foundries manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of the foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any minimum quantity of product at any time or at any set price except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 

because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand 

 

  

  

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation 

manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery schedule and quantity of our products 

our products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc amkor technology jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co siliconware precision industries co ltd and chippac as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin and revenue to decline 

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect our operating results and gross margin 

we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we believe this strategy will help us remain competitive our current product families are manufactured using 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer and 65 nanometer process technologies manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly than our manufacturing partners for example intel recently released a 45 nanometer chip for desktop computers which it is manufacturing in its foundries if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

  

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results 

because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

  we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose   any of these customers 

we have a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2008 12 of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007 and 26 of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006 although a small number of our other customers represents the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of original equipment manufacturers or oems and system integrators throughout the world who in many cases specify the graphics supplier our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading personal computer or pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key contract equipment manufacturers or cems original design manufacturers or odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us or we were unable to collect accounts receivable from them our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

  

  

any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable including from foreign customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 

 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy two customers accounted for approximately 21 and 23 of our accounts receivable balance at january 27 2008 and january 28 2007 respectively 

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 

risks related to our business and products 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results 

our inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts or orders from our customers and may not accurately predict the quantity or type of products that our customers will want or will ultimately end up purchasing in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of the value of our inventory andor a reduction in average selling prices and where our gross margin could be adversely affected include 

 

 

 

 

conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products our third party manufacturing partners may not have adequate capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business 

  

  

because we order products or materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to lower than expected demand is limited 

we manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial results 

our business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts are unsuccessful 

in the past we have experienced delays in the development of new products any delay or failure of our gpus our other products or other technologies to meet or exceed specifications of our customers or competitive products could materially harm our business if customers do not buy our products the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new processors or other technologies could impact our revenue gross margin and other financial results 

our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or to develop new products could harm our business 

as our gpus and other processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices and our gross margin in order for our processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our processors for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion additionally we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ odms’ or addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 

  

  

as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition products or technologies developed by others may render our processors noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory which would harm our business 

if we are unable to achieve design wins our products may not be adopted by our target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers are an integral part of our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers’ new system configurations this requires that we 

 

 

 

 

 

if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins 

 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers like advanced micro devices inc or amd intel and microsoft corporation or microsoft if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers’ product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

  

  

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase we have increased our engineering and technical resources and had 3255 2668 and 1654 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 27 2008 january 28 2007 and january 29 2006 respectively research and development expenditures were 6916 million 5535 million and 3571 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively research and development expenses included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 766 million and 701 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively related to noncash stock based compensation which we began to record in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123r if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive which may include entering new markets we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as hiring additional employees 

if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share 

our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures when first introduced or when we release new versions or enhancements past products have and future products or enhancements may contain defects errors or bugs our products typically only go through one verification cycle prior to volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain undetected defects or flaws prior to volume production and distribution if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and gross margin additionally an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation or result in our customers working with our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

 

we continue to pursue improved gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business we may not be able to take action in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management’s attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products our ability to sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

  

  

we are dependent on key employees and the loss of any of these employees could negatively impact our business 

our future success and ability to compete is substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the semiconductor industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of these employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may not be able to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 25 28 and 24 of our total revenue during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively operating expenses included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1225 million and 1085 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively related to noncash stock based compensation which we began to record in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment  since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls further some of our operating expenses like noncash stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results would be negatively impacted 

expensing employee stock options materially and adversely affects our reported operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us as a result of adjustments arising from our restatement related to stock option grant dates our operating results for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2007 contain recorded amounts of stockbased compensation expense for our fiscal years 2000 through 2006 this stockbased compensation expense was calculated using primarily the intrinsic valuebased method under accounting principles board opinion no 25 or apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments sfas no 123r requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards during the fiscal years 2008 and 2007 we recorded 1334 million and 1167 million respectively related to noncash stockbased compensation resulting from our compliance with sfas no 123r which negatively impacted our operating results we believe that sfas no 123r will continue to negatively impact our operating results 

to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

  

  

we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating results 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operations 

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our stock could decline 

 

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period 

any one or more of the risks discussed in this form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year 

as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

risks related to market conditions 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

 

at january 27 2008 and january 28 2007 we had 181 billion and 112 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 27 2008 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

 

  

  

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

recent us subprime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets causing global credit and liquidity issues the shortterm funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth quarter of calendar 2007 leading to liquidity disruption in the market if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results as of january 27 2008 we did not have any issuer concentration in excess of 10 of our investment portfolio however our investments in the financial sector and government agencies accounted for approximately 46 and 22 respectively of our total investment portfolio if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments by approximately 2254 million 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

 

we conduct our business worldwide our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states we generated 89 86 and 84 of total revenues for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas as of january 27 2008 we had offices in twelve countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

  

  

our international operations in australia taiwan japan korea china hong kong india france russia germany finland and the united kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks we intend to continue to expand our existing operations and expect to open other international offices difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

the economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 

if our products do not continue to be adopted by the desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing pmp pda cellular handheld devices and video game console markets or if the demand for new and innovative products in these markets decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3d graphics and multimedia in desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing pmp pda cellular handheld devices and video game console applications the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our gpu and mcp businesses together comprised of approximately 79 77 and 74 of revenue for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as such our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus or mcps do not continue to achieve widespread adoption by the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of new products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the desktop pc notebook pc workstation highperformance computing pmp pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results 

additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers oems odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 

we are dependent on the pc market and its rate of growth in the future may have a negative impact on our business 

we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales may reduce demand for our products these changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

  

  

our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints variations in manufacturing costs and yields significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry which can be unpredictable and rapid in an efficient and timely manner our operating results could suffer in particular from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand increased inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand increased inventories or decreased selling prices during a downturn our revenue and operating results will suffer 

risks related to regulatory and other legal matters 

the united states department of justice’s pending investigation into the market for graphics processors and the ongoing civil actions could adversely affect our business 

on november 29 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to gpus and cards no specific allegations have been made against us we are cooperating with the doj in its investigation 

as of march 5 2008 55 civil complaints have been filed against us the majority of the complaints were filed in the northern district of california several were filed in the central district of california and other cases were filed in several other federal district courts on april 18 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the actions currently pending outside of the northern district of california to the northern district of california for coordination of pretrial proceedings before the honorable william h alsup by agreement of the parties judge alsup will retain jurisdiction over the consolidated cases through trial or other resolution 

in the consolidated proceedings two groups of plaintiffs one representing all direct purchasers of graphic processing units or gpus and the other representing all indirect purchasers filed consolidated amended classaction complaints these complaints purport to assert federal antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and ati technologies inc or ati and amd as a result of its acquisition of ati the indirect purchasers’ consolidated amended complaint also asserts a variety of state law antitrust unfair competition and consumer protection claims on the same allegations as well as a common law claim for unjust enrichment 

plaintiffs filed their first consolidated complaints on june 14 2007 on july 16 2007 we moved to dismiss those complaints the motions to dismiss were heard by judge alsup on september 20 2007 the court subsequently granted and denied the motions in part and gave the plaintiffs leave to move to amend the complaints on november 7 2007 the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file amended complaints ordered defendants to answer the complaints lifted a previously entered stay on discovery and set a trial date for january 12 2009 discovery is underway and plaintiffs are currently required to file any motion for class certification by april 24 2008 we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases costs of defense and any damages resulting from a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our business 

  

  

the matters relating to the board’s review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have resulted in litigation which could harm our financial results 

on august 10 2006 we announced that the audit committee of our board with the assistance of outside legal counsel was conducting a review of our stock option practices covering the time from our initial public offering in 1999 our fiscal year 2000 through june 2006 the audit committee reached the conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods as a result we recorded additional noncash stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects related to stock option grants 

the audit committee’s review of our historic stock option practices identified a number of occasions on which the measurement date used for financial accounting and reporting purposes for stock options granted to certain of our employees was different from the actual grant date to correct these accounting errors we amended our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 29 2006 and our quarterly report on form 10q for the three months ended april 30 2006 to restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those reports this review of our historical stock option granting practices and subsequent restatement required us to incur substantial expenses for legal accounting tax and other professional services and diverted our management’s attention from our business 

additionally the review and the resulting restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation ten derivative complaints have been filed in state and federal court pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants we cannot assure you that these or future similar complaints or any future litigation or regulatory action will result in the same conclusions reached by the audit committee on august 5 2007 our board authorized the formation of a special litigation committee to investigate evaluate and make a determination as to how we should proceed with respect to the claims and allegations asserted in the underlying derivative cases brought on behalf of nvidia currently the special litigation committee’s review is ongoing the conduct and resolution of these matters will be time consuming expensive and could distract our management’s attention from the conduct of our business furthermore if we are subject to adverse rulings we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

in addition we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties’ patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

we are a party to litigation which if determined adversely to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

we are a party to litigation there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

  

  

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products for example we are subject to the european union directive on restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive that restricts the use of a number of substances including lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the european union we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august 15 2005 

it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages delays or excess noncompliant inventory may occur as a result of the rohs directive weee and other domestic or international environmental regulations failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including costs fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability to conduct business in the countries or states that have adopted these types of regulations 

  

  

  

while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline   

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and testing companies’ internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

 

  we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the securities and exchange commission or sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control   

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

    3dfx 

on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx which closed on april 18 2001 

    in may 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s san jose california commercial real estate lease carlyle fortran trust or carlyle in december 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s austin texas commercial real estate lease carramerica realty corporation the landlords’ complaints both asserted claims for among other things interference with contract successor liability and fraudulent transfer the landlords’ sought to recover money damages including amounts owed on their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately 15 million in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in january 2003 the landlords’ actions were removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california and consolidated for purposes of discovery with a complaint filed against nvidia by the trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case upon motion by nvidia in 2005 the district court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court for the landlords’ actions which were removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california the trustee’s lawsuit remained in the bankruptcy court on november 10 2005 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints and allowed the landlords until february 4 2006 to amend their complaints the landlords refiled claims against nvidia in early february 2006 and nvidia again filed motions requesting the district court to dismiss those claims on september 29 2006 the district court dismissed the carramerica action in its entirety and without leave to amend the district court found among other things that carramerica lacked standing to bring the lawsuit and that standing rests exclusively with the bankruptcy trustee on october 27 2006 carramerica filed a notice of appeal from that order on december 15 2006 the district court also dismissed the carlyle action in its entirety finding that carlyle also lacked standing to pursue its claims and that certain claims were substantively unmeritorious carlyle filed a notice of appeal from that order on january 9 2007 both landlords’ appeals are pending before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and briefing on both appeals has been consolidated nvidia has filed motions to recover its litigation costs and attorneys fees against both carlyle and carramerica the district court has postponed consideration of those motions until after the appeals are resolved 

in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate the trustee’s complaint asserts claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication on december 23 2005 the bankruptcy court denied the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustee’s request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement however the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

on december 21 2005 the bankruptcy court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property at the conclusion of the evidence the bankruptcy court asked the parties to submit posttrial briefing that briefing was completed on may 25 2007 and the bankruptcy court’s decision is still pending 

 

 

following the trustee’s filing of a form 8k on behalf of 3dfx in which the trustee disclosed the terms of the conditional settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor’s committee certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interests of 3dfx shareholders that petition was granted and an equity holders’ committee was appointed since that appointment the equity holders’ committee has filed a competing plan of reorganizationliquidation the equity holders’ committee’s plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be used to retire all of 3dfx’s debts the equity holders’ committee contends that the commitment by an investor to pay in equity capital is sufficient to trigger nvidias obligations under the apa to pay the stock consideration nvidia contends among other things that such a commitment is not sufficient and that its obligation to pay the stock consideration has been extinguished by virtue of stock splits since the execution of the apa the stock consideration would now total six million shares of nvidia common stock the equity holders’ committee filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking an order giving it standing to bring a lawsuit to obtain the stock consideration over our objection the bankruptcy court granted that motion on may 1 2006 and the equity holders’ committee filed its complaint for declaratory relief against nvidia that same day nvidia moved to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief and the bankruptcy court granted that motion with leave to amend the equity committee thereafter amended its complaint and nvidia moved to dismiss that amended complaint as well at a hearing on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court granted the motion as to one of the equity holders’ committee’s claims and denied it as to the others however the bankruptcy court also ruled that nvidia would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which the equity holders’ committee seeks a determination that the apa was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection that the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the apa and that the apa is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy estate because of the trial of the trustees fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia the equity committees lawsuit has not progressed substantially in 2007 the next status conference is not scheduled until july 31 2008 in addition the equity holders committee filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd an equity investment firm that has conditionally agreed to pay no more than 515 million for preferred stock in 3dfx the hearing on that motion was held on january 18 2007 and the bankruptcy court approved the proposed protections   

 

proceedings sec inquiry and lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices 

in june 2006 the audit committee of the board of nvidia or the audit committee began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management the audit committee with the assistance of outside legal counsel completed its review on november 13 2006 when the audit committee reported its findings to our full board the review covered option grants to all employees directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in january 1999 through june 2006 based on the findings of the audit committee and our internal review we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes 

 

we voluntarily contacted the sec regarding the audit committee’s review in late august 2006 the sec initiated an inquiry related to our historical stock option grant practices in october 2006 we met with the sec and provided it with a review of the status of the audit committee’s review in november 2006 we voluntarily provided the sec with additional documents we continued to cooperate with the sec throughout its inquiry on october 26 2007 the sec formally notified us that the secs investigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices had been terminated and that no enforcement action was recommended 

 

concurrently with our internal review and the sec’s inquiry since september 29 2006 ten derivative cases have been filed in state and federal courts asserting claims concerning errors related to our historical stock option granting practices and associated accounting for stockbased compensation expense these complaints have been filed in various courts including the california superior court santa clara county the united states district court for the northern district of california and the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county the california superior court cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on april 23 2007 plaintiffs in the delaware action filed an amended shareholder derivative complaint on february 12 2008 plaintiffs in the federal action filed a second amended consolidated verified shareholders derivative complaint on march 18 2008 all of the cases purport to be brought derivatively on behalf of nvidia against members of our board and several of our current and former officers and directors plaintiffs in these actions allege claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment insider selling abuse of control gross mismanagement waste and constructive fraud the northern district of california action also alleges violations of federal provisions including sections 10b and 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the plaintiffs seek to recover for nvidia among other things damages in an unspecified amount rescission punitive damages treble damages for insider selling and fees and costs plaintiffs also seek an accounting a constructive trust and other equitable relief we intend to take all appropriate action in response to these complaints between may 14 2007 and may 17 2007 we filed several motions to dismiss or to stay the federal delaware and santa clara actions the delaware motions were superseded when the delaware plaintiffs filed the amended shareholder derivative complaint on february 28 2008 the federal motions were superseded when the federal plaintiffs filed the second amended consolidated verified shareholders derivative complaint on march 18 2008 we have not yet responded to either of these complaints the santa clara motion to stay was denied without prejudice and the parties are currently engaged in discoveryrelated proceedings 

 

  on august 5 2007 our board authorized the formation of a special litigation committee to investigate evaluate and make a determination as to how nvidia should proceed with respect to the claims and allegations asserted in the underlying derivative cases brought on behalf of nvidia currently the special litigation committees investigation is ongoing 

  

  

 

  department of justice subpoena and investigation and civil cases 

 

on november 29 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to gpus and cards no specific allegations have been made against us we are cooperating with the doj in its investigation 

as of march 5 2008 55 civil complaints have been filed against us the majority of the complaints were filed in the northern district of california several were filed in the central district of california and other cases were filed in several other federal district courts on april 18 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the actions currently pending outside of the northern district of california to the northern district of california for coordination of pretrial proceedings before the honorable william h alsup by agreement of the parties judge alsup will retain jurisdiction over the consolidated cases through trial or other resolution 

in the consolidated proceedings two groups of plaintiffs one representing all direct purchasers of graphic processing units or gpus and the other representing all indirect purchasers filed consolidated amended classaction complaints these complaints purport to assert federal antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and ati technologies inc or ati and advanced micro devices inc or amd as a result of its acquisition of ati the indirect purchasers’ consolidated amended complaint also asserts a variety of state law antitrust unfair competition and consumer protection claims on the same allegations as well as a common law claim for unjust enrichment 

plaintiffs filed their first consolidated complaints on june 14 2007 on july 16 2007 we moved to dismiss those complaints the motions to dismiss were heard by judge alsup on september 20 2007 the court subsequently granted and denied the motions in part and gave the plaintiffs leave to move to amend the complaints on november 7 2007 the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file amended complaints ordered defendants to answer the complaints lifted a previously entered stay on discovery and set a trial date for january 12 2009 discovery is underway and plaintiffs are currently required to file any motion for class certification by april 24 2008 we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases

      during fiscal year 2008 we launched seven new quadro solutions including the quadro fx 370 and 570 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we expanded our nvidia quadro plex family with the introduction of the nvidia quadro plex vcs iv a new version of the nvidia quadro plex visual computing system or vcs which provides enhanced performance for a wide range of highperformance graphicsintensive styling and design oil and gas and scientific applications additionally in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we launched the nvidia quadro fx 4600 and nvidia quadro fx 5600 products which are professional solutions based on our geforce 8series unified architecture during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 we also introduced a new line of notebook workstation gpus the nvidia quadro fx 1600m 570m and 360m 

in fiscal year 2008 we also introduced nvidia tesla our entry into the highperformance computing industry tesla is a new family of gpu computing products that delivers processing capabilities for highperformance computing applications the tesla family consists of the c870 gpu computing processor the d870 deskside supercomputer and the s870 1u computing server 

in fiscal year 2008 we completed our acquisition of mental images an industry leader in photorealistic rendering technology mental images’ mental ray product is considered by many to be the most pervasive ray tracing renderer in the industry mental images visualization technology is embedded in most major digital content creation or dcc and computer aided design or cad applications and its rendering technology is deployed by major manufacturers and film studios we believe that this strategic combination will enable the development of tools and technologies that will advance the state of visualization will be optimized for next generation computing architectures and will create new product categories for both hardware and software 

mcp business 

 

  in fiscal year 2008 we announced a new technology named hybrid sli we named it hybrid because this technology combines a powerful as well as an energyefficient engine and of scalable link interface or sli because it is our multigpu technology the technology is application aware so depending on the processing demands of each application running on the host pc the discrete gpu may be completely shutdown in order to save power 

during fiscal year 2008 our nvidia nforce products held the leadership position for the amd segment as reported in the 2007 fourth quarter pc processor and chipsets report from mercury research 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we shipped our first singlechip motherboard gpus or mgpus for intelprocessorbased desktop pcs the geforce 7000 mgpu family delivers the performance of an entrylevel discrete gpu when compared against traditional integrated graphics solutions 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we shipped the geforce 7050 mgpu which targets the lower cost categories of the market 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we extended the reach of sli technology into the performance category with the launch of our nvidia nforce 650i sli 680i lt sli and 680i ultra mcp products for intel 

consumer products business 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we unveiled our first applications processor – the goforce 6100 the goforce 6100 is designed for next generation pmps and multimedia smart phones we began to ship the goforce 6100 during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 

 

  subsequent to fiscal year 2008 in february 2008 we launched the nvidia apx 2500 the apx 2500 is a computeronachip designed to meet the growing multimedia demands of todays mobile phone user the apx 2500 is the culmination of several hundred man years of research and development we believe that the mobile application processor is an area where we can add a significant amount of value and we also believe it represents a revenue growth opportunity 

  

  

gross margin improvement 

 

we continued to focus on improving our gross margin in fiscal year 2008 our gross margin was 456 for fiscal year 2008 an increase of 320 basis points from our gross margin of 424 for fiscal year 2007 

 

our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products that we earn revenue from during each of our fiscal periods product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy therefore if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines our gross margin may be negatively impacted we expect gross margin will be relatively flat to slightly up during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 

 

subsequent event 

property purchase 

  on february 14 2008 we closed escrow on a purchase of property that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings in santa clara california for approximately 1500 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable inventories income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors or board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k 

 

revenue recognition 

 

      product revenue 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

 

    our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 0109 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 

 

 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf 0109 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

 

license and development revenue 

 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

accounts receivable 

 

    we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2009 

    as of january 27 2008 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 10 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 6862 million of the 6862 million 1807 million was covered by credit insurance and 171 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 01 and 03 during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit as of january 27 2008 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 01 of our gross accounts receivable balance if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range at 03 of our gross receivable balance then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january 27 2008 would have been approximately 19 million rather than the actual balance of 10 million 

 

inventories 

  inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin as of january 27 2008 our inventory reserve was 329 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 84 and 135 during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 as of january 27 2008 our inventory reserve represented 84 of our gross inventory balance if our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range at 135 of our gross inventory balance then our inventory reserve balance at january 27 2008 would have been approximately 527 million rather than the actual balance of 329 million inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

  

  

income taxes 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

 

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

 

as of january 27 2008 we had a valuation allowance of 825 million of the total valuation allowance 47 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes and 778 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes morelikelythannot recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero then reduce other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense we would recognize an income tax benefit during the period that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes morelikelythannot 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r share based payment  our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 5641 million as of january 27 2008 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to do so on a withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

on january 29 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 or fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes issued in july 2006 fin 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 109 under fin 48 we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position the cumulative effect of adoption of fin 48 did not result in a material adjustment to our tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense did not change as a result of implementing the fin 48 please refer to note 13 of these notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information   

 

 

goodwill 

 

our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and concluded that there was no impairment determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain in addition we make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units the longterm financial forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable however actual performance in the nearterm and longerterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with such tests 

stockbased compensation 

 

  effective january 30 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r  which establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period stockbased compensation expense recognized during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 was 1334 million and 1167 million respectively which consisted of stockbased compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan please refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

  we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning january 30 2006 as provided by sfas no 123r we recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we recorded stockbased compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 or sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosures  

 

  at the beginning of fiscal year 2006 we transitioned from a blackscholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stockbased compensation awards granted under our stock option plans the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

 

using the binomial model the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended january 27 2008 

 

 

 

  for our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the blackscholes model the fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended january 27 2008 

 

 

sfas no 123r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

 

  from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 

 

 

results of operations 

    the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

fiscal years ended january 27 2008 january 28 2007 and january 29 2006 

 

revenue 

 

we report financial information for four major productline operating segments to our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker as follows the gpu business psb mcp business and cpb revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of components please refer to note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

    revenue was  410   b illion for fiscal year 2008 compared to  307 billion for fiscal year 2007 which represents an increase of 34    for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we expect a slight seasonal decline associated with the pc business although overall we believe our market and competitive position continues to be strong   a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 47 to 252 billion in fiscal year 2008 compared to 171 billion in fiscal year 2007 this improvement was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop gpu products and notebook gpu products sales of our desktop gpu products increased by approximately 38 compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to growth of the standalone desktop market as reported in the 2007 fourth quarter pc graphics report from mercury research our leadership position in the standalone desktop market was driven by our geforce 8based products sales of our notebook gpu products increased by approximately 114 compared to fiscal year 2007 notebook gpu revenue growth was primarily due to share gains in the standalone notebook category as reported in the 2007 fourth quarter pc graphics report from mercury research our share gains in the standalone notebook category were primarily a result of shipments of products used in notebook pc design wins related to intel’s santa rosa platform used in notebooks 

psb  psb revenue increased by 29 to 5884 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 4547 million in fiscal year 2007 our professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall increase in shipments of boards and chips this increase in shipments was primarily driven by our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce 8based products 

mcp business  mcp business revenue increased by 7 to 7104 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 6615 million in fiscal year 2007 the increase resulted from an approximate 225 increase in sales of our intelbased platform products as compared to fiscal year 2007 we began ramping up shipments of our intelbased platform products after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our amdbased platform products and sales of products related to our acquisition of uli electronics inc in february 2006 

 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 8 to 2511 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 2332 million in fiscal year 2007 the overall increase in cpb revenue is primarily due to increased royalties from sony computer entertainment or sce but was offset by decreases in revenue from our cell phone products and our contractual development arrangements with sce 

 

 

 

revenue was 307 billion for fiscal year 2007 compared to 238 billion for fiscal year 2006 which represents an increase of 29 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 21 to 171 billion for fiscal year 2007 compared to 141 billion for fiscal year 2006 the increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop and notebook products the increase in sales of our desktop products was led by our geforce 7based and geforce 8based products that serve the highend segment sales of our notebook products improved due to an increased mix of geforce 7based products shipping for notebook pc design wins based on intel’s napa platform this increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices 

psb  psb revenue increased by 21 to 4547 million in fiscal year 2007 compared to 3762 million in fiscal year 2006 our professional workstation product sales increased due to an increase in unit shipments offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices 

mcp business  mcp business revenue was 6615 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 3523 million for fiscal year 2006 which represents an increase of 88 the overall increase in mcp business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer nvidia nforce4 products nvidia nforce5 products integrated amdbased desktop products and integrated intelbased desktop products which began shipping after the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 in addition revenue also increased as a result of our acquisition of uli in february 2006 

 

cpb   cpb revenue increased by 1 to 2332 million in fiscal year 2007 compared to 2301 million in fiscal year 2006 the overall increase in cpb revenue is primarily due to increased unit sales of highend feature cellular phone and pda products as well as revenue recognized from our contractual development arrangements the increase in cpb revenue was offset by a decrease in sales of our xboxrelated products to microsoft we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 

 

 

 

we generated 89 86 and 84 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers or cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 

 

sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2008 12 of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007 and 26 of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006 

 

 

gross profit and gross margin 

 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements 

 

gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold our gross margin was 456 424 and 383 for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth 

our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy and thus if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines our gross margin may be negatively impacted we expect gross margin to remain relatively flat to slightly up during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 8series gpus which began selling in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 our geforce 8series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus additionally the more favorable costs of memory purchases during fiscal year 2008 positively impacted our gross margin 

psb  the gross margin of our psb increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 8based nvidia quadro products which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards intelbased platform products which began to ramp up shipments after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 of approximately 41 million related to certain nvidia nforce purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 this decrease was primarily due to a drop in gross profit realized from sales of our highend feature cellular phone and other handheld devices however increased royalties from sce during fiscal year 2008 offset the decreases 

 

 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the sale of our geforce 8series gpus and increased sales of our geforce 7 series gpus which collectively accounted for approximately 70 of our gpu business revenue our geforce 8 and our geforce 7 series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus 

 

psb  the gross margin of our psb increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce 7based nvidia quadro products which began to ramp up in sales during fiscal year 2007 and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated amdbased desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete mcp products and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 

cpb  the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to an increase in unit sales of highend feature cellular phone and pda products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous mobile products in addition license and royalty revenue from our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared to the gross margin of xbox products shipped in fiscal year 2006 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

    

  research and development 

 

fiscal year 2008 vs fiscal year 2007   

 

  research and development expenses were 6916 million and 5535 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 1381 million or 25 the increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 953 million as a result of personnel growth in departments related to research and development functions by approximately 600 additional personnel in fiscal year 2008 additionally salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008 facilities expenses and expenses related to computer software and equipment also increased as a result of the personnel growth 

 

fiscal year 2007 vs fiscal year 2006   

 

  research and development expenses were 5535 million and 3571 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively an increase of 1964 million or 55 the increase was primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 752 million as a result of personnel growth by approximately 1000 additional personnel additionally stockbased compensation increased by 642 million due to our adoption of sfas no 123r during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 facilities expenses and expenses related to computer software and equipment increased as a result of the increase in personnel inprocess research and development or iprd increased by 140 million as a result of our acquisitions of portalplayer and hybrid graphics during fiscal year 2007 other expenses increased primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of uli and hybrid graphics 

 

  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue

  sales general and administrative expenses were 3413 million and 2935 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 478 million or 16 the increase is primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 314 million related to the growth in personnel by approximately 180 additional personnel additionally salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008 advertising and promotion expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to costs incurred for sponsorships and increased advertising campaign costs the increase in personnel during the year and the expansion of our facilities worldwide to support additional personnel resulted in increases in our facilities expenses stockbased compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

fiscal year 2007 vs fiscal year 2006   

 

      sales general and administrative expenses were 2935 million and 2021 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively an increase of 914 million or 45 the increase is primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately 307 million related to approximately 200 additional personnel and an increase of 407 million related to stockbased compensation resulting from our adoption of sfas no 123r during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 the growth in personnel during the year resulted in an increase in facilities expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

  we expect operating expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 as a result of the impact of acquisitions we have recently completed and as a result of an increase in salaries and benefit expenses

interest income and interest expense 

 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income increased to 643 million in fiscal year 2008 from 418 million in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 interest income increased to 418 million in fiscal year 2007 from 207 million in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

  other income expense net 

  other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation other income expense increased to 08 million in fiscal year 2008 from 08 million in fiscal year 2007 the increase in other income during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 is primarily due to approximately 20 million of realized gains on sale of an investment offset by an increase in foreign currency translation losses in fiscal year 2008 

  income taxes 

 

  we recognized income tax expense of 1037 million 464 million and 556 million during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 115 in fiscal year 2008 94 in fiscal year 2007 and 156 in fiscal year 2006 

 

  the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax with the additional change in mix due to certain stockbased compensation expensed for financial accounting purposes under sfas no 123r and an increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal years 2008 and 2007

operating activities 

    operating activities generated cash of 127 billion 5727 million and 4464 million during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the cash provided by operating activities increased due to an increase in our net income during the comparable periods plus the impact of noncash charges to earnings and deferred income taxes during fiscal year 2008 noncash charges to earnings included stockbased compensation of 1334 million and depreciation and amortization on our longterm assets of 1332 million additionally operating cash flows for fiscal year 2008 also improved due to changes in operating assets and liabilities including the timing of payments to vendors and an improvement in inventory turnover these increases were offset by approximately 573 million in net cash outflows towards a confidential patent licensing agreement that we entered into in fiscal year 2007 

  the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our net income during the comparable periods plus the impact of noncash charges to earnings additionally the increase is related to the 1167 million of stockbased compensation expense recorded upon adoption of sfas no 123r in fiscal year 2007 and changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal years 2007 and 2006

  financing activities used cash of 3263 million 536 million and 614 million during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively net cash used by financing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to 5525 million paid towards our stock repurchase program offset by cash proceeds of 2260 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 27 2008 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax

recent us subprime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets causing global credit and liquidity issues the shortterm funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth quarter of calendar 2007 leading to liquidity disruption in the market if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results 

  

  

    stock repurchase program 

 

  during fiscal year 2005 we announced that our board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock subject to certain specifications up to an aggregate maximum amount of 300 million during fiscal year 2007 the board further approved an increase of 400 million to the original stock repurchase program in fiscal year 2008 we announced that our board authorized an additional stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to an additional 10 billion of our common stock over a three year period through may 2010 as a result of these increases we have an ongoing authorization from the board subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of 17 billion 

 

    the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with the exchange act rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement 

  during the fiscal year ended january 27 2008 we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase 189 million shares for 4994 million which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction in addition we repurchased 18 million shares for 531 million in the open market in privately negotiated transactions through january 27 2008 we had repurchased 617 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 104 billion 

  subsequent to january 27 2008 we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for 1239 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first quarter of fiscal year 2009 ending on april 27 2008 

  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

 

 

 

 

  our estimates for future capital expenditures include approximately 1500 million for a property that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings in santa clara california which we purchased on february 14 2008 in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

  for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business and products  our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our stock could decline” 

 

 

3dfx asset purchase 

 

  on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa which closed on april 18 2001 to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx under the terms of the apa the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx one million shares which due to subsequent stock splits now totals six million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 

 

  in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought among other things payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement however the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 

 

  on december 21 2005 the bankruptcy court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 70 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property at the conclusion of the evidence the bankruptcy court asked the parties to submit posttrial briefing that briefing was completed on may 25 2007 and the bankruptcy court’s decision is still pending

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate risk 

at january 27 2008 and january 28 2007 we had 181 billion and 112 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents assetbacked securities commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises equity securities money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 27 2008 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

 

  as of january 27 2008 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both  05 would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 31 million 

 

  recent us subprime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets causing global credit and liquidity issues the shortterm funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth quarter of calendar 2007 leading to liquidity disruption in the market if the global credit market continues to deteriorate our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results as of january 27 2008 we did not have any issuer concentration in excess of 10 of our investment portfolio however our investments in the financial sector and government agencies accounted for approximately 46 and 22 respectively of our total investment portfolio if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments by approximately 2254 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in “other income expense net” in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the aggregate exchange loss included in determining net income was 17 million in fiscal year 2008 and 05 million in fiscal year 2007 the impact of exchange gainloss was not material in fiscal year 2006 currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

 

we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january 27 2008

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and handheld gpus for pcs handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system integrators motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

in the gpu and mcp segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system integrators and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the handheld gpu segments we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our digital media processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world 

  as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to asustek computer inc or asustek a cem accounted for 12 of our total revenue for fiscal 2007 

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes products available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

seasonality 

our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market due to the seasonality in this market we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the backtoschool and holiday seasons 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered semiconductor manufacturing international corporation or smic taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc united microelectronics corporation or umc and american microsemiconductor or ams to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering or ase amkor technology or amkor king yuan electronics co ltd or kyec siliconware precision industries company ltd or spil and stats chippac incorporated or chippac to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system integrators or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

inventory and working capital 

  our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on this forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

research and development 

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power communications storage and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and handheld gpus application processors using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

we substantially increased our engineering and technical resources in fiscal 2007 and have 2668 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 28 2007 compared to 1654 employees as of january 29 2006 the majority of the research and development employees added during fiscal 2007 are located in international locations including india china taiwan and various locations in europe during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we incurred research and development expenditures of 5535 million 3571 million and 3482 million respectively research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 included 701 million related to noncash stockbased compensation net of associated payroll taxes which we began to record in fiscal 2007 as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment  

competition 

the market for gpus mcps and handheld gpus application processors is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs of addin boards or motherboards we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and handheld gpu solutions some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors include the following 

    

we expect substantial competition from intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products such as when intel achieved success with its centrino platform solution in addition to its current centrino notebook platform initiative and its announced upcoming desktop initiative branded as viiv we expect that intel is now focused on developing and selling platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and servers amd has also begun to focus on selling platform solutions if intel and amd continue to pursue these initiatives we may not be able to successfully compete in these segments 

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets our financial results will suffer 

 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our issued patents have expiration dates from september 4 2007 to december 8 2024 we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to technology used by us in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions the location in which our products are manufactured our strategic technology or product directions in different countries and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

as of january 28 2007 we had 4083 employees 2668 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1415 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good

available information 

our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act are available free of charge on or through our internet web site httpwwwnvidiacom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission or the sec our web site and the information contained therein as connected thereto is not intended to be incorporated into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involved some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to our operations 

 

the matters relating to the audit committee of the board of directors or the board review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have resulted in litigation which could harm our financial results 

on august 10 2006 nvidia announced that the audit committee of the board with the assistance of outside legal counsel was conducting a review of our stock option practices covering the time from nvidia’s initial public offering in 1999 our fiscal year 2000 through june 2006 the audit committee reached the conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods as a result nvidia recorded additional noncash stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects related to stock option grants 

the audit committee’s review of nvidia’s stock option practices identified a number of occasions on which the measurement date used for financial accounting and reporting purposes for stock options granted to certain of our employees was different from the actual grant date to correct these accounting errors we amended our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 29 2006 and our quarterly report on form 10q for the three months ended april 30 2006 to restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those reports 

this review of our historical stock option granting practices required us to incur substantial expenses for legal accounting tax and other professional services diverted our management’s attention from our business and in the future could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings ten derivative complaints have been filed in state and federal court pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants we cannot assure you that these or future similar complaints or any future litigation or regulatory action will result in the same conclusions reached by the audit committee the conduct and resolution of these matters will be time consuming expensive and could distract our management’s attention from the conduct of our business which could negatively impact our business 

we voluntarily contacted the sec regarding the audit committee’s review and as of the date of the filing of this form 10k the sec is continuing the inquiry of our historical stock option grant practices it began in late august 2006 in october 2006 we met with the sec and provided it with a review of the status of the audit committee’s review and in november 2006 we voluntarily provided the sec with further documents we plan to continue to cooperate with the sec in its inquiry 

while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in concluding the correct measurement dates for option grants the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported or not reported the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors and there is a risk that its inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements amend prior filings made with the sec or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our sec reports furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast any change in such factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

we continue to pursue improved gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors such as 

 

        

if we incorrectly forecast the impact of any of the aforementioned factors on our business we may be unable to take action in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively impact our business 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees none of our executive officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with our executive officers and employees are at will we do not have “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our executive officers technical personnel or other key employees particularly jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer would harm our business our success will depend on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business the integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing andor new products could reduce our gross margin and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

 

semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 

because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation our revenue and our gross profit our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could reduce our gross margin we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation result in our customers working with our competitors and could adversely impact our financial results 

to stay competitive we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase we have increased our engineering and technical resources and had 2668 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 28 2007 1654 fulltime employees as of january 29 2006 and 1231 fulltime employees as of january 30 2005 research and development expenditures were 5535 million 3571 million and 3482 million for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 included 701 million related to noncash stockbased compensation net of associated payroll taxes which we began to record in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123r if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as hiring additional employees research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may not be able to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 276 241 and 275 of our total revenue during fiscal years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively operating expenses for fiscal 2007 included 1085 million related to noncash stockbased compensation net of associated payroll taxes which we began to record in fiscal 2007 as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123r since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results would be negatively impacted 

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect our operating results and gross margin 

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we currently use 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron 90 nanometer and 65 nanometer process technologies for our families of gpus mcps handheld gpus and application processors 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully additionally we compete with companies that own their own manufacturing facilities these competitors may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly than our manufacturing partners if our suppliers fall behind our competitors in the manufacturing processes the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory or conversely may result in inadequate inventory levels either of which could adversely affect our financial results 

our inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts or orders from our customers which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing in forecasting demand we must make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of the value of our inventory andor a reduction in average selling prices and where our gross margin could be adversely affected include 

    

conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for either our older or newer products we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation 

because we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls is limited 

 

substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than longterm agreements as a result we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth which does not occur any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results   

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our stock could decline 

 

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

any one or more of the factors discussed in this form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance in addition the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year 

 

risks related to our products 

 

  if we are unable to achieve design wins our products may not be adopted by our target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

the future success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers will aid our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations this requires that we do the following 

     

if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their design systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to allow us to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that our products will achieve design wins 

 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers including amd intel and microsoft such changes would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to be compliant with relevant standards if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time our ability to achieve design wins could suffer if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

achievement of design wins may not result in the success of our products and could result in a loss of market share 

 

the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem or odm product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of endusers for a particular product feature which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business even if we do have design wins for oem and odm products we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet the oem odm addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ design cycles as well as other market demand additionally even if we achieve a significant number of design wins there can be no assurance that our oem and odm customers will actually take the design to production or that the design will be commercially successful furthermore there may be changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products that could negatively impact the success of our products any of these factors could result in a loss of market share and could negatively impact our financial results   

our business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts are unsuccessful 

 

we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products any delay in the future or failure of our gpus or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors including the following 

 

        

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the cad industry we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers if these relationships are not successful we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new processors would harm our business 

 

our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 

 

as our gpus or other processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices and gross margins in order for our processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our processor for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion in addition we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ odms’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 

as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition technologies developed by others may render our processors noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory any of which would harm our business 

we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 

products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in some of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any defects or incompatibilities in the future errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field we may also be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect which could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development of new products these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results we may also suffer a loss of reputation loss of revenues andor a loss in our market share any of which could materially harm our financial results   

risks related to our partners and customers 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

 

in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our existing products and services or help expand our distribution channels we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market for example in february 2006 we completed the acquisition of uli in march 2006 we completed the acquisition of hybrid graphics and in january 2007 we completed the acquisition of portalplayer if we do consider other acquisitions a strategic alliance or a joint venture the negotiations could divert management’s attention as well as other resources for any previous or future acquisition or investment including the acquisitions of uli hybrid graphics and portalplayer the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products which could negatively impact our growth or our financial results 

             

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we pay all or a portion of the purchase price in cash our cash reserves would be reduced we paid for the acquisitions of hybrid graphics uli and portalplayer with primarily cash if the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

 

we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility our products require wafers manufactured with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques so we utilize industryleading suppliers to produce our semiconductor wafers we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices currently one foundry manufactures the majority of our products these manufacturers may be unable to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing or pricing requirements we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis the foundries we use have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product these suppliers including the fabrication facility that produces a majority of our products fabricate wafers for other companies including some of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with thirdparty manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing so that we are able to respond to customer demand 

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our products 

 

our processors are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as ase amkor kyec spil and chippac we do not have longterm agreements with any of these subcontractors as a result of our dependence on thirdparty subcontractors for assembly testing and packaging of our products we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality demand for qualified independent subcontractors to assemble and test products is high if demand for these subcontractors exceeds the number of qualified subcontractors we may experience capacity constraints which could result in product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any of our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of one of our competitors over our orders any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble test or package our products or components any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers 

 

there can be no assurance that the playstation3 will achieve long term commercial success 

 

in april 2005 we finalized our definitive agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce’s playstation3 our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation3 and all derivatives including nextgeneration digital consumer electronics devices in addition we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce during fiscal 2007 we recognized 929 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce there can be no assurance that the playstation3 will achieve long term commercial success given the intense competition in the game console market if we do not receive royalties as we anticipate our revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected 

as we continue to work directly with more foreign customers any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition 

 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry in addition difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums which could adversely affect our operating results we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions in the future which could negatively impact our financial results 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products 

 

when we design and develop new products or product enhancements we rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or enhancements to existing products although we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future additionally the software development tools available at the time that we are designing simulating or verifying a product may not be sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough for our purposes for example we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products therefore the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that are available to us if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands we may miss design cycles or lose design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of any of these customers 

 

we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated sales to one significant customer accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue during fiscal 2007 sales to two significant customers during fiscal 2006 accounted for approximately 26 of our total revenue in addition one customer has historically comprised a significant portion of our handheld gpu business revenue although a small number of our other customers represents the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world who in many cases specify the graphics supplier our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers or if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

risks related to our competition 

 

as intel and amd continue to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete and our business would be negatively impacted 

we expect substantial competition from both intel’s and amd’s strategy of selling platform solutions such as the success intel achieved with its centrino platform solution in addition to the centrino notebook platform solution intel has announced a desktop initiative branded as viiv shortly after its acquisition of ati amd also announced a platform solution such platform solutions do not require a discrete gpu from a thirdparty supplier such as nvidia prior to its acquisition of ati amd did not sell their own gpus but instead relied on companies such as ati or nvidia to supply graphics technology if amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions in desktop and notebook pcs we may be unable to sell gpus to either company additionally we expect that intel and amd will extend this strategy to other segments including professional workstations and servers to the extent intel and amd are successful with the platform strategy they would no longer need our discrete gpu solutions which would negatively impact our business 

the market for gpu mcp handheld gpus and application processors is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 

 

the market for gpus mcps and handheld gpus is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products which could harm our business 

for example we are the largest supplier of amd 64 chipsets with 53 segment share nvidia nforce mcp unit shipments for amd64based cpus increased over 113 calendar yearovercalendar year based on the mercury research fourth quarter 2006 pc processor forecast report decline in demand in the amd segment would harm our business 

 

an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and handheld gpu solutions some of our competitors may have or be able to obtain greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors include the following 

  

 

  

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current or new markets our financial results will suffer 

risks related to market conditions 

 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

 

our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states additionally we generated 836 of our revenue for fiscal 2007 and 840 of our revenue for fiscal 2006 from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states and other americas including but not limited to 

               

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we have offices outside of the united states including offices in taiwan japan korea china hong kong india france russia germany finland and england during fiscal 2007 we added 934 international employees to our international operations as a result of our acquisition of portalplayer we acquired land and a building under construction in hyderabad india our operations in our international locations are subject to many of the risks contained in the above list we intend to continue to expand our operations and expect to open other international offices difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

 

we derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets in the next several years a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales will reduce demand for our products moreover changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our business 

if our products do not continue to be adopted by the consumer and enterprise desktop pc notebook pc workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets or if the demand in these markets for new and innovative products decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

 

our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3d graphics and multimedia in consumer and enterprise pc notebook pc workstation pda cellular phone and video game console applications the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our gpu and mcp businesses comprised over 865 of fiscal 2007 revenue as such our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus or mcps do not continue to achieve widespread adoption by the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers oems odms addincard and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the market does not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline 

 

our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

  

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products the european union directive on restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive is european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances including lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the european union which became effective on july 1 2006 similarly the state of california has adopted certain restrictions which go into effect in 2007 that restrict the use of certain materials in electronic products which are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive and other states are contemplating similar legislation china has adopted similar legislation to the rohs directive which began to go into effect on march 1 2007 

also we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august 15 2005 implementation in certain european union member states has been delayed into 2007 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including the united states canada mexico china and japan the cumulative impact of which could be significant we continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by weee 

it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages delays or excess noncompliant inventory may occur as a result of such regulations failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including costs fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability to conduct business in the countries that have adopted these types of regulations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

 

at the end of fiscal 2007 we had 112 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in us dollars 

 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 

our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results 

 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints variations in manufacturing costs and yields significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry which can be unpredictable and rapid in an efficient and timely manner our operating results could suffer in particular from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand during a downturn our revenue and earnings will suffer 

 

political instability in taiwan and in the people’s republic of china or elsewhere could harm our business 

 

because of our reliance on foundries and independent contractors located in taiwan and the people’s republic of china and because we have offices in these locations our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan including the worsening of the strained relations between the people’s republic of china and taiwan 

risks related to government action regulatory action intellectual property and litigation 

the pending investigation by the united states department of justice regarding investigation into the market for graphics processors could adversely affect our business 

on november 29 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards no specific allegations have been made against us we plan to cooperate with the doj in its investigation as of march 14 2007 42 civil complaints have been filed against us the majority are pending in the northern district of california a number are pending in the central district of california and other cases are pending in several other federal district courts although the complaints differ they generally purport to assert federal and state antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and advanced micro devices inc or amd as a result of its acquisition of ati technologies inc or ati many of the cases also assert a variety of state law unfair competition or consumer protection claims on the same allegations and some cases assert unjust enrichment or other common law claims the complaints are putative class actions alleging classes of direct andor indirect purchasers of our graphic processing units and cards the plaintiffs in a few of the northern district of california actions have filed a motion with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation asking that all pending and subsequent cases be consolidated in one court for all pretrial discovery and motion practice a hearing on this motion is set for march 29 2007 we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases 

expensing employee stock options materially and aversely affects our reported operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us as a result of adjustments arising from our restatement related to stock option grant dates our operating results for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007 contain recorded amounts of stockbased compensation expense for our fiscal 2000 through 2006 this stockbased compensation expense was calculated using primarily the intrinsic valuebased method under accounting principles board opinion no 25 or apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments sfas no 123r requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards during fiscal 2007 we recorded 1167 million related to stockbased compensation net of the associated payroll tax impact resulting from our restatement which negatively impacted our operating results we believe that sfas no 123r will continue to negatively impact our operating results 

to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

we are a party to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business and financial condition 

we are a party to litigation there can be no assurance that actions that have been brought against us or any brought by us will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages and other related fees regardless of whether these lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to technology used by us in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as 

 

     

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

 

we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to these customers an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

in addition we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

     

if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

if infringement claims are made against us or we are found to infringe a third parties’ patent we may seek licenses under the third parties’ patents or other intellectual property rights in addition an indemnified customer may be required to obtain a license to a third parties’ patents or intellectual property however licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly by competitors if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products used by an indemnified customer we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our business furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

      

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls   

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and testing companies’ internal controls remains subject to some uncertainty to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate such material weakness identified in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations  

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

risks related to our common stock 

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

    

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

3dfx 

on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx interactive inc or 3dfx which closed on april 18 2001 

 

in may 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s san jose california commercial real estate lease carramerica in december 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s austin texas commercial real estate lease carlyle fortran trust the landlords’ complaints both asserted claims for among other things interference with contract successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seek to recover among other things amounts owed on their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately 15 million in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california the landlords’ actions were subsequently removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california and consolidated for purposes of discovery with a complaint filed by the trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case upon motion by nvidia in 2005 the district court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court and the landlord actions were removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on november 10 2005 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints and allowed the landlords to have until february 4 2006 to amend their complaints the landlords refiled claims against nvidia in early february 2006 and nvidia again filed motions requesting the district court to dismiss all such claims the district court took both motions under submission on september 29 2006 the court dismissed the carramerica action in its entirety and without leave to amend the court found among other things that carramerica lacks standing to bring the lawsuit and that such standing belongs exclusively to the bankruptcy trustee on october 27 2006 carramerica filed a notice of appeal from that order on december 15 2006 the district court also dismissed the carlyle complaint in its entirety finding that carlyle lacked standing to pursue some of its claims and that certain other claims were substantively unmeritorious nvidia has filed motions to recover its litigation costs and attorneys fees against both carlyle and carr those motions are currently scheduled for hearing in early april 2007 

in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate the trustee’s complaint asserts claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us on october 13 2005 the court held a hearing on the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication on december 23 2005 the court issued its ruling denying the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication in all material respects and holding that nvidia is prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx transaction to nvidia was less than 1080 million the court expressly denied the trustee’s request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia were at least 1080 million in early november 2005 after many months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee reached a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against nvidia this conditional settlement presented as the centerpiece of a proposed plan of liquidation in the bankruptcy case was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement which would have called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx 

 

however the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process on december 21 2005 the bankruptcy court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan   in addition while the conditional settlement agreement was awaiting the confirmation process the bankruptcy court over objection of the creditors’ committee and nvidia ordered the discovery portion of the trustee’s litigation to proceed the expert discovery was completed but the bankruptcy court also ruled on a trustee discovery motion allowing additional discovery of nvidia because that order would have required nvidia to disclose privileged attorneyclient communications nvidia asked the district court to review that order and to stay its execution while the district court’s review is pending the district court did issue the requested stay order on august 3 2006 oral argument on that matter was held on november 15 2006 and the district court reversed the bankruptcy court’s order by order of its own dated december 15 2006 the district court permitted certain limited additional discovery but concluded that on the record before it there was no basis to set aside the attorneyclient privilege 

 

following the trustee’s filing of a form 8k on behalf of 3dfx in which the trustee disclosed the terms of the proposed settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor’s committee certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interests of 3dfx shareholders that petition was granted and an equity holders committee was appointed since that appointment the equity holders committee has filed a competing plan of reorganizationliquidation the equity holders plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be used to retire all of 3dfx’s debts upon the payment of that debt the equity holders committee contends that nvidia would be obliged to pay the stock consideration provided for in the asset purchase agreement by virtue of stock splits since the execution of the asset purchase agreement the stock consideration would now total four million shares of our common stock the equity holders’ committee filed a motion with the bankruptcy court for an order giving it standing to bring that lawsuit to enforce the asset purchase agreement over our objection the bankruptcy court granted that motion on may 1 2006 and the equity holders’ committee filed its complaint for declaratory relief against nvidia that same day nvidia moved to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief and the bankruptcy court granted that motion with leave to amend the equity committee thereafter amended its complaint and nvidia moved to dismiss that amended complaint as well at the hearing on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court granted the motion as to one of the equity holders’ committee’s claims and denied it as to the others however the bankruptcy court also ruled that nvidia would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which the equity holders’ committee seeks a determination that the asset purchase agreement was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection that the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the asset purchase agreement and that the agreement is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy estate in addition the equity holders committee filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for harbinger capital partners master fund i ltd an equity investment firm that has conditionally agreed to pay no more than 515 million for preferred stock in 3dfx the hearing on that motion was held on january 18 2007 and the court approved the proposed protections beginning on march 21 2007 nvidia and the trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to nvidia and in particular whether the price nvidia paid for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to nvidia 

 

lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices and sec inquiry 

 

in june 2006 the audit committee of the board of nvidia or the audit committee began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management the audit committee with the assistance of outside legal counsel completed its review on november 13 2006 when the audit committee reported its findings to our full board the review covered option grants to all employees directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in january 1999 through june 2006 based on the findings of the audit committee and our internal review we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes 

we voluntarily contacted the sec regarding the audit committee’s review and as of the date of the filing of this form 10k the sec is continuing the inquiry of our historical stock option grant practices it began in late august 2006 in october 2006 we met with the sec and provided it with a review of the status of the audit committee’s review and in november 2006 we voluntarily provided the sec with further documents we continue to cooperate with the sec in its inquiry 

concurrently with our internal review and the sec’s inquiry since september 29 2006 ten derivative cases have been filed in state and federal courts asserting claims concerning errors related to our historical stock option granting practices and associated accounting for stockbased compensation expense these complaints have been filed in various courts including the california superior court santa clara county the united states district court for the northern district of california and the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california on february 28 2007 the california superior court cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs are scheduled to file a consolidated complaint on or before march 22 2007 all of the cases purport to be brought derivatively on behalf of nvidia against members of our board and several of our current and former officers and directors all allege in substantially similar fashion claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment insider selling abuse of control gross mismanagement waste constructive fraud and violations of sections 10b and 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act the plaintiffs seek to recover for nvidia among other things damages in an unspecified amount rescission punitive damages treble damages for insider selling and fees and costs plaintiffs also seek an accounting a constructive trust and other equitable relief   we intend to take all appropriate action in response to these complaints 

opti incorporated 

on october 19 2004 opti incorporated or opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas in its complaint opti asserted that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five united states patents held by opti opti sought unspecified damages for our alleged conduct attorneys’ fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by nvidia in april 2006 the district court issued a markman ruling adopting optis proposed construction on 13 of the 15 terms at issue and opti dropped from the lawsuit two of the five united states patents that opti alleged nvidia infringes and elected to pursue the three remaining patents at trial 

in august 2006 opti and nvidia settled this litigation under that settlement nvidia was obligated to pay to opti 110 million dollars for past and present licenses to the patents in suit and nvidia agreed to make additional quarterly payments to opti should nvidia use certain patented technology after january 31 2007 the case has now been dismissed with prejudice the agreements with opti call for us to pay 110 million in exchange for opti’s dismissal of its lawsuit against us and for certain patent license rights of this 110 million we recorded 80 million as a patentrelated intangible asset and 30 million as a charge to cost of revenue 

 

department of justice subpoena and investigation 

on november 29 2006 we received a subpoena from the san francisco office of the antitrust division of the united states department of justice or doj in connection with the dojs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards no specific allegations have been made against us we plan to cooperate with the doj in its investigation as of march 14 2007 42 civil complaints have been filed against us the majority are pending in the northern district of california a number are pending in the central district of california and other cases are pending in several other federal district courts although the complaints differ they generally purport to assert federal and state antitrust claims based on alleged price fixing market allocation and other alleged anticompetitive agreements between us and advanced micro devices inc or amd as a result of its acquisition of ati technologies inc or ati many of the cases also assert a variety of state law unfair competition or consumer protection claims on the same allegations and some cases assert unjust enrichment or other common law claims the complaints are putative class actions alleging classes of direct andor indirect purchasers of our graphic processing units and cards the plaintiffs in a few of the northern district of california actions have filed a motion with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation asking that all pending and subsequent cases be consolidated in one court for all pretrial discovery and motion practice a hearing on this motion is set for march 29 2007 we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases

restatement 

on november 29 2006 we restated our previouslyissued financial statements for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 together with selected financial statement items for earlier years to correct errors related to accounting for stockbased compensation expense in june 2006 the audit committee of the board of nvidia or the audit committee began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management the audit committee with the assistance of outside legal counsel completed its review on november 13 2006 when the audit committee reported its findings to our board of directors or the board the review covered option grants to all employees directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in january 1999 through june 2006 based on the findings of the audit committee and our internal review we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes these errors resulted primarily from our use during our fiscal years 2000 2001 and 2002 of certain date selection methods discussed below which resulted in employees receiving options with stated exercise prices lower than the market prices as measured based upon the actual grant dates we ceased using such practices beginning in our fiscal year 2003 the audit committee found that beginning in our fiscal year 2003 we improved our stock option grant processes and have generally granted and priced our employee stock options in an objective and consistent manner since that time however for one companywide annual stock option grant we made in fiscal 2004 we did not finalize the number of options allocated to each employee as of the stated grant date in may 2003 which resulted in stockbased compensation charges due to the change in the measurement date to the date the grants were finalized the audit committee’s review did not identify any additional stockbased compensation charges from measurement date issues subsequent to that fiscal 2004 grant 

as a result of the measurement date errors identified from the audit committee’s review through january 29 2006 we recorded aggregate noncash stockbased compensation charges of 1274 million net of related tax effects the errors resulted in aftertax charges of 14 million and 117 million for our fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally the cumulative effect of the related aftertax charges for periods prior to our fiscal year ended january 30 2005 was 1142 million these additional stockbased compensation expense charges were noncash and had no impact on our reported revenue cash cash equivalents or marketable securities for each of the restated periods these charges were based primarily on accounting principles board opinion no 25 or apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees intrinsic valuebased charges and associated payroll taxes of 1996 million on a pretax basis which were amortized over the vesting term of the stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 28 or fin 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  we amortized a substantial portion of these charges to expense during our fiscal years 2000 to 2006 

 

the types of errors we identified generally fell into the following categories 

 

improper measurement dates for companywide annual or retention stock option grants  we determined that in connection with certain annual or retention stock option grants that we made to employees during our fiscal years 2000 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 the final number of shares that an individual employee was entitled to receive was not determined andor the proper approval of the related stock option grant had not been given until after the stated grant date therefore the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date resulting in new measurement dates for the related options 

 

improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal years 2001 and 2002  in connection with stock option grants that we made to newlyhired employees and to a much lesser degree retention grants to existing employees during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 our practice was to grant stock options with an exercise price based upon the lowest closing price of our common stock in the last few days of the month of hire or the last few days of any subsequent month in the quarter of hire the selection of the grant date of the related option grants would be made at the end of the fiscal quarter and was based on achieving the lowest exercise price for the affected employees as a result of these practices the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date resulting in new measurement dates for the related options 

 

improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal year 2000 in connection with certain stock option grants to newlyhired employees and to a much lesser degree retention grants to existing employees during a portion of fiscal year 2000 our practice was to delay the selection of the related grant dates until the end of a twomonth period in the fiscal quarter during which the employees who received the grants began their employment with nvidia as a result of this practice the exercise price of the related option grants was not determined until subsequent to the stated grant date we also determined that during fiscal year 2000 we generally set the grant date and exercise price of employee option grants for new hires and promotions at the lowest price of the last few business days of the month of their hire or promotion or of the following month in certain twomonth periods that were chosen for an indeterminate reason as a result of these practices the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date resulting in new measurement dates for the related options in addition we also determined that the exercise price or the number of options to be granted had not been determined or the proper approval had not been given for various other miscellaneous option grants during fiscal year 2000 until after the stated grant date  resulting in new measurement dates for accounting purposes for the related options 

other issues identified we also identified instances where stock option grants did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from which the grants were issued for example two grants were made to officers of nvidia by the chief executive officer under delegated authority however under the terms of the applicable plan the option grant should have been made by our board or the compensation committee there were also instances where 1 option grants were made to a small group of employees who joined nvidia pursuant to a business combination and to a few other employees in certain instances with stated exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on the actual measurement date of the related grants and 2 option grants were made to a few individuals who were contractors rather than employees without recording the appropriate accounting charges in addition the audit committee did not find any evidence that these violations were committed for improper purposes 

  

the following table reconciles sharebased compensation previously recorded the impact of these errors by type to the total restated sharebased compensation for all periods impacted 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable inventories income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k     

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 

 

our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 

 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf 019 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products if market conditions decline we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

 

license and development revenue 

 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated to date we have not recorded any such losses costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

 

accounts receivable 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2007 

as of january 28 2007 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 13 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 5344 million of the 5344 million 1503 million was covered by credit insurance and 198 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 04 during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit as of january 28 2007 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range at 04 of our gross receivable balance then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january 28 2007 would have been approximately 24 million rather than the actual balance of 13 million 

 

inventories 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin as of january 28 2007 our inventory reserve was 397 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 89 and 159 during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 as of january 28 2007 our inventory reserve represented 101 of our gross inventory balance if our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range at 159 of our gross inventory balance then our inventory reserve balance at january 28 2007 would have been approximately 628 million rather than the actual balance of 397 million inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

income taxes 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

 

united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

 

as of january 28 2007 we had a valuation allowance of 686 million of the total valuation allowance 37 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes and 649 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero then reduce other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 

as of january 28 2007 with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r share based payment  we have derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation reflected in our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards and the offsetting valuation allowance consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 3449 million as of january 28 2007 will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to do so on a “withandwithout” approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 

 

goodwill 

 

our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with such tests 

stockbased compensation 

effective january 30 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r which establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period stockbased compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2007 was 1167 million which consisted of stockbased compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan please refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning january 30 2006 as provided by sfas no 123r we recognize stockbased compensation expense using the straightline attribution method we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a latticebinomial model prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we recorded stockbased compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 or sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosures  

at the beginning of fiscal 2006 we transitioned from a blackscholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stockbased compensation awards granted under our stock option plans the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules death and disability probabilities expected volatility and riskfree interest our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts w e began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 

using the latticebinomial model  the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended january 28 2007  

 

 

  for our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the blackscholes model the fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended january 28 2007 

 

 

sfas no 123r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

 

litigation investigation and settlement costs 

 

from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs

we report financial information for four productline operating segments to our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker as follows the gpu business the mcp business the handheld gpu business and the consumer electronics business  revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of memory devices please refer to note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

fiscal 2005 was a 53week year compared to fiscal years 2007 and 2006 which were 52week years and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005 however we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our fiscal 2005 revenue 

 

fiscal year 2007 vs fiscal year 2006   

 

revenue was 307 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to 238 billion for fiscal 2006 which represents an increase of 292 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 203 to 199 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to 166 billion for fiscal 2006 the increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop gpu products notebook products and our nvidia professional workstation products the increase in sales of our desktop gpu products was led by our geforce 7based and geforce 8based products that serve the highend segment sales of our nvidia notebook products improved due to an increased mix of geforce 7based products shipping for notebook pc design wins based on intel’s napa platform this increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices our nvidia professional workstation product sales increased due to an increase in unit shipments offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices 

mcp business  mcp business revenue was 6615 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 3523 million for fiscal 2006 which represents an increase of 878 the overall increase in mcp business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer nvidia nforce4 products nvidia nforce5 products integrated amdbased desktop products and integrated intelbased desktop products which began shipping after the second quarter of fiscal 2007 in addition revenue also increased as a result of our acquisition of uli in february 2006 

 

handheld gpu business  handheld gpu business revenue was 1085 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 587 million for fiscal 2006 which represents an increase of 847 the overall increase in handheld gpu business revenue is due to an increase in unit sales of highend feature cellular phone and pda products 

consumer electronics business consumer electronics business revenue was 963 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 1674 million for fiscal 2006 which represents a decrease of 425 this decrease is a result of discontinued sales of our xboxrelated products to microsoft partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual development arrangements we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2007 we recognized 929 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce for its playstation3 compared to 490 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2006 

 

for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we expect a seasonal decline associated with the pc business although we believe our market and competitive position in each of our business units continues to be strong there are no significant industry growth drivers to offset seasonality microsoft’s next generation operating system microsoft windows vista or vista has shipped we believe that vista is the first operating system to present as a standard the power of the gpu to all applications and that in the future a significant percentage of pcs will have vista with vista dx10 and hdbluray dvd as the technologies for pcs for the coming year we believe that 3d graphics will become a central part of the computing experience and that the gpu will be more important than ever however to date we have not seen a significant impact from the launch of vista 

fiscal year 2006 vs fiscal year 2005   

 

revenue was 238 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to 201 billion for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 182 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 229 to 166 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to 135 billion for fiscal 2005 the increase was the result of increased sales of our geforce 6 and geforce 7 families of desktop gpus that serve the highend gpu segment offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream gpu products in addition sales of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of geforce 6based and geforce 7based products which resulted in an increase in average selling prices 

mcp business  mcp business revenue was 3523 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 1757 million for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 1006 the overall increase in mcp business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of nvidia nforce4 products which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and an increase in average selling prices the overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce2 products 

 

handheld gpu business  handheld gpu business revenue was 587 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 459 million for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 279 the overall increase in handheld gpu business revenue is due to an increase in average selling prices of highend feature phone products and revenue recognized as a result of a development contract 

 

consumer electronics business  consumer electronics business revenue was 1674 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 2600 million for fiscal 2005 which represents a decrease of 356 the decrease in our consumer electronics business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our xboxrelated products to microsoft partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with sce during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xboxrelated products from us after our second fiscal quarter as a result we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2006 we recognized 490 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce’s playstation3 no such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with sce was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

concentration of revenue   

 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 836 840 and 759 of total revenue for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers or cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to discontinued sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product during fiscal 2006 which were billed to microsoft in the united states 

 

  sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007 26 of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006 and 31 of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2005 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold our gross margin was 424 383 and 322 for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

fiscal year 2007 vs fiscal year 2006   

 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the sale of our geforce 8 series gpus and increased sales of our geforce 7 series gpus which collectively accounted for approximately 70 of our gpu business revenue our geforce 8 and our geforce 7 series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus 

 

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated amdbased desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete mcp products and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 

  handheld gpu business  the gross margin of our handheld gpu business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in unit sales of highend feature cellular phone and pda products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous handheld gpu products 

 

  consumer electronics business  the gross margin of our consumer electronics business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to license and royalty revenue from our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared to the gross margin of xbox products shipped in fiscal 2006 

 

fiscal year 2006 vs fiscal year 2005   

 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the sale of our geforce 7 series gpus and increased sales of our geforce 6 series gpus which collectively accounted for approximately 78 of our fiscal 2006 gpu business revenue our geforce 7 and our geforce 6 series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our geforce fx series gpus which comprised 53 of our fiscal 2005 gpu business revenue in addition average selling prices from our notebook geforce 7 and geforce 6 series gpu products increased as a larger percentage of our total notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

 

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce4 products which to date have experienced higher gross margins than previous generations of nvidia nforce products 

handheld gpu business  the gross margin of our handheld gpu business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inventory writeoff of certain handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 

 

consumer electronics business  the gross margin of our consumer electronics business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the reduction of die costs for xboxrelated products and the recognition of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce’s playstation3 

 

consolidated gross margin   

 

the improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth we expect gross margin to remain flat or improve slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

operating expenses 

 

research and development 

 

1     stockbased compensation includes chargescredits relating to payroll taxes accrued for as part of the restatement         

  research and development expenses increased by 1964 million or 55 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 752 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 1014 additional personnel and a 642 million increase in stockbased compensation due to our adoption of sfas no 123r during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 inprocess research and development expense or iprd increased by 140 million as a result of our acquisitions of portalplayer and hybrid graphics during fiscal 2007 depreciation and amortization increased 16 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2006 resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2007 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2006 computer software and equipment increased 112 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased 64 million due to increased facilities expense allocation both of which were based on the growth in headcount new product development increased by 71 million as a result of costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tapeouts and in prototype materials license and development project costs decreased by 105 million primarily due to the inversed impact of decreased development costs related to our collaboration with sce and other engineering costs related to a different development contract certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects the cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet during fiscal 2007 less time was spent working on development projects so less cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and therefore more cost remained in research and development other expenses increased 62 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of uli and hybrid graphics 

research and development expenses increased by 89 million or 3 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 325 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 423 additional personnel and a 53 million increase in computer software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses depreciation and amortization increased 21 million due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased 06 million due to increased facilities expense allocation both of which were based on the growth in headcount other expenses increased 39 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites these increases were offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense of 82 million and an increase of 269 million in license and development project costs primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with sce and other engineering costs related to a different development contract certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects the cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet during fiscal 2006 more time was spent working on development projects so more cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and therefore less cost remained in research and development 

 

we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

 

sales general and administrative 

 

 

1     stockbased compensation includes chargescredits relating to payroll taxes accrued for as part of the restatement   

sales general and administrative expenses increased 914 million or 45 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 407 million increase in stockbased compensation resulting from our adoption of sfas no 123r during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and a 307 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 201 additional personnel legal and accounting fees increased by 72 million primarily due to our internal review of historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior year financial results advertising and promotions increased by 141 million due to travel and other employee costs associated with our international expansion these increases were offset by a decrease of 29 million in other expenses related to reimbursement from collection settlements 

 

sales general and administrative expenses decreased 21 million or 1 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a a 172 million decrease in advertising and promotion costs primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing programs tradeshow expenses new product launches and customer samples other marketing costs travel related and employee recruitment expenses in addition stockbased compensation expense decreased by 59 million and depreciation and amortization decreased by 45 million these decreases were offset by a 139 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a 61 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx interactive inc or 3dfx and american video graphics lp or avg in addition there were increases of 29 million in facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites and 26 million in other general and administrative expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 

 

operating expenses 

 

we anticipate that our operating expenses will be relatively flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we believe that even with the additional expense from our acquisition of portalplayer we may be able to keep operating expenses flat as we focus on expense controls and restrict headcount additions in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

inprocess research and development 

 

in connection with our acquisition of hybrid graphics in march 2006 and portalplayer in january 2007 we wroteoff 06 million and 134 million respectively of iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin 4 applicability of sfas no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of sfas no 2  amounts assigned to iprd meeting the abovestated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 

 

settlement costs 

 

settlement costs were 142 million for fiscal 2006 the settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters 3dfx and avg avg is settled for further information about the 3dfx matter please refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

interest income and interest expense 

 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income increased from 207 million to 418 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006 interest income increased from 114 million to 207 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 

other income expense net 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities there were no significant changes in other income from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 however other income decreased by 11 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

income taxes 

 

    we recognized income tax expense of 464 million 556 million and 184 million during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 94 in fiscal 2007 156 in fiscal 2006 and 172 in fiscal 2005 

 

the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax with the additional change in mix in fiscal 2007 due to certain stockbased compensation expensed for financial accounting purposes under sfas no 123r and an increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal 2007

    operating activities generated cash of 5871 million 4464 million and 1322 million during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income is due primarily to noncash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options noncash charges to earnings included stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization on our longterm assets upon adoption of sfas no 123r in fiscal 2007 noncash charges to earnings included 1167 million of stockbased compensation expense and related deferred income tax impact the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the 2126 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet accrued liabilities increased 772 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the recording of income taxes payable for fiscal 2006 the increase in accruals related to customer programs and the recording of 306 million in relation to 3dfx of which 250 million was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill accounts payable decreased 588 million and inventories decreased 609 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of significant reductions in older products offset by an increase in new products accounts receivable increased 219 million primarily due to increased sales and improved linearity of sales and cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005

stock repurchase program 

 

on august 9 2004 we announced that our board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock subject to certain specifications up to an aggregate maximum amount of 300 million subsequently on march 6 2006 we announced that our board had approved a 400 million increase to the original stock repurchase program as a result of this increase the amount of common stock the board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of 700 million the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase programs in compliance with the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 

as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 103 million shares of our common stock for 2750 million under structured share repurchase transactions which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction through the end of fiscal 2007 we have repurchased 273 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 4881 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for 1250 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter 

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

   ·   decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers’ products 

   ·   inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products 

   ·   competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and 

   ·   new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our operations  our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline” 

 

3dfx asset purchase 

on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement which closed on april 18 2001 to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 

in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought among other things payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx in early november 2005 after many months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee reached a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against nvidia this conditional settlement presented as the centerpiece of a proposed plan of liquidation in the bankruptcy case was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement which would have called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx 

however the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process on december 21 2005 the bankruptcy court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the trustee’s case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors’ committee’s plan beginning on march 21 2007 nvidia and the trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to nvidia and in particular whether the price nvidia paid for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to nvidia 

please refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this litigation

during the fiscal year 2007 we entered into a confidential patent licensing arrangement our commitment for future license payments under this arrangement could range from 970 million to 1100 million over a ten year period however the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced by the occurrence of certain events covered by the arrangement

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued interpretation no 48 or fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement 109 accounting for income taxes  under fin 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position fin 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits fin 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the financial statements any differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of operations as a result of adoption of fin 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the provisions of fin 48 will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal 2008 we believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of fin 48 will not result in any material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 or sfas no 157 fair value measurements  sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 157 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending april 29 2007 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 or sab no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement we adopted the provisions of sab no 108 in our fiscal year 2007 the adoption of sab no 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 or sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending april 27 2008 although earlier adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 159 will have on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

as of january 28 2007 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both  05 would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 30 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and handheld gpus for pcs handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system integrators motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

in the gpu mcp and handheld gpu segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system integrators and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the handheld gpu segments we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant portion of our digital media processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world 

as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to edom technology co ltd or edom accounted for 14 and sales to asustek computer inc or asustek accounted for 12 of our total revenue for fiscal 2006 edom is an independent distributor and asustek is a cem 

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes products available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

seasonality 

our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market due to the seasonality in this market we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the backtoschool and holiday seasons 

 

 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a “fabless” manufacturing strategy for all productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize industryleading suppliers such as chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered semiconductor manufacturing international corporation or smic taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc and united microelectronics corporation or umc to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering or ase amkor technology king yuan electronics co ltd or kyec siliconware precision industries company ltd or spil and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products 

we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system integrators or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

inventory and working capital 

  our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on this forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics hd video audio low power communications storage and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and handheld gpus using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 

we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal 2005 and have 1654 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 29 2006 compared to 1231 employees as of january 30 2005 during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we incurred research and development expenditures of 3521 million 3351 million and 2700 million respectively 

competition 

the market for gpus mcps and handheld gpus is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces or apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs of addin boards or motherboards we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and handheld gpu solutions some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

 

we expect substantial competition from intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products such as when intel achieved success with its centrino platform solution in addition to its current centrino notebook platform initiative and its announced upcoming desktop initiative branded as viiv we expect that intel is now focused on developing and selling platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and servers if intel continues to pursue these initiatives we may not be able to successfully compete in these segments 

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets our financial results will suffer 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our issued patents have expiration dates from september 4 2007 to september 2 2024 we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent 

 

applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products including our digital media processors we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions the location in which our products are manufactured our strategic technology or product directions in different countries and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

as of january 29 2006 we had 2737 employees 1654 of whom were engaged in research and development and 1083 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good 

financial information by business segment and geographic data 

our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or codm reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we reorganized our operating segments to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies we now report financial information for four productline operating segments to our codm the gpu business is composed of products that support desktop pcs notebook pcs and professional workstations the mcp business is composed of nvidia nforce products that operate as a singlechip or chipset that can offload system functions such as audio processing and network communications and perform these operations independently from the host cpu our handheld gpu business is composed of products that support handheld personal digital assistants cellular phones and other handheld devices and our consumer electronics business is concentrated in products that support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 revenue from sales of our xboxrelated products revenue from our license agreement with microsoft relating to the successor product to their initial xbox gaming console the xbox360 and related devices and digital media processor products in addition to these operating segments we have the “all other” category that includes human resources legal finance general administration and corporate marketing expenses which total 1212 million and 1015 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively that we do not allocate to our other operating segments “all other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that are neither individually reportable nor aggregated with another operating segment revenue in the “all other” category is primarily derived from sales of memory all prior period amounts have been restated to reflect our new reporting structure 

our codm does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis operating segments do not record intersegment revenue and accordingly there is none to be reported the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for nvidia as a whole the information included in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements is hereby incorporated by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks related to our operations 

 

because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast any change in such factors could adversely affect our gross margin 

we continue to pursue measures in an effort to improve our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products sales discounts unexpected pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products if we incorrectly forecast the impact of the aforementioned factors on our business we may be unable to take action in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory or conversely may result in inadequate inventory levels either of which could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future in forecasting demand we must make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of the value of our inventory andor a forced reduction in average selling prices and where our gross margin could be adversely affected include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for either our older or newer products we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis which could affect our revenue results even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner inability to fill our customers orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation 

because we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls is limited 

 

substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than longterm agreements as a result we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter and therefore we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results 

 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively impact our business 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees none of our executive officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with our executive officers and employees are at will we do not have “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our executive officers technical personnel or other key employees particularly jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer would harm our business our success will depend on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business the integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 

 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing andor new products would reduce our gross margin and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

 

semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 

because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation our revenue and our gross profit our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers would reduce our gross margin we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation and result in our customers working with our competitors 

to stay competitive we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1654 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 29 2006 1231 employees as of january 30 2005 and 1057 employees as of january 25 2004 research and development expenditures were 3521 million 3351 million and 2700 million for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively if we are required to invest significantly greater 

 

resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue our operating results would decline in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as hiring additional employees research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may have limited ability to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 240 and 267 of our total revenue during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively operating expenses included litigation settlement costs of 142 million in fiscal 2006 since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results would be negatively impacted 

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect our operating results and gross margin 

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we currently use 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron 011 micron and 90 nanometer process technologies for our families of gpus mcps and handheld gpus 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 

 

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our stock could decline 

 

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline perhaps substantially we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

any one or more of the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance in addition the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year 

 

risks related to our products 

 

  if we are unable to achieve design wins our products may not be adopted by our target markets and customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

the future success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers we believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers will aid our future success our oem odm and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations this requires that we do the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their design systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to allow us to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that our products will achieve design wins 

 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers including amd intel and microsoft such changes would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time our ability to achieve design wins could suffer if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

 

achievement of design wins may not result in the success of our products and could result in a loss of market share 

 

the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business even if we do have design wins for oem and odm products we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the oem odm addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ design cycles as well as other market demand additionally even if we achieve a significant number of design wins there can be no assurance that our oem and odm customers will actually take the design to production or that the design will be commercially successful furthermore there may be changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products that could negatively impact the success of our products any of these factors could result in a loss of market share and could negatively impact our financial results 

 

our business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts are unsuccessful 

 

we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products any delay in the future or failure of our gpus or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers if these relationships are not successful we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new processors would harm our business 

 

our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 

 

as our gpus or other processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices and gross margins in order for our processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our processor for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion in addition we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ odms’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 

 

as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition technologies developed by others may render our processors noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory any of which would harm our business 

we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 

products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in some of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any defects or incompatibilities in the future errors in new products or releases after commencement of 

 

commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field we may also be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect which could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development of new products these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results we may also suffer a loss of reputation andor a loss in our market share either of which could materially harm our financial results 

 

risks related to our partners and customers         

 

there can be no assurance that the playstation3 will achieve long term commercial success 

 

in april 2005 we finalized our definitive agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation3 and all derivatives including nextgeneration digital consumer electronics devices in addition we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce during fiscal 2006 we recognized 490 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 depending on the ultimate success of this nextgeneration platform we expect to generate starting in fiscal 2007 revenue ranging from 50 million to 100 million annually from license fees and royalties over the next five years with the possibility of additional royalties for several years thereafter there can be no assurance that the playstation3 will achieve long term commercial success given the intense competition in the game console market additionally we do not have control over the launch date or pricing of the playstation3 as such we do not have control over when we will receive royalties if we do not receive royalties as we anticipate our revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

 

in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market for example in february 2006 we completed the acquisition of uli electronics inc or uli a leading developer of core logic technology for approximately 53 million paid in cash if we do consider an acquisition strategic alliance or joint venture the negotiations could divert management’s attention as well as other resources for any previous or future acquisition or investment including uli the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products which could negatively impact our growth or our financial results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we pay all or a portion of the purchase price in cash our cash reserves would be reduced if the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of any of these customers 

 

we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated sales to our two largest customers accounted for approximately 26 31 and 36 of our revenue during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xboxrelated products from us after our second fiscal quarter as a result the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft although a small number of our other customers represents the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world who in many cases specify the graphics supplier our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers or if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

 

we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility our products require wafers manufactured with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques we utilize industryleading suppliers such as chartered smic tsmc and umc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices these manufacturers may be unable to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing or pricing requirements we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis the foundries we use have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product suppliers such as chartered smic tsmc and umc fabricate wafers for other companies including some of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with thirdparty manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing so that we are able to respond to customer demand 

 

we are dependent on third parties located outside of the united states for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our products 

 

our processors are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors such as ase amkor technology inc kyec spil and stats chippac incorporated all of which are located outside of the united states we do not have longterm agreements with any of these subcontractors as a result of our dependence on thirdparty subcontractors for assembly testing and packaging of our products we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality demand for qualified independent subcontractors to assemble and test products is high if demand for these subcontractors exceeds the number of qualified subcontractors we may experience capacity constraints which could result in product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any of our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of one of our competitors over our orders any product shortages quality assurance problems or political instability outside of the united states could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers 

 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 

 

in the design and development of new products and product enhancements we rely on thirdparty software development tools while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future for example we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that are available to us if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands our business could suffer 

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income and the deferral of revenue recognition from sales to affected customers which could harm our operating results and financial condition 

 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry in addition difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure in addition we purchase credit insurance on selected customers’ accounts receivable balances in an effort to further mitigate our exposure for such losses if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums which could adversely affect our operating results we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions in the future which could negatively impact our financial results 

risks related to our competition 

 

the market for gpu mcp and handheld gpus is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 

 

the market for gpus mcps and handheld gpus is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products which could harm our business 

 

an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and handheld gpu solutions some of our competitors may have or be able to obtain greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors include the following 

 

 

 

 

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets our financial results will suffer 

 

as intel continues to pursue platform solutions we may not be able to successfully compete 

we expect substantial competition from intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products such as when intel achieved success with its centrino platform solution in addition to its current centrino notebook platform initiative and its announced upcoming desktop initiative branded as viiv we expect that intel is now focused on developing and selling platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and servers if intel continues to pursue these initiatives we may not be able to successfully compete in these segments 

risks related to market conditions 

 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

 

a significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states additionally we generated 84 76 and 75 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states and sales to these 

 

customers outside of the united states and other americas subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states and other americas including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

we have offices outside of the united states including offices in taiwan japan korea china hong kong india france russia germany and england during fiscal 2006 we substantially increased our international employee resources from 242 employees as of january 30 2005 to 615 fulltime employees as of january 29 2006 on february 20 2006 we completed the acquisition of uli a leading developer of core logic technology which added approximately 18 to 22 employees to our international operations our operations in our international locations are subject to many of the risks contained in the above list we intend to continue to expand our international operations and to open other international offices difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

currently all of our arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers and subcontractors provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars as are sales to our customers located outside of the united states and other americas increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which would negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

 

we derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets including professional workstations we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets in the next several years a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales will reduce demand for our products moreover changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our business 

 

if our products do not continue to be accepted by the consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console markets or if the demand in these markets for new and innovative products decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

 

our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for 3d graphics in consumer and enterprise pc notebook workstation pda cellular phone and video game console applications the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions since the gpu business is our core business our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the consumer and enterprise pc notebook and workstation markets we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers and the market do not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline 

 

  our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

    

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products for example the semiconductor industry is moving towards becoming compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive which will become effective in july 2006 the rohs directive is european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances including lead similarly the state of california has adopted certain restrictions which go into effect in 2007 that restrict the use of certain materials in electronic products that are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive and other states are contemplating similar legislation china has promulgated use restrictions on the same substances as the rohs directive but has not yet defined either the scope of the affected products or an effective date of any such restrictions 

also we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august 15 2005 and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced we continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by weee 

it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages delays or excess noncompliant inventory may occur as a result of such regulations failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilities 

hostilities involving the united states andor terrorist attacks could harm our business 

the financial political economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks on the united states in 2001 led to a weakening of the global economy similar terrorist acts andor the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states and iraq or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers distributors and suppliers which could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results 

 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints variations in manufacturing costs and yields significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry which can be unpredictable and rapid in an efficient and timely manner our operating results could suffer in particular from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand during a downturn our revenue and earnings will suffer 

 

political instability in taiwan and in the people’s republic of china or elsewhere could harm our business 

 

because of our reliance on foundries and independent contractors located in taiwan and the people’s republic of china and because we have offices in these locations our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan including the worsening of the strained relations between the people’s republic of china and taiwan also if relations between the united states and the people’s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events if any of our suppliers experienced a substantial disruption in their operations as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability acts of terrorism or war equipment failure or other cause it could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 115 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because our debt securities are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 

risks related to government action regulatory action intellectual property and litigation 

expensing employee stock options in future periods will materially and aversely affect our reported operating results and could adversely affect our competitive position as well 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments in april 2005 the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 123r which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june 15 2005 sfas no 123r requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 

 

using the fair value of those awards expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings we anticipate that our stockbased compensation expense will be approximately 18 to 22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results which could impact our stock price 

to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

 

we are currently involved in patent litigation which if not resolved favorably could require us to pay damages 

 

we are currently involved in patent litigation on october 19 2004 opti incorporated or opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five united states patents held by opti opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged conduct attorneys fees and triple damages because of our alleged willful infringement of these patents nvidia filed a response to this complaint in december 2004 after a case management conference in july 2005 discovery began and a trial date has now been set for july 2006 a court mandated mediation was held in january 2006 and did not resolve the matter we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 

 

in august 2004 a texas limited partnership named american video graphics lp or avg filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants not including nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas avg initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that avg claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality in november 2004 nvidia sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending avg lawsuits our complaint in intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that to the extent avg’s claims target nvidia products the asserted patents were not infringed 

on december 19 2005 avg and substantially all of the named defendants and intervenors including nvidia settled all of pending claims the only surviving claims will relate solely to two nonsettling defendants as part of the settlement the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount to avg in exchange all pending claims between the settling parties were dismissed with prejudice and avg granted to all settling parties a full release of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of accused products under all of avg’s patents including the patents in suit in addition as part of the settlement all settling defendants and intervenors fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had against any other settling party 

 

our defenses against opti may be unsuccessful if this case goes forward or if other patent litigation matters involving us arise we expect that they will result in additional legal and other costs such as those costs associated with the avg suit regardless of the outcome which could be substantial 

 

our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which could result in significant expense 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation the graphics processor industry in particular has been recently characterized by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions and we expect our competitors and others will continue to aggressively pursue intellectual property positions the technology that we use to design and develop our products and that is incorporated into our products may be subject to claims that it infringes the patents or intellectual property rights of others our success is dependent on our ability to 

 

develop new products without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others or by licensing the intellectual property of third parties as such we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation into our products and expect to continue to enter into license agreements with third parties for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms or at all our competitive position and our business could suffer 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products including our processors we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as by the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 

 

litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 

 

from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition in our product lines intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase we may become involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to these customers in addition litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if infringement claims are made against us we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights in addition we or an indemnified customer may be required to obtain a license to a third parties’ patents or intellectual property however licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly by competitors if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products used by an indemnified customer we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our business furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

alternatively we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights which could be costly if we have to initiate a claim our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results additionally if one of our patents is invalidated or found to be unenforceable we would be unable to license the patent which could result in a loss of revenue 

 

regardless of the outcome litigation or negotiations involving intellectual property rights can be very costly and can divert management’s attention from other matters we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief 

  our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls   

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements this legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

risks related to our common stock 

 

our stock price may continue to experience significant shortterm fluctuations 

 

the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of 

 

factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations any of which could impact our stock price additionally the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are noncompany specific such as the decline in the united states andor international economies acts of terror against the united states war or due to a variety of company specific factors including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results shortfalls in revenue gross margin or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these risk factors 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

 item 3 legal proceedings 

3dfx 

on december 15 2000 nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the 3dfx asset purchase closed on april 18 2001 

 

in may 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s san jose california commercial real estate lease in december 2002 we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s austin texas commercial real estate lease the landlords’ complaints both assert claims for among other things interference with contract successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seek to recover among other things amounts owed on their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately 10 million in october 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california the landlords’ actions were subsequently removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california and consolidated with a complaint filed by the trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case for purposes of discovery upon motion by nvidia in 2005 the district court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court and the landlord actions were removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on november 10 2005 the district court granted nvidias motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints and allowed the landlords to have until february 4 2006 to amend their complaints the landlords’ refiled claims against nvidia in early february 2006 and nvidia again requested the district court to dismiss all such claims made by the landlords a hearing on nvidia’s new motions to dismiss is set for hearing on april 17 2006 discovery is stayed pending this hearing and no trial date has been set in these actions we believe the claims asserted against us by the landlords are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 

in march 2003 we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate the trustee’s complaint asserts claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us on october 13 2005 the court held a hearing on the trustee’s motion for summary adjudication on december 23 2005 the court issued its ruling denying the trustees motion for summary adjudication in all material respects and holding that nvidia is prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx transaction to nvidia was less than 1080 million the court expressly denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia were at least 1080 million in early november 2005 after many months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors’ committee reached a conditional settlement of the trustee’s claims against nvidia this conditional settlement presented as the centerpiece of a proposed plan of liquidation in the bankruptcy case is subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing   the scope and schedule for that confirmation process has yet to be determined but   we expect that hearing to now occur sometime in the next few months the trustee has advised that he intends to object to the settlement the settlement with the creditors’ committee calls for a payment of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million relates to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million relates to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx as such during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx 

the bankruptcy court over objection of the creditors’ committee and nvidia has ordered the discovery portion of the litigation to proceed while the settlement is pending approval through the confirmation process however no trial date has been set in the trustees action in addition following the trustee’s filing of a form 8k on behalf of 3dfx in which the trustee disclosed the terms of the proposed settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor’s committee certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interest’s of 3dfx shareholders that petition was granted and an equity holder’s committee was appointed counsel for the equity holder’s committee has announced an intention to file a competing plan of reorganization or liquidation in the trustee’s case 

opti incorporated 

on october 19 2004 opti incorporated or opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five us patents held by opti opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged conduct attorneys’ fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by nvidia nvidia filed a response to this complaint in december 2004 a case management conference was held in july 2005 where a trial date was set for july 2006 a court mandated mediation was held in january 2006 and did not resolve the matter discovery continues as well as preparation for the markman hearing on claim construction the markman hearing is scheduled for april 13 2006 we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously   we do not have sufficient information to determine whether a loss is probable as such we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such if any loss 

american video graphics 

in august 2004 a texas limited partnership named american video graphics lp or avg filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants not including nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas avg initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that avg claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality in november 2004 nvidia sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending avg lawsuits our complaint in intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that to the extent avg’s claims target nvidia products the asserted patents were not infringed 

on december 19 2005 avg and substantially all of the named defendants and intervenors including nvidia settled all of pending claims the only surviving claims will relate solely to two nonsettling defendants as part of the settlement the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount to avg in exchange all pending claims between the settling parties were dismissed with prejudice and avg granted to all settling parties a full release of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of accused products under all of avg’s patents including the patents in suit in addition as part of the settlement all settling defendants and intervenors fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had against any other settling party 

 

we are subject to other legal proceedings but we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period

issuer purchases of equity securities 

 

on august 9 2004 we announced that our board of directors or the board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock subject to certain specifications up to an aggregate maximum amount of 3000 million as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repurchased 13 million shares of our common stock for 500 million under a structured share repurchase transaction which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we have repurchased 85 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 2132 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for 500 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter

mcp business 

 

in april 2005 we announced the availability of our nvidia nforce4 sli intel corporation or intel edition mcp for intel platforms this line of corelogic solutions incorporates a host of new and innovative features that have never before been available on the intel platform and extends the nvidia nforce brand into new segments in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we shipped the nvidia nforce professional mcp in its first enterprise server platform 

in august 2005 we announced that the nvidia nforce4 sli x16 intel edition technology featured in the dell dimension xps 600 desktop pc was immediately available 

in september 2005 we introduced and shipped the nvidia nforce 400 mcp and geforce 6100 integrated gpu family this represents the first integrated gpu solution to support directx 90 shader model 30 technology we expect this integrated solution to be an important new growth factor for our gpu and mcp businesses 

in december 2005 we announced our intent to acquire uli electronics inc or uli one of the pc industry’s most highly regarded core logic developers on february 20 2006 we completed the acquisition of uli the acquisition represents our ongoing investment in uli’s platform solution strategy and is expected to strengthen our sales marketing and customer engineering presence in taiwan and china 

in january 2006 we shipped the nvidia nforce 4 sli xe and nvidia nforce4 ultra intel mcps these products represent our first discrete chipsets targeted at mainstream intelbased motherboards 

our nvidia nforce product line has achieved record revenue for six consecutive quarters we believe that advanced micro devices’ transition to k8 our extension into new segments and our entry into the intel market with our first ever mainstream intel nforce4 mcps will make our mcp business one of our fastest growing businesses furthermore we believe that our ability to simultaneously innovate using our gpu mcp and software knowledge base will allow us to make additional platform innovations in the future 

handheld gpu business 

 

our strategy in the handheld gpu business is to lead innovation and capitalize on the emergence of the mobile phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle device our initial focus was on 3g cellular phones through the first half of fiscal 2006 our handheld gpu business was heavily concentrated at one original equipment manufacturer or oem and its products did not achieve the anticipated level of commercial success however during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 motorola inc and sony ericsson mobile communications ab launched 3g models of their razr and walkman portable phones respectively that are both powered by our goforce gpus 

our goforce handheld gpus are now shipping in the new motorola 3g razr v3x and the new sony ericsson walkman phones our strategy is to build a new class of low power gpus for multimedia rich devices like 3g cell phones smart phones and portable media players we believe that there will be an increase in demand for mobile video products that deliver compelling and tangible improvements to the overall end user experience of these new services and we believe that we are well positioned to increase our share of the handheld segment in the upcoming year 

consumer electronics business 

 

in april 2005 we finalized our definitive agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation3 and all derivatives including nextgeneration digital consumer electronics devices in addition we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce during fiscal 2006 we recognized 490 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 depending on the ultimate success of this nextgeneration platform we expect to generate starting in fiscal 2007 revenue ranging from 50 million to 100 million annually from license fees and royalties over the next five years with the possibility of additional royalties for several years thereafter we have successfully reached many development milestones and we believe that we are on target to achieve the goals set by sce 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xboxrelated products from us after our second fiscal quarter as a result the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft 

gross margin improvement 

we continue to remain intensely focused on improving our gross margin beginning in fiscal 2005 we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company which were designed to improve business and operational processes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 our gross margin was 402 which represents an increase of 600 basis points from our gross margin of 342 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 our gross margin was 383 for fiscal 2006 which represents an increase of 600 basis points from our gross margin of 323 for fiscal 2005 we believe that we can continue to improve our gross margin during fiscal 2007 

sharebased payment 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our employee compensation packages to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments in april 2005 the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 123r which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june 15 2005 in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 or sab no 107 which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition we intend to adopt sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january 30 2006 the first day of our fiscal 2007 expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings we anticipate that our stockbased compensation expense will be approximately 18 to 22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results which could impact our stock price 

to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

repatriation legislation 

 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 or act was signed into law on october 22 2004 the act provided a temporary incentive for united states multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the united states at a federal effective tax rate of 525 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repatriated 420 million in foreign earnings under the act the net tax effect of this distribution was minimal because the current tax cost at a 525 tax rate was offset by the benefit attributable to reducing our deferred tax liability for taxes on earnings previously provided at the statutory rate of 35 

subsequent events 

uli electronics inc on february 20 2006 we completed the acquisition of uli electronics inc a leading developer of core logic technology for approximately 53 million paid in cash 

stock split on march 6 2006 we issued a press release announcing that our board of directors approved a twoforone stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend the stock split will be effective on or about thursday april 6 2006 for stockholders of record at the close of business on friday march 17 2006 and will entitle each stockholder to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held upon the completion of the stock split nvidia will have approximately 360 million shares of common stock outstanding 

stock repurchase on march 6 2006 we also announced that our board of directors approved an increase in our existing stock repurchase program we announced a 400 million increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in august 2004 as a result of this increase the amount of common stock the board of directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of 700 million the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured stock repurchase transactions in compliance with the securities and exchange commission rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable inventories income taxes and goodwill we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 

 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash 

our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor unclaimed rebates which historically have not been significant are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale 

 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf 019 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products if market conditions decline we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

 

license and development revenue 

 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated to date we have not recorded any such losses costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

 

accounts receivable 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2007 

 

as of january 29 2006 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 06 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 3304 million of the 3304 million 761 million was covered by credit insurance and 366 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 08 during fiscal 2005 and 2006 factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit as of january 29 2006 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at 08 of our gross accounts receivable balance then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january 29 2006 would have been approximately 26 million rather than the actual balance of 06 million 

inventories 

 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin as of january 29 2006 our inventory reserve was 483 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 88 and 159 during fiscal 2005 and 2006 as of january 29 2006 our inventory reserve represented 159 of our gross inventory balance inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

 

income taxes 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

 

as of january 29 2006 we had a valuation allowance of 2307 million of the total valuation allowance 1822 million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if and when realized will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity of the remaining valuation allowance at january 29 2006 195 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes and 290 million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero then reduce other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 

goodwill 

 

our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test we performed our analysis on a reporting unit basis we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and concluded that there was no impairment however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with such tests 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 

 

fiscal years ended january 29 2006 january 30 2005 and january 25 2004 

revenue 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we reorganized our operating segments to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies we now report financial information for four productline operating segments to our chief executive officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or codm as follows the gpu business the mcp business the handheld gpu business and the consumer electronics business revenue in the “all other” category is primarily derived from sales of memory please refer to note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

fiscal 2005 was a 53week year compared to fiscal 2006 and 2004 which were 52week years and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005 however we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our revenue 

fiscal year 2006 vs fiscal year 2005 

 

revenue was 24 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to 20 billion for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 182 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 226 to 17 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to 14 billion for fiscal 2005 the increase was the result of increased sales of our geforce 6 and geforce 7 families of desktop gpus that serve the highend gpu segment offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream gpu products in addition sales of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of geforce 6based and geforce 7based products which resulted in an increase in average selling prices 

mcp business  mcp business revenue was 3523 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 1757 million for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 1006 the overall increase in mcp business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of nvidia nforce4 products which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and an increase in average selling prices the overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce2 products 

  handheld gpu business  handheld gpu business revenue was 587 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 459 million for fiscal 2005 which represents an increase of 279 the overall increase in handheld gpu business revenue is due to an increase in average selling prices of highend feature phone products and revenue recognized as a result of a development contract 

 

consumer electronics business  consumer electronics business revenue was 1702 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 2600 million for fiscal 2005 which represents a decrease of 345 the decrease in our consumer electronics business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our xboxrelated products to microsoft partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with sce during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xboxrelated products from us after our second fiscal quarter as a result the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xboxrelated products to microsoft during fiscal 2006 we recognized 490 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our nextgeneration geforce gpu and sce’s system solutions in sce’s playstation3 no such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with sce was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

fiscal year 2005 vs fiscal year 2004 

revenue was 20 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 18 billion in fiscal 2004 which represented an increase of 103 fiscal 2005 was a 53week year compared to fiscal 2004 which was a 52week year 

 

gpu business  gpu business revenue increased by 71 to 14 billion for fiscal 2005 compared to 13 billion for fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products in fiscal 2005 which was due to unit sales volume increases and an increase in average selling prices as a result of increased board sales notebook gpu sales increased in fiscal 2005 as a result of sales of our geforce fx go notebook gpu products outpacing the decline in our older notebook gpu product lines during the period sales of desktop products increased in fiscal 2005 as a result of a significant increase in sales of our highend desktop products offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop products highend desktop sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our geforce 6800 and 6600 products the decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream segment offset by the ramp of product sales of our geforce 6200 with turbocache technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

mcp business  mcp business revenue increased by 81 to 1757 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 1624 million for fiscal 2004 the increase in mcp business revenue is due to increased sales of nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce4 products nvidia nforce4 products began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 this increase was offset by a decrease in sales of nvidia nforce2 products 

handheld gpu business  handheld gpu business revenue increased by 4097 to 459 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 90 million for fiscal 2004 the increase in handheld gpu sales in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of mediaq inc in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 which represented our initial entry into the handheld segment and to sales of our goforce 4000 product 

consumer electronics business  consumer electronics business revenue decreased by 72 to 2600 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 2801 million for fiscal 2004 the decrease in our consumer electronics business is due to unit sales volume increases offset by a lower average sales price sales of our xbox products historically fluctuated based on the timing of orders from microsoft 

 

concentration of revenue 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 84 76 and 75 of total revenue for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems’ addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to decreased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product which were billed to microsoft in the united states 

sales to our two largest customers accounted for approximately 26 31 and 36 of our revenue during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

gross profit 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold   our gross margin was 383 323 and 290 for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows 

 

fiscal year 2006 vs fiscal year 2005 

gpu business  the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the sale of our geforce 7 series gpus and increased sales of our geforce 6 series gpus which collectively now account for approximately 78 of our gpu business revenue our geforce 7 and our geforce 6 series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our geforce fx series gpus which comprised 53 of our

fiscal year 2005 vs fiscal year 2004

mcp business  the gross margin of our mcp business increased during the fiscal 2005 as compared fiscal 2004 primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce4 products which to date have experienced higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia nforce products

consolidated gross margin 

the improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth we expect gross margin to improve by approximately 05 to 10 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

operating expenses 

research and development   

 

research and development expenses increased by 170 million or 5 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 324 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 423 additional personnel and a 53 million increase in computer software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses other expenses increased 39 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the 

 

expansion of our international sites depreciation and amortization increased 21 million due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased 06 million due to increased facilities expense allocation both of which were based on the growth in headcount these increases were offset by an increase of 269 million in license and development project costs primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with sce and other engineering costs related to a different development contract as a portion of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have been focusing their efforts on these development projects the costs associated with these individuals are not charged to research and development but were charged to cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized as cost of revenue on a percentage of completion basis 

research and development expenses increased by 651 million or 24 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to a 360 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 174 additional personnel and a 104 million increase in new product development costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tapeouts and in prototype materials depreciation and amortization increased 115 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2004 resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2005 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004 computer software and equipment increased 42 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased 31 million due to increased facilities expense allocation both of which were based on the growth in headcount other expenses increased 19 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites these increases were offset by an increase of 20 million in license and development project costs related to our collaboration with sce that are classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis our collaboration with sce was not in effect during fiscal 2004 

we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

sales general and administrative 

 

sales general and administrative expenses increased 36 million or 2 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 138 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a 61 million increase 

 

in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx interactive inc or 3dfx and american video graphics or avg in addition there were increases of 29 million in facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites and 25 million in other general and administrative expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense these increases were offset by a 172 million decrease in advertising and promotion costs primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing programs tradeshow expenses new product launches and customer samples other marketing costs travel related and employee recruitment expenses and by a 45 million decrease in depreciation and amortization 

sales general and administrative expenses increased 356 million or 22 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an 184 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 88 additional personnel and a 194 million increase in advertising and promotion costs for tradeshows and new product launches and other marketing costs including travel and customer samples these increases were offset by a decrease of 19 million in other expenses during the period including a reduction in bad debt expense 

operating expenses 

we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in addition to the headcount additions that we plan to make we will be adding the operating costs related to the acquisition of uli which closed on february 20 2006 we expect that these factors will result in an increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 in addition the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will be the first time that we include stockbased employee compensation expense under statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment in our results we anticipate that our stockbased compensation expense will be approximately 18 to 22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

inprocess research and development   

in connection with our acquisition of mediaq in august 2003 we wroteoff 35 million of inprocess research and development expense or iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin 4 applicability of sfas no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of sfas no 2  amounts assigned to iprd meeting the abovestated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 

settlement costs 

settlement costs were 142 million for fiscal 2006 the settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters 3dfx and avg avg is settled the 3dfx matter is not finally settled and is subject to judicial review and the completion of appropriate procedures and documents however based on the potential settlement in this case we have concluded that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss please refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income increased from 114 million to 207 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 interest income decreased from 186 million to 114 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the result of lower overall balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and due to lower market interest rates 

interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and prior to the redemption in october 2003 interest on the convertible subordinated debentures or the notes interest expense decreased from 120 million to 02 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of the notes 

other income expense net 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities other income decreased by 11 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 other income decreased by 24 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to 25 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the notes in october 2003 this decrease was offset by a 10 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related to the receipt of cash and marketable securities as part of an investment exchange 

income taxes 

we recognized income tax expense of 576 million 251 million and 123 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 160 in fiscal 2006 200 in fiscal 2005 and 141 in fiscal 2004 

the difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years is primarily attributable to changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax 

 

please refer to note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense 

 

convertible debenture redemption expense 

on october 24 2003 we fully redeemed the notes the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding was 3000 million which included 186 million of notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended october 26 2003 the redemption price was equal to approximately 1027 of the outstanding principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the redemption date in connection with the redemption of the notes we recorded a onetime charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately 131 million which included a 76 million redemption premium and 55 million of unamortized issuance costs

primarily due to an increase in rebates payable which resulted from increased oem business accounts payable increased 529 million primarily due to purchases from subcontract manufacturers for inventory offsetting these increases our accounts receivable increased 996 million primarily due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004

stock repurchase program 

 

on august 9 2004 we announced that our board of directors or the board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock subject to certain specifications up to an aggregate maximum amount of 3000 million as part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions these agreements generally require that we make an upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock within a predetermined range at the end of the term of the agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repurchased 13 million shares of our common stock for 500 million under a structured share repurchase transaction which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we have repurchased 85 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of 2132 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for 500 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

·   decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers’ products 

·   inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products 

·   competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and 

·   new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

for additional factors see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our operations  our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline”

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments in april 2005 the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 123r which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june 15 2005 in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 or sab no 107 which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition we intend to adopt sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january 30 2006 the first day of our fiscal 2007 expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings we anticipate that our stockbased compensation expense will be approximately 18 to 22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results which could impact our stock price 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we transitioned from a blackscholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stockbased compensation awards granted under our stock option plans as a result of recent regulatory guidance including sab no 107 and in anticipation of the impending effective date of sfas no 123r we reevaluated the assumptions we use to estimate the value of employee stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan beginning with stock options granted and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in our first quarter of fiscal 2006 we determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility additionally in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to make full use of the capabilities of the binomial valuation model as such the expected term is based on detailed historical data about employees exercise behavior vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we believe the resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options for our employee stock purchase plan we decided to continue to use the blackscholes model to calculate the estimated fair value 

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 or sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3  sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes 

 

in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle we will adopt sfas 154 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2005 the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force’s or eitf’s issue no 0506 or eitf no 0506 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements  eitf no 0506 provides that the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease be the shorter of a the useful life of the assets or b a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase the provisions of eitf no 0506 are effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired we adopted eitf no 0506 during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in november 2005 the fasb issued staff position or fsp fas11511241 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 124 accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations  and apb opinion no 18 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we will adopt this fsp during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we do not believe the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas123r3 transition election to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additionalpaidincapital pool as prescribed in sfas no 123r sharebased payment  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp an entity that adopts sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application may make a onetime election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 123r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its onetime election this fsp became effective in november 2005 we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this fsp could have on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

as of january 29 2006 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both  05 would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 26 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and wmps for pcs handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry’s respective oems odms system integrators motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

in the gpu and mcp segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system integrators and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel in the wmp segments we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production currently we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world 

as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to edom technology co ltd or edom accounted for 18 and sales to microsoft accounted for 13 of our total revenue for fiscal 2005 edom is an independent distributor 

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes products available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

seasonality 

our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market due to the seasonality in this market we typically expect to see stronger revenue growth in the second half of the calendar year related to the backtoschool and holiday seasons 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a “fabless” manufacturing strategy for all productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc international business machines corporation or ibm chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered and united microelectronics corporation or umc to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging of our products 

our gpus mcps and wmps are assembled tested and packaged by advanced semiconductor engineering amkor technology stats chippac incorporated and siliconware precision industries company ltd we receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to cems distributors motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our santa clara california warehouse and thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship the products to retailers system integrators or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions 

 

inventory and working capital 

  our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on this forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because t he semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

research and development 

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics high definition video audio ultralow power communications storage and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and wmps using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration or vlsi design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc manufacturers 

we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal 2004 and have 1231 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 30 2005 compared to 1057 employees as of january 25 2004 during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we incurred research and development expenditures of 3351 million 2700 million and 2249 million respectively 

competition 

the market for gpus mcps and wmps for pcs handhelds and consumer electronics is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of digital media processors and total system costs of addin boards or motherboards we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 

we expect substantial competition from intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products such as the centrino platform an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and wmp solutions for the pc consumer electronics and handheld segments our competitors include the following 









if and to the extent we offer products outside of the pc consumer electronics and handheld segments we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new segments we may enter 

patents and proprietary rights 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our issued patents have expiration dates from september 4 2007 to december 11 2022 we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products including our digital media processors we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions the location in which our products are manufactured our strategic technology or product directions in different countries and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

employees 

as of january 30 2005 we had 2101 employees 1231 of whom were engaged in research and development and 870 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good

on october 19 2004 opti incorporated or opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five united states patents held by opti opti seeks unspecified damages for our conduct attorneys fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by nvidia nvidia filed a response to this complaint in december 2004 discovery has not begun and no trial date has been set we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 

american video graphics 

in august 2004 a texas limited partnership named american video graphics lp or avg filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants not including nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas avg initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that avg claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality each of the three lawsuits targeted a different group of defendants one case involves approximately twenty of the leading personal computer manufacturers the pc makers case one case involves the three leading video game console makers the game console case and one case involves approximately ten of the leading video game publishers the game publishers case in november 2004 nvidia sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending avg lawsuits the pc makers case and the game console case nvidia’s complaint in intervention alleges both that the patents in suit are invalid and that to the extent avg’s claims target nvidia products the asserted patents are not infringed two other leading suppliers of graphics processing products intel and ati have also intervened in the cases ati in both the pc makers and game console case and intel in the pc makers case 

after some consensual reconfigurations proposed by the various parties in january 2005 the district court judge entered docket control and discovery orders in the three lawsuits the pc makers case now involves four separate patents and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on september 11 2006 the game console case involves a single patent and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on december 4 2006 we believe that to the extent avg’s infringement allegations target functionality that may be performed by nvidia products those claims are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves and our products vigorously 

we are subject to other legal proceedings but we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period

intel crosslicense agreement 

on november 19 2004 nvidia and intel announced that the companies signed a broad multiyear patent crosslicense agreement spanning multiple product lines and product generations additionally the companies signed a multiyear chipset agreement granting nvidia a license to implement intels frontside bus technology we believe that this agreement opens a significant opportunity for us to bring our nvidia nforce brand to the intel segment we expect to commence shipments of our first intelbased mcp product during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

geforce 6 series 

in april 2004 we announced our latest flagship gpu architecture the geforce 6 series the geforce 6 series offers a number of new features including a faster architecture than our geforce fx series compliance with many of the latest software standards and onchip video processors for highdefinition encoding and decoding and directtotelevision playback the geforce 6 series offers more flexibility for game designers and graphic artists while increasing performance over our previous topend product the geforce fx 5950 during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we launched the production shipment of the geforce 6800 ultra 6800 gt and 6800 the industry’s first gpus to support microsoft’s directx 9 shader model 30 during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we launched the production shipment of the geforce 6600 gt and 6600 which are intended for the mainstream market and the geforce 6200 which delivers the geforce 6 series architecture and performance to the value pc segment in december 2004 we introduced a version of the geforce 6200 with turbocache technology nvidia turbocache technology is a new patent pending hardware and software technology which allows a gpu to render directly to system memory instead of using local memory on the graphics card many of the world’s leading pc oems system builders and addin card partners have announced plans to build systems and graphics cards utilizing the geforce 6200 with turbocache technology 

in december 2004 we announced nvidia purevideo technology which brings consumer electronics quality video to pcs purevideo technology eliminates the need for separate hardware or chipsets and takes the load off the pc’s multipurpose cpu new notebooks and media centers powered by geforce 6 with purevideo technology are expected to be introduced to the market soon 

peripheral component interconnect express or pci express 

the transition to pci express was central to our gpu and mcp objectives during fiscal 2005 industry adoption of pci express was slower than expected during our fiscal 2005 

in february 2004 we announced a toptobottom family of pci express gpus by using a pci express highspeed interconnect or hsi which is a complex piece of networking technology that performs highspeed bidirectional interconnect protocol conversion we were able to transform our geforce family of gpus into pci express compatible gpus in june 2004 we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of gpus ready to support pci express chipsets our first pci express graphics solutions the geforce pcx series were released for retail sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 in september 2004 we announced the geforce 6600 gt and the geforce 6600 in october 2004 we announced the geforce 6200 our first native pci express gpus in november 2004 we announced the launch of geforce go 6800 gpu our first native pci express gpu for notebook pcs 

in may 2004 we announced the mobile pci express module specification or mxm mxm was jointly developed by nvidia and leading notebook pc manufacturers in an effort to accelerate the adoption of pci expressbased notebooks in all market segments mxm is an open design specification that supports a wide range of graphics solutions from any gpu manufacturer allowing system integrators maximum flexibility for buildtoorder with various graphics solutions mxm also serves as the primary delivery vehicle for our geforce go 6 series of gpus 

in august 2004 we announced that pcisig the special interest group responsible for conventional pci pcix and pci express industrystandard io technologies had added our pci express technologybased products to the pcisig integrators list including gpus designed for workstations desktop pcs and notebook pcs 

in february 2005 we announced the nvidia quadro fx go 1400 mobile gpu for pci express which provides the performance programmability precision and quality that cad dcc and scientific applications require 

wmp business 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 motorola inc announced their decision to incorporate our goforce 4000 in their upcoming new line of 3g multimedia phones in july 2004 we announced that samsung electronics co or samsung had selected our goforce 2100 media processor for the schm500 mobile intelligent terminal by samsung or mits phone we now have design wins with three of the worlds top five cellular phone oems  motorola samsung and lg electronics inc in september 2004 we unveiled the goforce 3d 4500 the worlds first 3d wmp in february 2005 we announced the goforce 3d 4800 over the next several years we expect digital media processing technology to play a critical role in the cellular phone industry 

scalable link interface technology 

in june 2004 we unveiled a new scalable link interface or sli technology that takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the pci express bus architecture to allow two nvidiabased graphics cards to operate in a single pc or workstation pci expressbased pcs and workstations based on nvidia sli technology became available in the second half of fiscal 2005 from pc and workstation manufacturers 

 

nvidia nforce 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we launched production of the nvidia nforce3 250gb mcp the first singlechip mcp to offer gigabit ethernet dual independent serial advanced technology attachment or sata controllers industry leading redundant array of independent disks or raid features and hardware security processing in june 2004 we announced the release of the nvidia nforce3 ultra mcp a mcp for motherboards and pc systems based on the amd64 computing platform in october 2004 we introduced the nvidia nforce4 mcps our new family of highend pci expressbased mcps for amd64 computing environments nvidia nforce4 mcps provide the platform technology that is designed to power this years fastest gaming enthusiast and digital media pcs and motherboards driving the pci express transition 

in january 2005 we introduced nvidia nforce professional mcps which currently are the only pci express corelogic solutions for amd opteron processorbased server and workstation platforms the nvidia nforce professional mcp family includes the nvidia nforce professional 2200 and the 2050 mcp 

sharebased payment 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment  or sfas no 123r sfas no 123r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 and requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs 

repatriation legislation 

 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law on october 22 2004 this act creates a temporary incentive for united states multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the united states at a federal effective tax rate of 525 on december 21 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004  which allows an enterprise time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings   we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision however we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision we have not provided for united states income taxes on a cumulative total of approximately 1747 million of undistributed earnings as of january 30 2005 for certain nonunited states subsidiaries as we intended to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the united states we are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not and to what extent if any this provision may benefit us we expect to complete such evaluation before the end of fiscal 2006 the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and 500 million the potential range of related income tax expense is between zero and 27 million 

future objectives and challenges 

gpu business 

during fiscal 2005 we committed ourselves to recapture technology leadership in our gpu business while creating an architecture that is cost efficient with our geforce 6 family we captured a significant share of the performance gpu segment and we are now focused on using that technology leadership position into the mainstream and value gpu segments by the end of fiscal 2005 we had a toptobottom product line that supports shader model 30 and with sli mxm hsi turbocache technology and purevideo technology now we are focused on growing our gpu business 

 

pci express 

pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking the transition to pci express which is extremely complex is central to our gpu and mcp objectives this fiscal year we initiated this transition by creating our geforce pcx series of gpus using hsi technology during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of gpus ready to support pci express chipsets the transition to pci express was central to our gpu and mcp objectives during fiscal 2005 industry adoption of pci express was slower than expected during our fiscal 2005 and there is no assurance that the adoption rate will increase during fiscal 2006 our first pci express graphics solutions the geforce pcx series was released for retail sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we expected to ramp up sales of our pci express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 but as a result of intel’s delayed pci express chipset production followed by its product recall the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our geforce pcx gpus during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we announced and ramped up sales of the geforce 6600 gt geforce 6600 and the geforce 6200 our first native pci express gpus 

gross margin improvement 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 our gross margin was 342 an increase of 49 from our gross margin of 293 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 our gross margin was 323 for fiscal 2005 an increase of 33 from our gross margin of 290 for fiscal 2004 these improvements in our gross margin reflect our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures enhancing business processes and driving profitable growth we expect gross margin to improve by approximately 05 to 10 during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as our geforce 6 product family becomes an increasing portion of our revenue and as our nvidia nforce3 and nvidia nforce4 product revenue continues to increase 

wmp business 

our wmp objective is to lead the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products that use our expertise resources and investments in digital media processing combined with our low power technology our wmp business achieved record revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and is expected to achieve substantial revenue levels in fiscal 2006 with the wmps on our roadmap we anticipate that future cellular phones will be able to receive television programs record digital video like a camcorder enable video phone calls and be portable game players 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable inventories longlived assets goodwill income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 

 

revenue recognition 

product revenue 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for all sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash 

 

 

our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 

 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor unclaimed rebates which historically have not been significant are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale 

 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf 019 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products if market conditions decline we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

 

license and development revenue 

 

for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize license revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting over the period that services are performed for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated to date we have not recorded any such losses costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed to customers the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 

 

investment impairments 

we review all of our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects factors related to the investee’s ability remain in business such as the investee’s liquidity and the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 

investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value when an investee is not considered viable from a financial point of view we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise impairments of investments in our portfolio primarily impairments of nonmarketable equity securities were nil in fiscal 2005 and 2004 

accounts receivable 

 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2005 

 

as of january 30 2005 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 15 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 3362 million of the 3362 million 680 million was covered by credit insurance and 224 million was covered by letters of credit as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 04 and 15 during fiscal 2004 and 2005 as of january 30 2005 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 04 of our gross accounts receivable balance if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at 15 of our gross accounts receivable balance then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january 30 2005 would have been approximately 49 million rather than the actual balance of 15 million 

inventories 

 

inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin as of january 30 2005 our inventory reserve was 337 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 88 and 134 during fiscal 2004 and 2005 as of january 30 2005 our inventory reserve represented 96 of our gross inventory balance if our inventory reserve would have been recorded at 134 of our gross inventory balance then our inventory reserve balance at january 30 2005 would have been approximately 468 million rather than the actual balance of 337 million inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

 

valuation of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we utilize a twostep approach to testing longlived assets for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment indicators if an impairment indicator is present the second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset our review requires the use of judgment and estimates no such impairment charges have occurred to date however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable 

 

goodwill 

 

our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our stateme nt of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairm ent test we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test the second step if necessary measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and concluded that there was no impairment however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with such tests 

 

income taxes 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements 

 

as of january 30 2005 we had a valuation allowance of 1906 million of the total valuation allowance 1457 million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if and when realization is sustained will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity of the remaining valuation allowance at january 30 2005 199 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not more likely than not to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes and 250 million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined are not more likely than not to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero then reduce other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 

contingencies 

 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 



fiscal years ended january 30 2005 january 25 2004 and january 26 2003 

revenue 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we began reporting three productline operating segments the gpu business which is composed of products that support desktop pcs notebook pcs and professional workstations the mcp business which is composed of nvidia nforce products and xbox related products and the wmp business which is comprised of goforce products that support handheld personal digital assistants and cellular phones please refer to note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

revenue was 201 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 182 billion in fiscal 2004 which represented an increase of 10 the revenue increase from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increased sales of our nvidia quadro workstation products increased memory sales increased sales of our handheld products increased sales of our notebook gpu products and increased sales of our desktop products offset by decreased sales of our xbox products the increase in sales of our nvidia quadro workstation products in fiscal 2005 was due to unit sales volume increases and an increase in average selling prices as a result of increased board sales the increase in memory sales in fiscal 2005 was a result of the alignment of memory sales with the introduction of our geforce 6 products during the period the increase in handheld sales in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of mediaq inc in october 2003 which represented our initial entry into the handheld market and to sales of our goforce 4000 product the increase in notebook gpu sales in fiscal 2005 resulted from sales of our geforce fx go notebook gpu products outpacing the decline in our older notebook gpu product lines during the period the increase in desktop products in fiscal 2005 was a result of a significant increase in sales of our highend desktop products offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop products highend desktop sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our geforce 6800 and 6600 products the decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream consumer segment offset by the ramp of product sales of our geforce 6200 with turbocache technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 sales of our xbox products have historically fluctuated based on the timing of orders from microsoft revenue from sales to microsoft in fiscal 2005 was slightly lower than fiscal 2004 due to unit sales volume increases offset by a lower average sales price during fiscal 2004 microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from microsoft is uncertain but we anticipate that we will not achieve historical levels of xbox revenue in fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2005 was a 53week year compared to fiscal 2004 which was a 52week year and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005 however we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our revenue 

revenue was 182 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 191 billion in fiscal 2003 which represented a decrease of 5 this revenue decrease was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of xbox processors to microsoft offset by growth in our gpu mcp and wmp products 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 76 75 and 68 of total revenue for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product which are billed to microsoft in the united states 

sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue for fiscal 2005 our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 36 of our revenue for fiscal 2005 sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 15 of our revenue for fiscal 2004 our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 45 of our revenue for fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 23 of our revenue our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 41 of our revenue for fiscal 2003 

gross profit 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold 

our gross margin was 32 29 and 30 in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively gross margin improved during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of three primary factors first during fiscal 2004 our geforce fx series of gpu products had experienced lower gross margins than previous series of geforce gpu products such as the geforce 4 series companywide efforts were made to drive down cost and improve gross margin and as a result during fiscal 2005 we were able to improve our gross margin in addition in fiscal 2005 we realized increased sales of our performance geforce fx desktop gpu products and began shipping our geforce 6 series gpus which are among our highest gross margin products finally revenue from our nvidia quadro workstation products which typically provide the highest gross margins of any of our products increased as a percentage of our total revenue during fiscal 2005 this increase in our mix of revenue toward highermargin products led to a positive impact on overall gross margin these improvements in our gross margin reflect our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architecture enhancing business process and driving profitable growth we expect gross margin to improve by approximately 05 to 10 during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as our geforce 6 product family comprises an increasing portion of our revenue and as nvidia nforce product revenue continues to increase 

gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our geforce fx products our geforce fx products generally experienced lower gross margins than previous geforce products this decrease was offset by an increase in gross margin on sales of xbox processors in fiscal 2004 which resulted from the pricing settlement with microsoft that we announced on february 6 2003 

 

operating expenses 

research and development   



research and developments expenses increased by 651 million or 24 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to a 340 million increase related to 174 additional personnel and a 104 million increase in new product developments costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tapeouts and in prototype materials depreciation and amortization increased 115 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2004 resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2005 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004 computer software and equipment increased 42 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased 31 million due to increased facilities expense allocation both based on the growth in headcount 

research and development expenses increased by 451 million or 20 from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 332 million increase related to additional personnel including approximately 60 employees that we hired as a part of our acquisition of mediaq and a 177 million increase in depreciation and amortization offset by a 104 million decrease in new product development costs 

we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

 

sales general and administrative 



sales general and administrative expenses increased 356 million or 22 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an 184 million increase related to 88 additional personnel and a 194 million increase in advertising and promotion costs for tradeshows and new product launches and other marketing costs including travel and customer samples these increases were offset by a decrease of 19 million in other expenses during the period including a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts 

sales general and administrative expenses increased 137 million or 9 from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 129 million increase in salaries and related benefits related to additional personnel a 76 million increase in advertising and promotions costs for tradeshows and marketing development and a 32 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equipment these increases were offset by a 74 million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that have since been resolved including an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission the microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits 

inprocess research and development   

in connection with our acquisition of mediaq in august 2003 we wroteoff 35 million of inprocess research and development expense or iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin 4 applicability of sfas no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of sfas no 2    amounts assigned to iprd meeting the abovestated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 

 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income decreased from 186 million to 114 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the result of lower overall balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and due to lower market interest rates interest income decreased from 232 million to 186 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower overall balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 this overall decrease was caused by the redemption of our 3000 million 4¾ convertible subordinated debentures due 2007 or the notes in october 2003 

 

interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and prior to the redemption in october 2003 interest on the notes interest expense decreased from 120 million to 02 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 interest expense decreased from 165 million to 120 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 these decreases were primarily due to the redemption of the notes 

other income expense net 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities other income decreased by 24 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to 25 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the notes in october 2003 this decrease was offset by a 10 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related to the receipt of cash and marketable securities as part of an investment exchange 

stock option exchange 

on september 26 2002 we commenced an offer or the offer to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than 2700 per share or eligible options the offer was implemented in order to improve employee morale by realigning the cash and equity components of our compensation programs eliminate significant outofthemoney options and reduce the number of outstanding stock options relative to the number of shares outstanding or options overhang thereby reducing future potential dilution to existing stockholders stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20615000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the offer representing approximately 39 of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date of the offer only employees of nvidia or one of our subsidiaries as of september 26 2002 who continued to be employees through the offer termination date of october 24 2002 were eligible to participate in the offer employees who were on medical maternity worker’s compensation military or other statutorily protected leaves of absence or a personal leave of absence were also eligible to participate in the offer employees who were terminated on or before the offer termination date of october 24 2002 were not eligible to participate in the offer in addition our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in this offer 

eligible employees who participated in the offer received in exchange for the cancellation of eligible options a fixed amount of consideration represented by fully vested nonforfeitable common stock less applicable withholding taxes equal to the number of shares underlying such eligible options multiplied by 320 less the amount of applicable tax withholdings divided by 1046 the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on october 24 2002 we concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by issue 39f of eitf issue no 0023 issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 25 and fasb interpretation no 44 as the 320 per eligible option was at least the fair value for each eligible option as determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the blackscholes optionpricing model we used the following assumptions i the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options which was approximately 78 years ii a volatility of 500 during the expected life iii a riskfree interest rate of 371 and iv no dividends the amount of 320 per eligible option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period 

variable accounting is not required under issue 39a of eitf issue no 0023 for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation because i the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and nonforfeitable and ii the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by 320 divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange we further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of fasb interpretation no 44 paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation based on the terms of the offer variable accounting is not required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the offer we did not grant stock options to any participants in the offer for at least six months following october 24 2002 if any stock options were granted to participants in the offer within the six months following october 24 2002 those stock options would have received variable accounting 

 

on october 24 2002 the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18843000 eligible options for total consideration of 618 million consisting of 399 million in fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock approximately 3815000 shares and 219 million in employer and employee related taxes the number of fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of our common stock on october 24 2002 of 1046 per share 

the shares of our common stock issued in exchange for eligible options were fully vested however a portion of the shares equal to 25 of the total consideration based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer termination date have a six month holding period and a portion of the shares equal to 25 of such total consideration have a one year holding period withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50 of the total consideration and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction 

income taxes 

we recognized income tax expense of 251 million 123 million and 598 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 20 in fiscal 2005 141 in fiscal 2004 and 397 in fiscal 2003 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 we revised our annual effective tax rate for the year from 30 to 20 the change in rate was primarily due to federal and state tax credits and foreign tax rate differentials in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 we had significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate which included the 35 million mediaq iprd writeoff for which no tax benefit was recognized the 750 million income tax benefit of certain tax contingencies as a result of settlement of our federal income tax return exam by the internal revenue service or irs the 382 million income tax expense for the accrual of united states deferred income taxes on previous permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the 336 million income tax expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not the be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income as a result of this change in rate and the special items incurred during 2004 our annual effective tax rate for such year was 141 in fiscal 2003 we did not record an income tax benefit for the third quarter loss before income tax expense as such loss was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no income tax benefit may have been available as a result our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 397 

as of january 25 2004 the irs closed our federal income tax return exam for our fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2005 the joint committee on taxation or the joint committee completed its review of our irs exam for these fiscal years and closed such exam with no exception to the conclusions reached by the irs accordingly the results of our exam as recorded in our financial statements for fiscal 2004 accurately reflected our final settlement reached with the irs that was subsequently closed without exception by the joint committee during fiscal 2005 

 

please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense 

 

convertible debenture redemption expense 

on october 24 2003 we fully redeemed the notes the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding was 3000 million which included 186 million of notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended october 26 2003 the redemption price was equal to approximately 1027 of the outstanding principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the redemption date in connection with the redemption of the notes we recorded a onetime charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately 131 million which included a 76 million redemption premium and 55 million of unamortized issuance costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of january 30 2005 we had 6700 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 660 million from the end of fiscal 2004 our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions our investment policy requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration 

 

operating activities generated cash of 1322 million 497 million and 2650 million during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily related to the 259 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet accrued liabilities increased 373 million primarily due to an increase in rebates payable which resulted from increased oem business accounts payable increased 529 million primarily due to purchases from subcontract manufacturers for inventory offsetting these increases our accounts receivable increased 1011 million primarily due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

 

investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities purchases of property and equipment which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets investing activities used cash of 1520 million and provided cash of 880 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to 847 million of net purchases of marketable securities in addition we used 673 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus new research and development emulation equipment technology licenses software and intangible assets we expect to spend approximately 50 million to 70 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2006 primarily for purchases of software licenses emulation equipment computer and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

 

financing activities provided cash of 138 million during fiscal 2005 compared to cash used of 2703 million during fiscal 2004 cash provided in fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from 425 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans offset by 246 million related to our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2004 the cash used was primarily due to the 3000 million redemption of the notes which included 186 million of notes that we had purchased during the three months ended october 26 2003 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

on august 9 2004 we announced a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 3000 million of our common stock over a three year period through august 2007 the repurchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with rule 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion the repurchases will be funded from our available working capital during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 21 million shares for a total cost of approximately 246 million we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

 

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 









for additional factors see “business risks  risks related to our operations  our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline” 

 

shelf registration statement 

 

in december 2003 we filed a form s3 with the sec under its shelf registration process this shelf registration was declared effective by the sec on march 25 2004 under this shelf registration statement we may sell common stock preferred stock debt securities warrants stock purchase contracts andor stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of 5000 million unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes 

 

3dfx asset purchase 

the 3dfx asset purchase closed on april 18 2001 under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets we are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfx’s subsequent bankruptcy in october 2002 please refer to item 3 legal proceedings for further information regarding this litigation 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of january 30 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 



 

1 represents our inventory purchase commitments as of january 30 2005 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2004 the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force issue no 031 or eitf 031 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 031 provides guidance for identifying impaired investments and new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired on september 30 2004 the fasb issued a final staff position eitf issue 0311 that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs 10 through 20 of eitf 031 quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by eitf 031 remain effective for fiscal 2005 we do not believe the impact of adoption of this eitf consensus will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in november 2004 the fasb issued no 151 or sfas no 151 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas no 151 amends arb no 43 chapter 4 to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges in addition sfas no 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provision of sfas no 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 or sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets — an amendment of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  sfas no 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas no 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 153 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation payments sfas no 123r is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 123r on our operating results and financial condition the adoption of the sfas no 123r fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas no 123r cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the fair value and number of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation   assuming the application of the blackscholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the subheading “stockbased compensation ” sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

 

business risks 

 

in addition to the risks discussed in “item 1 business” and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is subject to the risks set forth below 

 

risks related to our operations 

 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory or conversely may result in inadequate inventory levels either of which could adversely affect our financial results 

 

inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future in forecasting demand we must make multiple assumptions which may prove to be incorrect if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to writedown our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected additionally if we fail to estimate customer demand properly before a new product is introduced we may end up with excess inventory levels of older products which could result in writedowns of the value of our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 demand for our non pci express mainstream desktop products declined significantly due in large part to unexpected competitive pricing actions taken by our competition as a result of these competitive pricing actions we were required to reduce the average selling prices of certain of our mainstream desktop products and our gross margin was adversely affected if such competitive pricing actions were to recur in the future we could be forced to continue to reduce average selling prices or to writedown our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected conversely if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner inability to fill our customers orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation 

 

we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand therefore we have limited ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

 

substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than longterm agreements as a result we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major original equipment manufacturers or oems additionally because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results 

 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively impact our business 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees none of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with our officers and employees are at will we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our executive officers technical personnel or other key employees particularly jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer would harm our business our success will depend on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business the integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 

 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing andor new products would reduce our gross margin 

 

semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 

because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation our revenue and our gross profit our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation and result in customers working with our competitors 

to stay competitive we may have to invest more resources in research and development 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1231 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 30 2005 compared to 1057 employees as of january 25 2004 during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 research and development expenditures represented 17 15 and 12 as a percentage of revenue respectively if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue our operating results would decline we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 

 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may have limited ability to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

during fiscal 2005 and 2004 our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 27 and 24 of our total revenue respectively since we typically recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls it would negatively impact our financial results 

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively 

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we currently use 015 micron 014 micron 013 micron and 011 micron process technologies for our family of gpus mcps and wmps the majority of our newest gpus the geforce 6 series geforce fx and the geforce fx go products are manufactured in 013 micron and 011 micron process technology 

 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we may face similar difficulties delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes moreover we are dependent on our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully the inability by us or our thirdparty manufacturers to transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and negatively impact our gross margin 

 

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

 

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline perhaps substantially for example on august 5 2004 we announced that the operating results for our second quarter of fiscal 2005 included significantly lower amounts of revenue and earnings per share than had been expected by securities analysts our announcement was followed by a decline in the trading price of our common stock conversely on february 17 2005 we announced better than expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 this announcement was followed by an increase in the price of our common stock we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

 

factors that have affected our results of operations in the past and could affect our results of operations in the future include the following 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance in addition the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 

 

risks related to our products 

 

we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 

 

our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for our target segments our addin board and motherboard manufacturers original design manufacturers or odms and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations this requires that we do the following 

 



 



 



 



 

if odms and oems do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their design systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to allow us to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products 

 

as a result we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future we make these expenditures independent of the level of purchase commitments from our customers if our new products are not adopted by our customers our business results may be adversely affected the success of new product introductions will depend on many factors including the following 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking markets and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and cellular phone manufacturers if these relationships are not successful we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results 

 

in addition our strategy includes utilizing the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by oems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of pcs and consumer electronics even if we are able to provide the demanded features and functionality we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the oems’ design cycles and market demand we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new digital media processors would harm our business in particular during the first half of fiscal 2004 we experienced delays in the introduction of digital media processors using our next generation technology in addition we expected to ramp up sales of our pci express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 but as a result of intel’s delayed pci express chipset production followed by their product recall the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our geforce pcx gpus any such delay in the future or failure of our digital media processors or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 

 

our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 

 

as our digital media processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our digital media processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins in order for our digital media processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our digital media processor for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion in addition we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ odms’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition technologies developed by others may render our digital media processors noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory any of which would harm our business 

 

pci express is central to our gpu as well as mcp strategies and the outcome of this strategy will impact our business 

 

pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking the transition to pci express which is extremely complex is central to our gpu and mcp objectives this fiscal year we initiated this transition by creating our geforce pcx series of gpus using hsi technology during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of gpus ready to support pci express chipsets we expected to ramp up sales of our pci express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 but as a result of intel’s delayed pci express chipset production followed by their product recall the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our geforce pcx gpus during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we announced and ramped up sales of the geforce 6600 gt geforce 6600 and the geforce 6200 our first native pci express gpus in may 2004 we announced the mobile pci express module specification or mxm mxm was jointly developed by nvidia and leading notebook pc manufacturers in an effort to accelerate the adoption of pci expressbased notebooks in all market segments mxm is an open design specification that supports a wide range of graphics solutions from most gpu manufacturers allowing system integrators maximum flexibility for buildtoorder with various graphics solutions mxm also serves as the primary delivery vehicle for our geforce go 6 series of gpus 

industry adoption of pci express was slower than we expected during fiscal 2005 and there is no assurance that the adoption rate will increase during fiscal 2006 if our pci express compatible products do not meet consumer andor customer demand or expectations our business results could suffer 

we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 

 

products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects or incompatibilities in the future errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field we may also be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect which could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development of new products these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results we may also suffer a loss of reputation andor a loss in our market share either of which could materially harm our financial results 

 

risks related to our partners   

 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of these customers 

 

we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems currently we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading pc oems retail outlets and to a large number of system builders if we were to lose sales to our pc oems cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers or if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 

 

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income which could harm our business 

 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry in addition difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations accounts receivable owed by foreign customers may be difficult to collect we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure as of the end of fiscal 2005 fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 01 01 and 02 of revenue for each fiscal quarter respectively if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs in the future which could negatively impact our financial results 

 

we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

 

we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility our products require wafers manufactured with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques we utilize tsmc ibm umc and chartered to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity at ibm we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices these manufacturers may be unable to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing or pricing requirements we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis the foundries we use have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product tsmc ibm umc and chartered fabricate wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product in addition the time and expense to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc ibm umc chartered and any other manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand any difficulties like these would harm our business 

 

we are dependent on third parties located outside of the united states for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our products 

 

our digital media processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd amkor technology inc stats chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering inc all of which are located outside of the united states we do not have longterm agreements with any of these subcontractors as a result of our dependence on thirdparty subcontractors for assembly testing and packaging of our products we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality any product shortages quality assurance problems or political instability outside of the united states could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers 

 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 

 

in the design and development of new products and product enhancements we rely on thirdparty software development tools while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future for example we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from digital media processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that are available to us if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands our business could suffer 

 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products and sell our products 

 

in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business segment if we do consider an acquisition strategic alliance or joint venture the negotiations could divert management’s attention as well as other resources for any previous or future acquisition or investment the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products and may not lead to any improvements in our financial results 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we pay a portion of the purchase price in cash our cash reserves would be reduced if the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of existing stockholders would be further diluted we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 

 

  the impact on our future revenue by microsoft’s announcement that it has entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services is uncertain 

 

during fiscal 2004 microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from microsoft is uncertain but we anticipate that we will not achieve historical levels of xbox revenue in fiscal 2006 revenue from microsoft during fiscal 2005 fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 accounted for 13 15 and 23 respectively of our total revenue if our revenue from microsoft declines during fiscal 2006 we will need to increase revenue from other customers in order to be able to maintain our current revenue level and operating results if we do not replace any reduction in revenue from microsoft with revenue from other customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

 



 



 



 



 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia 

 

risks related to our competition 

 

the 3d graphics platform processor and handheld industries are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 

 

the market for gpus mcps and wmps for pcs and handhelds is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces or apis manufacturing capabilities price of digital media processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products which could harm our business further we expect substantial competition from intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products such as the centrino platform 

 

an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu and mcp solutions for the pc and wmp segments some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors include the following 

 









if and to the extent we offer products outside of the pc consumer electronics and handheld segments we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets our financial results will suffer 

 

our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 

 

our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers our addin board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem and odm customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year generally based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly at the time our oem and odm customers are making their decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics consistent quality correct price and an adequate featureset in order to be included in new system configurations our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature which also could harm our business even if we achieve a significant number of design wins there can be no assurance that our oem and odm customers will actually take the design to production or that the design will be commercially successful 

 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers including intel and microsoft such changes would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time our ability to achieve design wins could suffer if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 

 

 

risks related to market conditions 

 

we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

 

we derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc segments including professional workstations we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc segments in the next several years a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales will reduce demand for our products moreover changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed 

 

if our products do not continue to be accepted by the pc and consumer electronics segments or if demand by the pc and consumer electronics segments for new and innovative products decreases our business and operating results would suffer 

 

our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our digital media processors for 3d graphics in pc and consumer electronics applications the market for digital media processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in dynamic randomaccess memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions since the pc segment is our core business our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future digital media processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc segment if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc segment we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results additionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers and the market do not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and our business and operating results could suffer 

 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

 

a significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by thirdparties located outside of the united states additionally we generated 76 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for the fiscal 2005 revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2004 and 2003 accounted for 75 and 68 of total revenue respectively the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states and sales to these customers outside of the united states and other americas subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states and other americas including but not limited to 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 

 

we also have sales offices in several international locations including taiwan russia japan china hong kong germany france and the united kingdom we have a design center in germany and recently opened a design center in india our international operations are subject to the many of the risks contained in the above list difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing may divert management’s attention and other resources all of which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

currently all of our arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers and subcontractors provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars as are sales to our customers located outside of the united states and other americas increases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which would negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

hostilities involving the united states andor terrorist attacks could harm our business 

the financial political economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states led to a weakening of the global economy subsequent terrorist acts andor the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states and iraq or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers distributors and suppliers which could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results 

 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints variations in manufacturing costs and yields significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry which can be unpredictable and rapid in an efficient and timely manner our operating results could suffer in particular from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand during a downturn our revenue and earnings will suffer during downturns 

 

political instability in taiwan and in the people’s republic of china or elsewhere could harm our business 

 

because of our reliance on tsmc and umc our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan including the worsening of the strained relations between the people’s republic of china and taiwan or if relations between the united states and the people’s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events if any of our suppliers experienced a substantial disruption in their operations as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability acts of terrorism or war equipment failure or other cause could harm our business 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 115 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall part of our portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies the value of which are subject to market price volatility due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because our debt securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 

 

our stock price may continue to experience significant shortterm fluctuations 

 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe for example on august 5 2004 we announced that the operating results for our second quarter of fiscal 2005 included significantly lower amounts of revenue and earnings per share than had been expected by securities analysts our announcement was followed by a decline in the trading price of our common stock conversely on february 17 2005 we announced better than expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 this announcement was followed by an increase in the price of our common stock we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are noncompany specific such as the decline in the united states economy acts of terror against the united states war or due to a variety of company specific factors including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these risk factors 

 

risks related to intellectual property litigation and government action 

 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls   

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2004 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements this legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

expensing employee stock options in future periods will materially and aversely affect our reported operating results 

since inception we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment  or sfas no 123r sfas no 123r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 and requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stockbased compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings to the extent that sfas no 123r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce the noncash expense may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees any of which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 

 

we are currently involved in patent litigation which if not resolved favorably could require us to pay damages 

 

we are currently involved in patent litigation on october 19 2004 opti incorporated or opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five united states patents held by opti opti seeks unspecified damages for our conduct attorneys fees and triple damages because of our alleged willful infringement of these patents discovery has not begun and no trial date has been set we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 

in august 2004 a texas limited partnership named american video graphics lp or avg filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants not including nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas avg initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that avg claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality each of the three lawsuits targeted a different group of defendants one case involves approximately twenty of the leading personal computer manufacturers the pc makers case one case involves the three leading video game console makers the game console case and one case involves approximately ten of the leading video game publishers the game publishers case in november 2004 nvidia sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending avg lawsuits the pc makers case and the game console case nvidia’s complaint in intervention alleges both that the patents in suit are invalid and that to the extent avg’s claims target nvidia products the asserted patents are not infringed two other leading suppliers of graphics processing products intel and ati have also intervened in the cases ati in both the pc makers and game console case and intel in the pc makers case 

after some consensual reconfigurations proposed by the various parties in january 2005 the district court judge entered docket control and discovery orders in the three lawsuits the pc makers case now involves four separate patents and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on september 11 2006 the game console case involves a single patent and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on december 4 2006 we believe that to the extent avg’s infringement allegations target functionality that may be performed by nvidia products those claims are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves and our products vigorously 

 

our defenses against these suits may be unsuccessful at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the range of any loss or damages resulting from these suits due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome if these cases go forward we expect that they will result additional legal and other costs regardless of the outcome which could be substantial 

 

our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in litigation and substantial costs to us 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation the digital media processor industry in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions the technology that we use to design and develop our products and that is incorporated into our products may be subject to claims that it infringes the patents or intellectual property rights of others our success is dependent on our ability to develop new products without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition in our product lines intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase if infringement claims are made against us we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights however licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly by competitors the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products which could reduce our revenue and harm our business furthermore we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights which could be costly 

 

if we have to initiate a claim our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results in order to develop products we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements with third parties for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms or at all our competitive position and our business could suffer 

 

we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products we may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or customers that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to these customers in addition litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to 

 



 



 



 



 

regardless of the outcome litigation can be very costly and can divert management’s attention from other matters we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or group of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief if one of our patents in invalidated or found to be unenforceable we would be unable to license the patent which could result in a loss of revenue we or our customers may be required to obtain a license to the other parties’ patents or intellectual property if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology we use or that is used by an indemnified customer we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture of and sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our business initiation of claims or indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products including our digital media processors we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as by the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions the location in which our products are manufactured our strategic technology or product directions in different countries and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 

 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies these investments are denominated in united states dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

as of january 30 2005 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 29 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future

sales and marketing 

our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus mcps and umps for pcs and handheld devices our sales and marketing teams work closely with oems odms system integrators motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and industry trendsetters collectively our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

in the segments we serve the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system integrators and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by addin board and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and stocking representatives each of which has relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors directly to stocking representatives cems odms motherboard manufacturers and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world 



 

our gpus are currently designed into products offered by virtually every leading branded pc oem including acer apple dell emachines fujitsusiemens gateway hp ibm micron nec sgi and sony as well as leading cems including celestica hong kong ltd mitac international corporation microstar international co ltd or microstar and sanmina sci corporation and leading motherboard and addin board manufacturers including abit computer corporation asustek computer inc canopus corporation gainward co ltd gigabyte technology co ltd guillemot corporation leadtek research inc and pny technologies 

as a result of our channel strategy our sales are focused on a small number of customers sales to edom technology co ltd or edom accounted for 21 sales to microsoft accounted for 15 sales to atlantic semiconductor or atlantic accounted for 12 and sales to microstar accounted for 12 of our total revenue for fiscal 2004 edom and atlantic are independent stocking representatives microstar is a cem and each of these companies purchases our products and resells these products to oems and system integrators 

to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes products available to developers prior to volume availability to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 

backlog 

we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonality 

our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market due to the seasonality in this market we typically expect to see stronger revenue growth in the second half of the calendar year related to the backtoschool and holiday seasons 

manufacturing 

we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy leverages the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization or iso in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support 

we utilize taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc ibm and united microelectronics corporation or umc to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging of our products historically our gpus and mcps were primarily fabricated by tsmc however on march 26 2003 we announced that we had formed a multiyear strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture some of our gpus in july 2003 we began production of the geforce fx 5700 gpu at ibm’s plant in new york in august 2003 we completed the acquisition of mediaq inc a leading provider of graphics and multimedia technology for handheld devices mediaq’s products now branded as our goforce products are manufactured at umc 

our gpus mcps and umps are assembled tested and packaged by advanced semiconductor engineering amkor technology chippac incorporated and siliconware precision industries company ltd we receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to cems stocking representatives motherboard and addin board manufacturer customers from our santa clara california warehouse and thirdparty warehouses in singapore and hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications then ship the products to retailers system integrators or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions our hardware and software development teams work closely with certification agencies microsoft windows hardware quality labs and our oem customers to ensure that both our boards and software drivers are certified for inclusion in the oems’ products 



 

inventory and working capital 

  our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on this forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability we maintain substantial inventories of our products because t he semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 

research and development 

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics high definition video audio ultralow power communications and networking performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus mcps and umps using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration or vlsi design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc ikos systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc manufacturers 

we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1057 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 25 2004 compared to 832 employees as of january 26 2003 during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 we incurred research and development expenditures of 2700 million 2249 million and 1548 million respectively 

competition 

the market for gpus mcps and umps for pcs and handhelds is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of digital media processors and total system costs of addin boards or motherboards we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products 

our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu mcp and ump solutions for the pc and handheld segments our competitors include the following

microsoft xbox 

on august 14 2003 microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain but we do not believe that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least 18 – 24 months revenue from microsoft during fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 accounted for 15 23 and 9 respectively of our total revenue 



 

future objectives and challenges 

peripheral component interconnect express or pciexpress 

pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking the transition to pci express which is extremely complex is central to our gpu and mcp objectives this year we intend to lead this transition using a pci express highspeed interconnect or hsi hsi is a complex piece of networking technology that performs highspeed bidirectional interconnect protocol conversion using hsi we expect to transform some of our gpus into pci express compatible gpus with our pci express compatible gpus we expect that our partners will be able to launch pci express compatible solutions in april 2004 during fiscal 2005 we expect to launch and be in full production with a toptobottom product line of next generation pci express gpus based on our brand new nv4x architecture 

gross margin improvement 

we remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins with the scale of our business we believe driving gross margins to our historical levels can result in earnings improvements 

nforce3 

just as nforce2 was the driver for our platform processor business growth in fiscal 2004 nforce3 has the potential to achieve similar results for fiscal 2005 our mcp objective is to innovate in all areas of features performance and compatibility during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we intend to launch our next nforce3 which is expected to be the first singlechip mcp to offer gigabit ethernet dual independent serial advanced technology attachment or ata controllers industry leading redundant array of independent disks or raid features and hardware security processing 

handsets 

our handheld objective is to drive the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products that leverage nvidia’s expertise resources and investments in digital media processing the first quarter of fiscal 2005 will mark the beginning of a series of introductions of exciting new ultralow power media processors for handsets over the next several years digital media processing technologies are expected to play a critical role in the cell phone industry cell phones that take digital pictures will eclipse shipments of digital cameras with the umps on our roadmap future cell phones will be able to receive television programs record digital video like a camcorder enable video phone calls and be your portable game player 

11 micron process 

on february 24 2004 we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select upcoming gpus at tsmcs 011 um micron process technology we will combine tsmcs 011 micron process with our own engineering designs to deliver highperformance and lowpower consumption in a graphics processor tsmcs 011 micron process technology is fundamentally a photolithographic shrink of its industryleading 013 micron process though actual results are designdependent tsmcs 011 micron highperformance process also includes transistor enhancements that improve speed and reduce power consumption relative to its 013 micron technology 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable inventories longlived assets goodwill income taxes stockbased compensation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

 



 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for all sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash 

our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the product 

we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 019 or eitf 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products and as such we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor unclaimed rebates which historically have not been significant are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale 

our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs which we also account for in accordance with eitf 019 mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting nvidia products 

if market conditions decline we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 

we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

accounts receivable 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future our current credit insurance agreement expires on december 31 2004 

as of january 25 2004 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 23 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 2195 million of the 2195 million 397 million was covered by credit insurance and 30 million was covered by letters of credit as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 1 and 2 as of january 25 2004 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 1 of our gross accounts receivable balance if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at 2 of our gross accounts receivable balance then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january 25 2004 would have been approximately 44 million rather than the actual balance of 23 million 



 

inventories 

we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold no significant sales of such products have occurred to date 

valuation of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we utilize a twostep approach to testing longlived assets for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment indicators if an impairment indicator is present the second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset our review requires the use of judgment and estimates no such impairment charges have occurred to date however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable 

 

goodwill 

 

we utilize a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test the second step if necessary measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment however future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 

income taxes 

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states or us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 



 

as of january 25 2004 we had a valuation allowance of 1827 million of the total valuation allowance 1170 million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if and when realization is sustained will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity of the remaining valuation allowance at january 25 2004 214 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not more likely than not to be realized due in part to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes and 443 million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not more likely than not to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero then reduce other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 

 



 

fiscal years ended january 25 2004 january 26 2003 and january 27 2002 

revenue 

revenue was 182 billion in fiscal 2004 191 billion in fiscal 2003 and 137 billion in fiscal 2002 which represented a decrease of 5 from fiscal 2003 to 2004 and an increase of 39 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 the revenue decrease from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of xbox processors to microsoft offset by growth in our gpu mcp and ump products the revenue growth from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of significant sales of xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our gpu and mcp products 

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 75 68 and 82 of total revenue for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product which are billed to microsoft in the united states the decrease in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to increased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product 

sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 15 of revenues for fiscal 2004 our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 45 of revenues for fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 23 of revenues our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 41 of revenues for fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2002 sales to microsoft accounted for approximately 9 of revenues our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 44 of revenues for fiscal 2002 

in future periods our revenue may be affected by demand for and market acceptance of our products andor our customers’ products our ability to successfully develop and produce our products in volume production competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

gross profit 

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold 

our gross margin was 29 30 and 38 in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our new generation of geforce fx products our geforce fx products generally have experienced lower gross margins than previous geforce products this decrease was offset by an increase in gross margins on sales of xbox processors in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 which resulted from the pricing settlement with microsoft that we announced on february 6 2003 gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to a shift in mix of product sales that included more sales of xbox processors which at that time generally had lower margins than our other products in addition the decrease was due to an inventory writedown of approximately 210 million related to certain xbox processors and nforce platform processors during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 and the stock option exchange expense of 62 million that was charged to cost of revenue related to manufacturing personnel during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 

in the future we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand a reduction in demand and market acceptance of our products andor our customers’ products could also negatively impact our gross margins we do not expect past results to be indicative of future periods we remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins we expect improvement in our gross margins and believe our gross margins can be 30 or more 

operating expenses 

research and development  research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits cost of development tools and software cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs research and development expenses increased by 451 million or 20 from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 332 million increase related to additional personnel including approximately 60 employees that we obtained as a result of our acquisition of mediaq a 212 million increase associated with lab equipment software licenses maintenance fees and increased depreciation and amortization charges and a 20 million increase in facility expenses offset by a 113 million decrease in new product development costs and other expenses during the period research and development expenses increased by 701 million or 45 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a 329 million increase related to additional personnel a 222 million increase associated with lab equipment software licenses maintenance fees and depreciation charges a 45 million increase related to engineering costs to develop next generation products and a 105 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year 



 

we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues 

sales general and administrative  sales general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions and bonuses promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses sales general and administrative expenses increased 138 million or 9 from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 129 million increase related to additional personnel a 91 million increase in tradeshow marketing development and general administrative activities and a 32 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equipment these increases were offset by an 114 million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that have since been resolved including the sec inquiry microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits sales general and administrative expenses increased 525 million or 53 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a 164 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions a 166 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings a 90 million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems a 79 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs and a 26 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses 

we expect sales general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations expand our sales launch our new products and protect our business interests 

inprocess research and development in connection with our acquisition of mediaq in august 2003 we wroteoff 35 million of inprocess research and development expense or iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin 4 applicability of sfas no 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of sfas no 2  amounts assigned to iprd meeting the abovestated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 

stock option exchange on september 26 2002 we commenced an offer or the offer to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than 2700 per share or eligible options stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20615000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the offer representing approximately 39 of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date only employees of nvidia or one of our subsidiaries as of september 26 2002 who continued to be employees through the offer termination date of october 24 2002 were eligible to participate in the offer employees who were on medical maternity worker’s compensation military or other statutorily protected leave of absence or a personal leave of absence were also eligible to participate in the offer employees who were terminated on or before the offer termination date of october 24 2002 were not eligible to participate in the offer in addition our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in this offer 

on october 24 2002 the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18843000 eligible options for total consideration of 618 million consisting of 399 million in fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock approximately 3815000 shares and 219 million in employer and employee related taxes the number of fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of our common stock on october 24 2002 of 1046 per share 



 

amortization of goodwill during fiscal 2002 amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx the initial allocation of the purchase price included 574 million of goodwill plus approximately 30 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 we have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment 

acquisition related charges acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002 these charges primarily consisted of bonuses to former 3dfx employees 

discontinued use of property discontinued use of property consists of writeoffs of 37 million relating to our previous office space in santa clara california since we relocated in june 2001 we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley the writeoffs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease including rental payments capitalized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in december 2001 we filed a complaint against extreme networks inc the sublessor of the property seeking payment of lease payments and other property charges for the period of july 2001 through december 2001 and seeking a declaration that we are not liable for any future payments under the lease in july 2003 we settled the matter with extreme networks and in august 2003 the complaint was dismissed with prejudice 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income decreased from 232 million to 186 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower average balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 this was caused by the redemption of our 3000 million convertible subordinated debentures in october 2003 interest income decreased from 277 million to 232 million from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in market interest rates 

interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and prior to the redemption in october 2003 interest on our convertible subordinated debentures interest expense decreased from 165 million to 120 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures 

other income expense net 

other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and any gains or losses related to the disposal of fixed assets other income increased by 32 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to 25 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem our convertible subordinated debentures in october 2003 

convertible debenture redemption expense 

on october 24 2003 we fully redeemed our 3000 million of 4¾ convertible subordinated debentures due 2007 or the notes the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding was 3000 million which included 186 million of notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended october 26 2003 the redemption price was equal to approximately 1027 of the outstanding principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the redemption date in connection with the redemption of the notes we recorded a onetime charge of approximately 131 million which included a 76 million redemption premium and 55 million of unamortized issuance costs 



 

income taxes 

we recognized income tax expense of 123 million 598 million and 758 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 141 in fiscal 2004 397 in fiscal 2003 and 300 in fiscal 2002 

significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 included the 35 million mediaq iprd writeoff for which no tax benefit was recognized the 750 million income tax benefit of certain tax contingencies as a result of settlement of our irs exam the 382 million income tax expense for the accrual of us deferred income taxes on previous permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the 336 million income tax expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not to be realized due in part to projections of future sources of taxable income 

please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the components of income tax expense 

the increase in our annual effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to our not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense for that quarter was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available 

we expect our annual effective income tax rate to be 20 for fiscal 2005 please refer to part ii item 7 critical accounting policies  income taxes for items that may affect this estimate 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of january 25 2004 we had 6040 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities a decrease of 4244 million from the end of fiscal 2003 the decrease was primarily due to the 3000 million redemption of the notes in october 2003 and the 713 million acquisition of mediaq in august 2003 our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions our investment policy requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration 

operating activities generated cash of 497 million 2650 million and 1608 million during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in income taxes payable due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies 

cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment which include leasehold improvements for our facilities investing activities provided cash of 880 million and used cash of 2773 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 2869 million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities as we liquidated a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the 3000 million notes in october 2003 this increase in cash from sales and maturities of marketable securities was offset by 1276 million in capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development emulation equipment technology licenses and software and 713 million for the acquisition of mediaq we expect to spend approximately 800 million to 1000 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 primarily for software licenses emulation equipment computer and engineering workstations in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 

financing activities used cash of 2703 million during fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided of 263 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in cash used in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the 3000 million redemption of the notes which included 186 million of notes that we had purchased during the three months ended october 26 2003 



 

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

·     decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers’ products 

·     inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products 

·     competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and 

·     new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

for additional factors see business risks – our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

other key factors that could affect our liquidity include 

shelf registration statement 

in december 2003 we filed a form s3 with the securities and exchange commission or sec under their shelf registration process this shelf registration was declared effective by the sec on march 25 2004  under this shelf registration process we may sell common stock preferred stock debt securities warrants stock purchase contracts andor stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of 5000 million unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes in particular we expect to incur significant operating expenses in connection with 

·     continuing to develop our technology 

·     hiring additional personnel 

·     expanding our sales and marketing organization and activities 

·     acquiring complementary technologies or businesses and 

·     capital expenditures 

3dfx asset purchase 

the 3dfx asset purchase closed on april 18 2001 under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provided subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx could not make such a certification but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for or could not be satisfied for less than 250 million we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets we are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfx’s subsequent bankruptcy in october 2002 please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this litigation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the us government and its agencies these investments are denominated in us dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 or sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because our debt securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax as of january 25 2004 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 27 million 

exchange rate risk 

 

we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

business risks 

in addition to the risks discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is subject to the risks set forth below 



 

risks related to our operations 

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete 

effectively 

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we currently use 015micron 014 micron and 013 micron process technologies for our family of gpus mcps and umps the majority of our newest gpus the geforce fx and the geforce fx go products are manufactured in 013micron process technology 

we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position on february 24 2004 we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select upcoming gpus at tsmcs 011 um micron process technology 

we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels moreover we are dependent on our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully we may continue to have difficulty migrating to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis our inability to transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and harm our gross margins 

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing andor new products would reduce our gross margins 

semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 

because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall our business could suffer 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees marv burkett and david shannon are our only officers or employees bound by an employment agreement and so our relationships with our other officers and employees are at will we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our executive officers technical personnel or other key employees particularly jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer would harm our business our success will depend on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 

our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our gross margins 

inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to writedown our inventory and our gross margins could be adversely affected 



 

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline  

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline perhaps substantially we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

factors that have affected our results of operations in the past and could affect our results of operations in the future include the following 

·     demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers’ products 

·     the successful development and volume production of nextgeneration products 

·     new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 

·     our ability to introduce new products in accordance with original equipment manufacturers’ or oems’ design requirements and design cycles 

·     changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products 

·     fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields 

·     declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the us and international economies 

·     competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices 

·     product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues 

·     the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 

·     the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship 

·     seasonal fluctuations associated with the pc market 

·     substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations either as a result of a natural disaster equipment failure terrorism or other cause 

·     supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products including memory devices 

·     our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products 

·     legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits 

·     customer receivable bad debt writeoffs 

·     costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products 

·     unexpected inventory writedowns and 

·     introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers 

 

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance in addition the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 



 

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand therefore we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than longterm agreements as a result we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 

to stay competitive we may have to invest more resources in research and development 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts our business could suffer we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1057 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 25 2004 compared to 832 employees as of january 26 2003 during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 research and development expenditures represented 15 12 and 11 as a percentage of revenue respectively 

risks related to our products 

pci express is central to our gpu as well as mcp strategies this year and the outcome of this strategy will impact our business 

pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking the transition to pci express which is extremely complex is central to our gpu and mcp strategies this year we intend to lead this transition using a pci express highspeed interconnect or hsi hsi is a complex piece of networking technology that performs highspeed bidirectional interconnect protocol conversion using hsi we expect to transform some of our gpus into pci express compatible gpus with our pci express compatible gpus we expect that our partners will be able to launch pci express compatible solutions in april 2004 during fiscal 2005 we expect to launch and be in full production with a toptobottom product line of next generation pci express gpus based on our brand new nv4x architecture if we fail to deliver pci express in a timely manner or if our pci express compatible products do not meet consumer andor analysts expectations our business could suffer 

we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 

our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for our target segments our addin board and motherboard manufacturers original design manufacturers or odms and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations this requires that we do the following 

·   anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand 

·   incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of oems odms cems and addin board and motherboard   manufacturers 

·   price our products competitively and 

·   introduce the products to the market within the limited window for oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers 

 



 

as a result we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future the success of new product introductions will depend on several factors including the following 

·   proper new product definition 

·   timely completion and introduction of new product designs 

·   the ability of international business machines or ibm taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc united microelectronics corporation or umc and   any additional thirdparty manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner 

·   the quality of any new products 

·   differentiation of new products from those of our competitors 

·   market acceptance of our products and our customers products and 

·   availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products 

 

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design or cad industry we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc ikos systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc manufacturers if these relationships are not successful we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner 

in addition our strategy includes utilizing the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by oems odms addin board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of personal computers and consumer electronics in addition we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the oems’ design cycles and market demand we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new digital media processors would harm our business in particular we experienced delays in the introduction of digital media processors using our next generation technology during the first half of fiscal 2004 and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 

our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 

as our digital media processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our digital media processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins in order for our digital media processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our digital media processor for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion new products in addition we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ odms’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition technologies developed by others may render our digital media processors noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory any of which would harm our business 



 

we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 

products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 

risks related to our partners 

we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of these customers 

we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems odms motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers and stocking representatives each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems currently we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors directly to stocking representatives cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading pc oems retail outlets and to a large number of system builders as a result our business could be harmed by the loss of business from pc oems cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers in addition revenue from pc oems cems odms motherboard and addin board manufacturers that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods individually or as a group may not continue or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income which could harm our business 

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure as of the of fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 01 02 and 02 of revenue for each fiscal year respectively if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs in the future which could harm our business 

we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility our products require wafers manufactured with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques we utilize tsmc ibm and umc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity at tsmc we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis these manufacturers may be unable to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis tsmc has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product tsmc ibm and umc fabricate wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc ibm umc and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand any difficulties like these would harm our business 



 

there can be no assurance that ibm will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis  

on march 26 2003 we announced that we have formed a multiyear strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our nextgeneration geforce gpus as part of the agreement we will gain access to ibm’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies including powerefficient copper wiring and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm nanometer a billionth of a meter in the next several years giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus ibm began manufacturing the nextgeneration geforce graphics processor in july 2003 at ibm’s plant in east fishkill new york 

during the development of our relationship with ibm our manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of ibm any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall our business could suffer 

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products 

our digital media processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd amkor technology chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering we do not have longterm agreements with any of these subcontractors as a result of our dependence on thirdparty subcontractors for assembly testing and packaging of our products we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business 

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products  

in the design and development of new products and product enhancements we rely on thirdparty software development tools while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future for example we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from digital media processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands our business could suffer 

microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain 

on august 14 2003 microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain but we do not anticipate that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least 18 – 24 months revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft during fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 accounted for 9 23 and 15 respectively of our total revenue 



 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products 

in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels for any previous or future acquisition or investment the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products 

·     difficulty in combining the technology operations or workforce of the acquired business 

·     disruption of our ongoing businesses 

·     difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction 

·     difficulty in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies and 

·     possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock if the consideration is paid with our common stock existing stockholders would be further diluted 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

·     the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval 

·     the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent 

·     a classified board of directors and 

·     advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia 

risks related to our competition 

the 3d graphics platform processor and handheld industries are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 

the market for gpus mcps and umps for pcs and handhelds in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of digital media processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products which could harm our business 



 

our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu and mcp solutions for the pc and handheld segments our competitors include the following 

 

·   suppliers of mcps that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as ati intel silicon integrated systems and via 

·   suppliers of desktop standalone gpus that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as ati creative technology matrox electronics systems ltd and xgi technology inc 

·   suppliers of notebook standalone gpus that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as ati silicon motion and the joint venture of a division of sonicblue incorporated formerly s3 incorporated and via and 

·   suppliers of umps for handheld devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as ati and seikoepson 

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the personal computer consumer electronics and handheld segments we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 

our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 

our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems odms and addin board and motherboard manufacturers our addin board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem and odm customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year generally based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature which also could harm our business 

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers including intel and microsoft this would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 

risks related to market conditions 

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

our reliance on foreign thirdparty manufacturing assembly testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states including the following 

·     unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements 

·     delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions 

·     longer payment cycles 

·     imposition of additional taxes and penalties 

·     the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and 

·     other factors beyond our control including terrorism and war which may delay the shipment of our products 

 



 

we also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 

 

currently all of our arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business 

our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints variations in manufacturing costs and yields significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry which can be unpredictable and rapid in an efficient and timely manner our operating results could suffer in particular from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand our revenues and earnings will suffer during downturns 

our products may not continue to be accepted by the pc and consumer electronics segments 

our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our digital media processors for 3d graphics in pc and consumer electronics applications the market for digital media processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition since the pc segment is our core business our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future digital media processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc segment if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc segment our business would be harmed 

we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

during fiscal 2004 we derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop and notebook pc segments including professional workstations  we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop and notebook pc segments in the next several years a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales will reduce demand for our products moreover changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed 



 

hostilities involving the united states andor terrorist attacks could harm our business 

the financial political economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states led to a weakening of the global economy subsequent terrorist acts andor the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers distributors and suppliers which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

political instability in taiwan and in the people’s republic of china could harm our business 

because of our reliance on tsmc and umc our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan including the worsening of the strained relations between the people’s republic of china and taiwan or if relations between the us and the people’s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events furthermore any substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations either as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability acts of terrorism or war equipment failure or other cause could harm our business 

our stock price may continue to experience significant shortterm fluctuations 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are noncompany specific such as the decline in the us economy acts of terror against the us war or due to a variety of company specific factors including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s stock securities class action litigation had been initiated against the issuing company 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the us government and its agencies these investments are denominated in us dollars 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 115 all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because our debt securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 

risks related to intellectual property litigation and government action 

our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation the digital media processor industry in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions in addition from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition in our product lines intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase if infringement claims are made against us we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights however licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly by competitors the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products which could reduce our revenues and harm our business furthermore we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products 



 

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products including our digital media processors we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions the location in which our products are manufactured our strategic technology or product directions in different countries and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 

our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

we are currently subject to claims of patent infringement and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other parties in the future these claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages 

future actions by the irs or sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies could harm our business 

 

as of january 25 2004 the internal revenue service or irs closed our federal income tax return exam for our fiscal years ended january 28 2001 and january 27 2002 the results of our exam were submitted to the joint committee on taxation or the joint committee for review 

with our exam closed we recorded the tax benefit of the settlement in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended january 25 2004 because we had certainty as to the outcome of certain tax contingencies for which we had established liabilities however the failure of the joint committee to agree with our settlement may result in a material adverse impact on the results of our operations in the period in which the matter is either resolved or in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable please refer to part ii item 7 results of operations  income taxes and note 14 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

we are subject to changes in financial accounting standards which may affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business 

the financial accounting standards board and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap that may require us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options we currently us the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to our employees under this method we generally do no recognize compensation expense for an employee stock option when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant if any change to us gaap is adopted that requires us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options our reported results of operations may be adversely affected

we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3d graphics performance and features is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of graphics processors using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration or vlsi design engineering process engineering and architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 

  

a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the cad industry we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders including cadence design systems inc ikos systems inc and synopsys inc often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc manufacturers 

  

  

we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 832 fulltime employees engaged in research and development as of january 26 2003 compared to 619 employees as of january 27 2002 during fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 we incurred research and development expenditures of 2249 million 1548 million and 860 million respectively 

  

competition 

  

the market for 3d graphics processors for pcs is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of graphics processors and total system costs of addin boards or motherboards we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3d graphics processors or that may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products 

  

our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide 3d graphics solutions for the pc market our competitors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3d graphics processor market we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 

  

patents and proprietary rights 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property as of january 26 2003 we owned 91 issued united states patents 16 issued foreign patents and have 203 united states patent applications pending and 19 foreign patent applications pending our issued patents have expiration dates from september 4 2007 to october 16 2020 as of january 26 2003 our patents and pending patent applications related to technology used by us in connection with our products including our graphics processors our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

  

  

employees 

  

as of january 26 2003 we had 1513 employees 832 of whom were engaged in research and development and 681 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and administrative positions none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationships with our employees are good

the staff of the enforcement division of the securities  exchange commission “sec” informed us in january 2002 that it had concerns relating to certain accounting matters and that the sec along with the us attorney’s office for the northern district of california had authorized investigations into such matters in accordance with the suggestion and advice of the sec staff we launched a review of these matters on april 29 2002 we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had with assistance from the law firm of cooley godward llp and forensic auditors from the accounting firm of kpmg llp concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate our financial statements for fiscal 2000 2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 the audit committee has worked and continues to work in cooperation with the sec after receiving a wells notice indicating the sec staff intended to recommend to the sec that an enforcement action be initiated we reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff in april 2003 that would resolve the sec’s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement the agreement is subject to final approval of the sec under the terms of the agreement in principle nvidia without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing would agree to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain nonfraud financial reporting books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws we would not be required to pay any fines or penalties the documentation of the agreement and the sec’s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete further there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the sec notwithstanding the above actions by the sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies with respect to us or our personnel arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters may take significant time may be expensive and may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 

  

on april 18 2001 we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx including patents and patent applications under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provides subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx certifies to our satisfaction all its debts and other liabilities have been provided for then we are obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx cannot make such a certification but instead certifies to our satisfaction that its debts and liabilities can be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx can elect to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx cannot certify that all of its debts and liabilities have been provided for or can be satisfied for less than 250 million we are not obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets on october 15 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection we believe that the bankruptcy filing by 3dfx will allow a determination of the full number and scope of 3dfx’s debts and liabilities nvidia may be obligated under the asset purchase agreement to pay 3dfx the contingent consideration following this determination subject to offsets for nvidia’s claims against 3dfx arising from the asset purchase agreement on march 12 2003 we were served with a complaint by the trustee for 3dfx seeking among other things additional payment for the purchased assets and the assumption by us of 3dfx’s liabilities in addition carlyle fortran trust and carramerica former landlords of 3dfx have filed suits against us seeking payment of the rents due by 3dfx 

  

we were engaged with microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the xbox chipset these discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on april 23 2002 microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration on february 6 2003 nvidia and microsoft announced that the companies had settled all issues related to pricing of the microsoft xbox gpu and mcp chipset and have ended the arbitration between them in addition to resolving this pricing dispute we have agreed to collaborate with microsoft on future cost reductions for the xbox 

  

we are subject to other legal proceedings but we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period

recent developments 

  

microsoft pricing settlement 

  

we were engaged with microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the xbox chipset these discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on april 23 2002 microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration on february 6 2003 nvidia and microsoft announced that the companies had settled all issues related to pricing of the microsoft xbox gpu and mcp chipset and have ended the arbitration between them in addition to resolving this pricing dispute we have agreed to collaborate with microsoft on future cost reductions for the xbox as a result of the settlement we recognized 404 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2003 

  

strategic alliance with ibm 

  

on march 26 2003 we announced that we have formed a multiyear strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our nextgeneration geforce gpus as part of the agreement we will gain access to ibm’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies including powerefficient copper wiring and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm nanometer a billionth of a meter in the next several years giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus ibm plans to begin manufacturing the nextgeneration geforce graphics processor this summer at ibm’s plant in east fishkill new york 

  

beyond the chip manufacturing technology ibm also offers an automated management system that not only controls production on the factory floor but provides a connection for customer and supplier systems and processes allowing closer integration across the supply chain ibm’s automated management system provides us with opportunities ranging from improved operation to greater efficiency and competitive advantage while using ebusiness techniques to adapt to realtime ondemand influences from the marketplace 

  

securities  exchange commission 

  

in april 2003 subsequent to receiving a wells notice indicating the sec staff intended to recommend to the sec that an enforcement action be initiated we reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff that would resolve the sec’s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement the agreement is subject to final approval of the sec under the terms of the agreement in principle nvidia without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing would agree to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations 

  

of certain nonfraud financial reporting books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws we would not be required to pay any fines or penalties the documentation of the agreement and the sec’s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete further there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the sec 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer programs revenue recognition sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes financing operations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this mda 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the product we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized if market conditions decline we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered we also record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on historical return rates 

  

for all sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and for estimated losses resulting from the financial inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 

  

as of january 26 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts was 42 million and our gross trade receivable balance was 1751 million of the 1751 million 424 million was covered by credit insurance and 42 million was covered by letters of credit as a percentage of our gross trade receivables our allowance for 

  

doubtful accounts has ranged between 1 and 2 as of january 26 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 2 of our gross trade receivables if our allowance for doubtful accounts would have been recorded at 1 or 3 of gross trade receivables then our balance at january 26 2003 would have been approximately 18 million or 53 million respectively rather than the actual balance of 42 million 

  

inventories 

  

we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results if actual market conditions are more favorable we may have higher gross margins when products are sold no significant sales of such products have occurred to date 

  

income taxes 

  

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 

  

we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

for the fiscal year ended january 26 2003 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 544 million that we believe will be recovered however should there be a change in our ability to recover any or part of the deferred tax asset of 544 million our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable as of january 26 2003 we recorded a valuation allowance of 1067 the valuation allowance is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards when realized will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders’ equity 

  

restatement 

  

on april 29 2002 the company announced that it would be restating its previously reported results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 and for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 this restatement was the result of an extensive review directed by the company’s independent audit committee with assistance from the law firm of cooley godward llp and forensic accountants from kpmg llp the company’s audit committee initiated its review at the request of and in full cooperation with the staff of the securities  exchange commission sec the company’s audit committee and its team conducted a thorough review of the company’s records with respect to all issues raised by the sec staff for the periods mentioned the company’s audit committee worked in close cooperation with the sec to provide it with extensive information and conclusions of the review 

  

as discussed in the form 8k filed by nvidia on may 1 2002 the adjustments that were reflected in our restated financial statements fell generally into four categories 

  

   

   

  

   

   

for additional information on the restatement refer to note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 

  

   

fiscal years ended january 26 2003 january 27 2002 and january 28 2001 

  

revenue 

  

revenue was 191 billion in fiscal 2003 137 billion in fiscal 2002 and 7353 million in fiscal 2001 which represented an increase of 39 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and 86 from fiscal 2001 to 2002 the growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by significant shipments of xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our products in the workstation mobile and platform processor product lines 

  

revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and north america accounted for 68 and 82 of total revenue for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers located in the united states the decrease in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is primarily attributable to increased sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the microsoft xbox product billed to microsoft in the united states 

  

  

although we achieved substantial growth in revenue from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and fiscal 2001 to 2002 we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods in addition we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products the declines in average selling prices of 3d graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases 

  

gross profit 

  

gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue our gross margins were 30 38 and 37 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to the shift in mix of business and an inventory writedown during fiscal 2003 sales of xbox processors which generally have lower margins than our other products comprised 23 of our overall revenue as compared to 9 in fiscal 2002 see note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further description of our relationship with microsoft in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we wrote down inventory of approximately 21 million related to certain xbox processors and nforce chipsets gross margin increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin geforce graphics processors partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin xbox graphics and media communication processors 

  

in the future we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit during fiscal 2003 from the same period a year ago we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development  research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits cost of development tools and software cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs research and development expenses increased by 701 million or 45 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a 329 million increase related to additional personnel a 222 million increase associated with lab equipment software licenses maintenance fees and depreciation charges a 45 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products and a 105 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year research and development expenses increased by 687 million or 80 from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a 319 million increase related to additional personnel including certain employees hired from 3dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below a 143 million increase associated with lab equipment software licenses maintenance fees and depreciation charges a 117 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products and a 108 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other expenses during the year 

  

we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues 

  

sales general and administrative  sales general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions and bonuses promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses sales general and administrative expenses increased 525 million or 53 from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a 164 million increase related to additional personnel and 

  

commissions a 166 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings a 90 million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems a 79 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs and a 26 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses sales general and administrative expenses increased 402 million or 69 from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a 215 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions a 62 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs and a 125 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities an american red cross donation associated with the events of september 11 2001 and travel and entertainment expenses 

  

we expect sales general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations expand our sales and protect our business interests

eligible employees who participated in the offer received in exchange for the cancellation of eligible options a fixed amount of consideration represented by fully vested nonforfeitable common stock and applicable withholding taxes equal to the number of shares underlying such eligible options multiplied by 320 less the amount of applicable tax withholdings divided by 1046 the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on october 24 2002 we concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented “substantial consideration” as required by issue 39f of eitf issue no 0023 “issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 25 and fasb interpretation no 44” as the 320 per eligible option was at least the fair value for each eligible option as determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the blackscholes optionpricing model we used the following assumptions i the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options which was approximately 78 years ii a volatility of 500 during the expected life iii a riskfree interest rate of 371 and iv no dividends the amount of 320 per eligible option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period 

  

variable accounting is not required under issue 39a of eitf issue no 0023 for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation because i the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and nonforfeitable and ii the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by 320 divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange we further concluded that the “look back” and “look forward” provisions of fasb interpretation no 44 paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation based on the terms of the offer variable accounting is not required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the offer we do not intend to grant stock options to any participants in the offer for at least six months following october 24 2002 if any stock options are granted to 

  

participants in the offer within the six months following october 24 2002 those stock options will receive variable accounting 

  

on october 24 2002 the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18843000 eligible options for total consideration of 61832000 consisting of 39906000 in fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock approximately 3815000 shares and 21926000 in employer and employee related taxes the number of fully vested nonforfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of our common stock on october 24 2002 of 1046 per share 

  

the shares of our common stock issued in exchange for eligible options were fully vested however a portion of the shares equal to 25 of the total consideration based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer termination date have a six month holding period and a portion of the shares equal to 25 of such total consideration have a one year holding period withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50 of the total consideration and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction 

  

amortization of goodwill 

  

during fiscal 2002 amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx the initial allocation of the purchase price included 574 million of goodwill plus approximately 30 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 

  

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 we have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we have completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and concluded that there was no impairment 

  

acquisition related charges 

  

acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002 these charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former 3dfx employees 

  

discontinued use of property 

  

discontinued use of property consists of writeoffs of 37 million relating to our previous office space in santa clara california since we relocated in june 2001 we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley the writeoffs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease including rental payments capitalized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 

  

interest and other income net 

  

interest and other income net decreased to 66 million in fiscal 2003 from 110 million in fiscal 2002 and 167 million in fiscal 2001 interest income which primarily consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased 45 million from fiscal 2002 to 2003 due to the decline in market interest rates interest income increased 64 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to higher average cash balances as a result of a 2000 million advance received from microsoft in connection with our agreement with microsoft and the receipt of 3875 million from our 4¾ convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings which both closed in october 2000 

  

interest expense which primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt was flat from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 interest expense increased in fiscal 2002 

  

compared to fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of 3000 million of 4¾ convertible subordinated notes in october 2000 

  

income taxes 

  

we recognized income tax expense of 598 million 758 million and 463 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were 397 in fiscal 2003 300 in fiscal 2002 and 320 in fiscal 2001 the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of january 26 2003 we had 103 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 2370 million from the end of fiscal 2002 in august 2001 we began to invest in marketable securities our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions our investment policy requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration 

  

operating activities generated cash of 2650 million 1608 million and 2679 million during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the decrease in inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets offset by the decrease in accounts payable 

  

cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment which include leasehold improvements for our facilities net cash used in investing activities was 2773 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to 2173 million of net purchases of marketable securities we incurred 631 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 primarily attributable to our new headquarters facility as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development we expect to spend approximately 500 million to 600 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 primarily for software licenses emulation equipment computer and engineering workstations and future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets 

  

financing activities provided cash of 263 million during fiscal 2003 compared to 991 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was due to a decrease in employee stock option exercises 

  

common stock and convertible subordinated debenture offering 

  

in october 2000 we sold 2800000 shares of our common stock and 3000 million of convertible subordinated debentures due october 15 2007 in a public offering proceeds from the offering were approximately 3875 million after deducting underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straightline basis over the term of the debentures interest on the convertible subordinated debentures accrues at the rate of 4 ¾ per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year commencing april 15 2001 the convertible subordinated debentures are redeemable at our option on or after october 20 2003 the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date unless previously redeemed or repurchased into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 4636 per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 

  

  

3dfx asset purchase 

  

on april 18 2001 we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx including patents and patent applications under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the cash consideration due at the closing was 700 million less 150 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december 15 2000 the asset purchase agreement also provides subject to the other provisions thereof that if 3dfx certifies to our satisfaction all its debts and other liabilities have been provided for then we are obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock if 3dfx cannot make such a certification but instead certifies to our satisfaction that its debts and liabilities can be satisfied for less than 250 million then 3dfx can elect to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by 2500 per share if 3dfx cannot certify that all of its debts and liabilities have been provided for or can be satisfied for less than 250 million we are not obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets on october 15 2002 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection we believe that the bankruptcy filing by 3dfx will allow a determination of the full number and scope of 3dfx’s debts and liabilities nvidia may be obligated under the asset purchase agreement to pay 3dfx the contingent consideration following this determination subject to offsets for nvidia’s claims against 3dfx arising from the asset purchase agreement on march 12 2003 we were served with a complaint by the trustee for 3dfx seeking among other things additional payment for the purchased assets and the assumption by us of 3dfx’s liabilities in addition carlyle fortran trust and carramerica former landlords of 3dfx have filed suits against us seeking payment of the rents due by 3dfx 

  

contractual cash obligations 

  

the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of january 26 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

  

     

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

  

we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures 

  

which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include 

  

   

   

   

   

for additional factors see “business risks—our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline” 

  

other information 

  

consistent with section 10ai2 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as added by section 202 of the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of 2002 nvidia is responsible for disclosing the nature of the nonaudit services approved by our audit committee during a quarter to be performed by kpmg llp our independent auditor nonaudit services are services other than those provided by kpmg llp in connection with an audit or a review of nvidia’s financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 our audit committee did approve new and recurring engagements performed by kpmg llp for the following nonaudit services 1 income tax transactional tax and payroll tax return preparation 2 general tax consultation and advice 3 international statutory audits and 4 consultation regarding accounting standards and issues 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading “new accounting pronouncements” which information is hereby incorporated by reference 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of investments in commercial paper money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations municipalities and the us government and its agencies these investments are denominated in us dollars 

  

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 115 “sfas no 115” accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under sfas no 115 investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because our debt securities are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax as of january 26 2003 a sensitivity analysis was performed on our floating and fixed rate financial investments parallel shifts in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately 35 million 

  

our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾ and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations 

  

  

exchange rate risk 

  

we consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

business risks 

  

in addition to the risks discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” our business is subject to the risks set forth below 

  

risks related to our operations 

  

our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 

  

many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline perhaps substantially we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operations 

  

factors that have affected our results of operations in the past and could affect our results of operations in the future include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income 

  

our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand therefore we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

  

most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than longterm agreements as a result we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations we may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding writedowns if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 

  

we may be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts our business could suffer accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance in addition the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 

  

we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 

  

our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for the 3d graphics market our addin board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations this requires that we do the following 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future the success of new product introductions will depend on several factors including the following 

  

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by pc oems addin board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of 3d graphics in addition we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the pc oems’ design cycles and market demand we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products our failure to successfully develop introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3d graphics products would harm our business in particular we experienced delays in the introduction of graphics processors using our next generation technology during the second half of fiscal 2003 and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 

  

our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 

  

as our 3d graphics processors develop and competition increases we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline in particular we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our 3d graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases as a result we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins in order for our 3d graphics processors to achieve high volumes leading pc oems and addin board and motherboard manufacturers must select our 3d graphics processor for design into their products and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion new products in addition we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems’ and addin board and motherboard manufacturers’ products that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development introduction or volume shipment of our products we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed in addition we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share in addition technologies developed by others may render our 3d graphics products noncompetitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory any of which would harm our business 

  

we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 

  

products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution as a result our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution 

  

if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing andor new products would reduce our gross margins 

  

semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 

  

the risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our manufacturers increasing the effort and time required to identify communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall our business could suffer 

  

failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively 

  

our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial thirdparty foundries use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs we currently use 015micron process technology for the geforce4 quadro4 geforce3 quadro dcc xbox and nforce families of graphics processors and we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position in november 2002 we introduced our newest flagship gpu the geforce fx 5800 ultra which is our first gpu to be manufactured in 013micron process technology other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels we have experienced and may continue to experience similar difficulties and the corresponding negative effects moreover we are dependent on our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully we may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 

  

we may be unable to manage our growth and as a result may be unable to successfully implement our strategy 

  

our rapid growth has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial operational and financial resources as of january 26 2003 we had 1513 employees as compared to 1123 employees as of january 27 2002 we expect that the number of our employees will increase over the next 12 months our future growth if any will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls further we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties our systems procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy 

  

  

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees none of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement and so our relationships with these officers and employees are at will we do not have “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our executive officers technical personnel or other key employees particularly jenhsun huang our president and chief executive officer would harm our business our success will depend on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 

  

we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 

  

our reliance on foreign thirdparty manufacturing assembly testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 

  

currently all of our arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities although we may do so in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

  

hostilities involving the united states andor terrorist attacks could harm our business 

  

the financial political economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states have led to a weakening of the global economy recent economic data such as the united states unemployment rate and consumer confidence measures appear to indicate that international hostilities involving the united states has further weakened the global economy the reduction in business and investor confidence is also reflected in the weakening equity markets subsequent terrorist acts andor the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers distributors and suppliers which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

failure in operation or future enhancement or implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could harm our operations 

  

during fiscal 2003 we initiated an examination of sap ag our current enterprise resource planning or erp system to enhance our information systems in business finance operations and service during fiscal 2003 we implemented certain additional functionalities based upon the results of the erp examination and we expect 

  

to implement additional functionalities in fiscal 2004 if we are not able to implement additional functionalities to our current erp system or there are delays or downtime as a result of the implementation the efficiency of our business applications and business operations could be harmed we are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems to conduct our business system failure or malfunctioning may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process transactions our results of operations and financial position could be harmed if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to system operations or future implementations 

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

on march 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia 

  

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products 

  

in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels for any previous or future acquisition or investment the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and ultimately could impair our ability to sell our products 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock if the consideration is paid with our common stock existing stockholders would be further diluted 

  

risks related to our partners 

  

we are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties 

  

we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated we primarily sell our products to addin board and motherboard manufacturers and cems which incorporate graphics products in the 

  

boards they sell to pc oems and system builders sales to addin board and motherboard manufacturers and cems are primarily dependent on achieving design wins with leading pc oems the number of addin board and motherboard manufacturers cems and leading pc oems is limited we expect that a small number of addin board and motherboard manufacturers and cems directly and a small number of pc oems indirectly will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future as a result our business could be harmed by the loss of business from pc oems or addin board and motherboard manufacturers and cems in addition revenue from addin board and motherboard manufacturers cems and pc oems that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods individually or as a group may not continue or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 

  

our business may be harmed by instability in asia due to the concentration of customers who are located or have substantial operations in asia including taiwan the people’s republic of china and taiwan have in the past experienced strained relations a worsening of these relationships or the development of hostilities between the two could result in disruptions in taiwan and possibly other areas of asia which could harm our business in addition if relations between the us and the people’s republic of china become strained our business could be harmed while we believe political instability in asia has not harmed our business because of our reliance on companies with operations in asia continued economic and political instability in asia might harm it 

  

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income which could harm our business 

  

our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure excluding the amounts covered by credit insurance if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain credit insurance in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs in the future which could harm our business 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 

  

in the design and development of new products and product enhancements we rely on thirdparty software development tools while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future for example we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from 3d graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands our business could suffer 

  

there can be no assurance that the xbox program will achieve long term commercial success 

  

there can be no assurance that the xbox program will achieve long term commercial success given the high level of competition in the game console product line during fiscal 2003 sales of xbox processors comprised 23 of our overall revenue if the xbox program is not successful our business may be harmed 

  

we depend on foreign foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our business 

  

we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility our products require wafers manufactured with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques we primarily utilize tsmc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent 

  

subcontractors to perform assembly testing and packaging we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis these manufacturers may be unable to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and tsmc has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product tsmc fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice because the leadtime needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 

  

our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc although our products are designed using tsmc’s process design rules tsmc may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis andor at an acceptable cost additionally tsmc may not continue to devote resources to the production of our products or to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based any difficulties like these would harm our business 

  

because of our reliance on tsmc our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan including the worsening of the strained relations between the people’s republic of china and taiwan or if relations between the us and the people’s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events furthermore any substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations either as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability acts of terrorism or war equipment failure or other cause could harm our business 

  

there can be no assurance that ibm will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis 

  

on march 26 2003 we announced that we have formed a multiyear strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our nextgeneration geforce gpus as part of the agreement we will gain access to ibm’s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies including powerefficient copper wiring and a roadmap that is designed to lead to 65nm nanometer a billionth of a meter in the next several years giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus ibm plans to begin manufacturing the nextgeneration geforce graphics processor this summer at ibm’s plant in east fishkill new york 

  

during the development of our relationship with ibm our manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of ibm any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall our business could suffer 

  

we are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products 

  

our graphics processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd amkor technology chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering we do not have longterm agreements with any of these subcontractors as a result of our dependence on thirdparty subcontractors for assembly testing and packaging of our products we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business due to the amount of time 

  

typically required to qualify assemblers and testers we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business 

  

risks related to our competition 

  

the 3d graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 

  

the market for 3d graphics processors for pcs in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of graphics processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3d graphics processors or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products we may be unable to compete successfully in the emerging pc graphics market 

  

our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide 3d graphics solutions for the pc market our competitors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

if and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3d graphics processor market we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 

  

we may not successfully compete with intel in the integrated chipset product line 

  

it is projected by analysts that integrated chipsets are likely to become a majority share of the pc graphics market we have recently introduced and begun shipment of the nforce2 platform processor our second generation integrated 3d graphics chipset the nforce platform processor is initially designed to support microprocessors produced by amd intel is the dominant supplier of integrated 3d graphics chipsets intel has significantly greater resources than we do and the nforce platform processor or other 3d graphics products that we may introduce may not compete effectively against intel’s current chipset products or its future products either in terms of price or performance 

  

in addition due to the widespread industry acceptance of intel’s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture including its accelerated graphics port architecture or agp intel exercises significant influence over the pc industry and over companies developing products for such architecture any significant modifications by intel to the agp the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects of the pc microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our technology which would harm our business 

  

in addition any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm our business 

  

in addition to its influence over the pc architecture intel has asserted intellectual property rights in various pc architecture interfaces for example as a result of patents held by intel it has asserted that companies wishing to develop a chipset compatible with the pentium 4 microprocessor or similar microprocessors obtain a license from intel we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels backwardforward software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capabilities price of graphics processors and total system costs of addin boards and motherboards in september 2001 intel filed a patent infringement suit against via technologies inc with respect to a via technologies inc chipset for the pentium 4 we do not have a license from intel for such a chipset 

  

we expect intel to continue to do the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 

  

our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the 3d graphics processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems and addin board and motherboard manufacturers our addin board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year generally based on spring and fall design cycles accordingly our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business the process of being qualified for inclusion in a pc oem’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature which also could harm our business 

  

our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers including intel and microsoft this would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 

  

risks related to financial and market conditions 

  

we are dependent on the pc market and the slowdown in its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

  

during fiscal 2003 we derived most of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc market from professional workstations to lowcost pcs we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc market in the next several years the pc market is 

  

characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions and significant price competition these factors result in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product a reduction in sales of pcs or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales will reduce demand for our products moreover changes in demand could be large and sudden since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed the slowing of both the domestic and international economy has led to a reduction in the demand for pcs and to a reduction in inventory purchases by pc manufacturers which adversely impacted our revenue during fiscal 2003 any continued reduction in the demand for pcs generally or for a particular product that incorporates our 3d graphic processors could harm our business 

  

the acceptance of next generation products in business pc 3d graphics may not continue to develop 

  

our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3d graphics for business pc applications the market for performance 3d graphics on business pcs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future development of and substantial enduser and oem demand for 3d graphics functionality as a result the market for business pc 3d graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support our business the development of the market for performance 3d graphics in business pcs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a large number of business pc software applications that support or take advantage of performance 3d graphics capabilities currently there are only a limited number of software applications like this most of which are games and a broader base of software applications may not develop in the near term or at all consequently a broad market for full function performance 3d graphics on business pcs may not develop our business prospects will suffer if the market for business pc 3d graphics fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected 

  

our 3d graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the pc market 

  

our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our 3d graphics processors for high performance 3d graphics in pc applications the market for 3d graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition since the pc market is our core business our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future 3d graphics processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and costeffectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc market our business would be harmed 

  

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

in addition the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions 

  

our stock price may continue to experience significant shortterm fluctuations 

  

the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are noncompany specific such as the decline in the us economy acts of terror against the us war or due to a variety of company specific factors including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s stock securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing company since february 2002 multiple securities class action lawsuits and several derivative suits have been filed against us we expect that this litigation whether or not resolved favorably may result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could harm our revenues and earnings any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities see “legal proceedings” and note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of this litigation 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 

  

for additional information regarding risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

  

risks related to intellectual property litigation and government action 

  

our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation the 3d graphics market in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions in addition from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition in our product lines intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase if infringement claims are made against us we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights however licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly by competitors the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products which could reduce our revenues and harm our business furthermore we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products 

  

litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

  

we are currently subject to claims of patent infringement and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other parties in the future we do not believe that current actions will have a material impact on our business or financial condition however these claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages 

  

  

our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the crosslicensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could suffer 

  

future actions by the sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies and resolution of related litigation arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters could harm our business 

  

the staff of the enforcement division of the securities  exchange commission “sec” informed us in january 2002 that it had concerns relating to certain accounting matters and that the sec along with the us attorney’s office for the northern district of california had authorized investigations into such matters in accordance with the suggestion and advice of the sec staff we launched a review of these matters on april 29 2002 we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had with assistance from the law firm of cooley godward llp and forensic auditors from the accounting firm of kpmg llp concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate our financial statements for fiscal 2000 2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 the audit committee has worked and continues to work in cooperation with the sec after receiving a wells notice indicating the sec staff intended to recommend to the sec that an enforcement action be initiated we reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff in april 2003 that would resolve the sec’s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement the agreement is subject to final approval of the sec under the terms of the agreement in principle nvidia without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing would agree to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain nonfraud financial reporting books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws we would not be required to pay any fines or penalties the documentation of the agreement and the sec’s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete further there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the sec notwithstanding the above actions by the sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies with respect to us or our personnel arising out of the restatement of our financial statements or other matters may take significant time may be expensive and may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and harm our business

controls and procedures 

  

our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer after evaluating the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c as of a date the “evaluation date” within 90 days before the filing date of this annual report have concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and designed to ensure that material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities 

  

there were no significant changes in our internal controls or to our knowledge in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures subsequent to the evaluation date 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the 

  

objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within nvidia have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected
