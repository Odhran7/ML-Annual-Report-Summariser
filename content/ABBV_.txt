marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states many of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders payers physicians and health systems abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products throughout the covid19 pandemic abbvie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses certain products including aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to retailers pharmacies patients or other customers in 2021 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies pharmaceutical product sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 37 of abbvies 2021 gross revenues in the united states outside the united states abbvie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors depending on the market served 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products therapies 



and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products jak inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and mavyretmaviret competes with other available hcv treatment options in addition in the past few years a number of other companies have started to develop have successfully developed andor are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to botox the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional smallmolecule pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products 

humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in europe and other countries and abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the ffdca the public health service act phsa and the regulations implementing these statutes the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the phsa but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is complex approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered by the fda as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its full ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the ffdca the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the phsa are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity specific conditions of use approved for 



individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities patent and regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available such as generating new antibiotic incentives now gain exclusivity which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over followon biosimilar products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in october 2018 in the majority of european union countries in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 abbvie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures under the agreements the licenses in the united states will begin in 2023 and the licenses in europe began in 2018 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica and those related to risankizumab which is sold under the trademark skyrizi the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to march 30 2032 assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted the united states composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 



licensing acquisitions and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions optiontoacquire agreements licensing arrangements optiontolicense arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures the acquisitions and optiontoacquire agreements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable purchase price payments or option fees option exercise payments milestones or earnouts and other customary terms and obligations the licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees option fees and option exercise payments milestone payments and royalty andor profit sharing obligations see note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development product distribution analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by covid19 abbvie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact except for the previouslydisclosed nearterm supply issues impacting lupron given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic abbvie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand 

research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds and complementary devices in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio abbvie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase 1— involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety tolerability and doses for later phases 

• phase 2— tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy 

• phase 3— tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval 

preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 



the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products delivery devices and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor investigator sites laboratories hospitals and manufacturing facilities of abbvies subcontractors or other thirdparty manufacturers failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda including rejection of an nda or bla 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the fda prior to implementation the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials patient registries observational data or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future further the fda continues to regulate product labeling and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses along with other labeling restrictions 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda japanspecific trials andor bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

similarly applications for a new product in china are submitted to the center for drug evaluation cde of the national medical products administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in china clinical data in chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in china requiring the inclusion of china in global pivotal studies or a separate chinaasian clinical trial 



the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process similar to the requirements in japan and china certain countries notably south korea taiwan india and russia also generally require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacturing marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payers and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing political and budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in 



addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 70 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2022 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is difficult to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of genericbiosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 



regulation – medical devices 

medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda state agencies and foreign government health authorities fda regulations as well as various us federal and state laws govern the development clinical testing manufacturing labeling record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the united states abbvie’s medical device product candidates including abbvie’s breast implants must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the united states and other countries the lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources regulatory clearance or approval when and if obtained may be limited in scope and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture sale andor use or require their withdrawal from the market 

united states  abbvie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states unless an exemption applies each medical device abbvie markets in the united states must have a 510k clearance or a premarket approval application pma in accordance with the ffdca and its implementing regulations the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either class i or class ii and devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or implantable devices or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device are placed in class iii in general a class iii device cannot be marketed in the united states unless the fda approves the device after submission of a pma and any changes to the device subsequent to initial fda approval must also be reviewed and approved by the fda the majority of abbvie’s medical device products including abbvie’s breast implants are regulated as class iii medical devices a class iii device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic unannounced facility inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of abbvie’s subcontractors or other thirdparty manufacturers failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall or seizure of abbvie’ products operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusing abbvie’ request for 510k clearance or pma approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or pma approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide which must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound a study sponsor must obtain approval for its ide from the fda and it must also obtain approval of its study from the institutional review board overseeing the trial the results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device 

once a device is approved the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the fda including quality system regulation requirements which involve design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the fda and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements manufacturers must also report to the fda if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the ffdca that may present a health risk further the fda continues to regulate device labeling and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses along with other labeling restrictions 

european union medical device products that are marketed in the european union must comply with the requirements of the medical device regulation the mdr which came into effect in may 2021 the mdr provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design manufacture clinical trials labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the european union are safe and effective for their intended uses medical devices that comply with the mdr are entitled to bear a conformité européenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the european union failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect abbvie’s ability to market and sell abbvie’s products in these countries 



environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were approximately 17 million and operating expenditures were approximately 33 million in 2022 capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately 14 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 34 million 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 50000 employees in over 70 countries as of january 31 2022 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

equity equality diversity  inclusion eedi a cornerstone of abbvie’s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce in 2019 abbvie adopted a fiveyear equality diversity  inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas objectives and associated initiatives and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography abbvie’s senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy in recent years abbvies board of directors has prioritized oversight of abbvies response to the us racial justice movement including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that abbvie is attracting retaining and developing diverse talent through december 2021 women represented 51 percent of management positions globally and in the united states 35 percent of abbvies workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations an increase from 2020 further abbvie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually a critical component of abbvies strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all abbvie leaders and employees so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement abbvie recently launched a new resource for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of eedi to the business educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior and encourage participation in the companys inclusive culture learning opportunities abbvies employee resource groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities in 2021 abbvie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by among other things expanding its employee matching program to 3to1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity additional information about abbvies efforts on racial equality and social justice is provided on the companys website at httpsabbviecomourcompanyequalityinclusiondiversityourcommitmenttoracialjusticehtml 

covid19 health and safety abbvie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the covid19 pandemic while continuing to drive strong business performance abbvie implemented among other things temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on abbvies business and employees establishment of physical distancing procedures modification of workspaces and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees provision of onsite vaccinations and temperature screenings a variety of testing and vaccination resources including onsite vaccinations and onsite and athome testing and covid case management programs and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees’ needs for flexibility in addition covid19 is a covered event under the abbvie employee assistance funds employee relief program entitling eligible abbvie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgagerent utilities food childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance abbvie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the companys employees with relevant medical pharmaceutical research and development science public health and public safety skills knowledge training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic lastly abbvie’s commitment to employees has been evidenced by no workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with covid19

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to abbvies business and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

public health outbreaks epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus covid19 have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and financial condition 

public health outbreaks epidemics or pandemics have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and financial condition the continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has caused many countries including the united states to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lockdown orders some of which have eased the continuation or reimplementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has caused abbvie to modify its business practices including instituting remote work for many of abbvie’s employees and abbvie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as abbvie determines are in the best interests of abbvie’s employees patients customers and business partners 

while the impact of covid19 on abbvie’s operations including among others its manufacturing and supply chain sales and marketing commercial and clinical trial operations to date has not been material abbvie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets the impact of covid19 on abbvie over the longterm is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence the extent of the adverse impact of covid19 on abbvie’s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of covid19 globally the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to covid19 and the resulting economic consequences ultimately efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 may not completely prevent abbvies business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics biosimilars or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 207 billion in 2021 expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 



abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged circumvented or weakened or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 37 of abbvies total net revenues in 2021 any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira as described further in “— the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care 



inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 

biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with abbvie’s biologic products including humira as competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products 



and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and mavyretmaviret competes with other available hepatitis c treatment options in addition in the past few years a number of other companies have started to develop have successfully developed andor are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to botox all of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology hematologic oncology aesthetics neuroscience eye care and womens health abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

certain aspects of abbvie’s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers 

abbvie relies on suppliers vendors and other third party service providers to research develop manufacture commercialize promote and sell its products reliance on third party manufacturers reduces abbvie’s oversight and control of the manufacturing process some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements privacy and security risks and market risks of their own the failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and results if any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to abbvie it is possible that abbvie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes including possible legal consequences 

significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be 



taken by such regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

abbvie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients for example lawsuits are pending against allergan abbvie’s recently acquired subsidiary and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding allergan’s textured breast implants product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

abbvie is also the subject of other claims legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business which relate to the intellectual property commercial securities and other matters adverse outcomes in such claims legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect abbvie’s business and results of operations additionally allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed see note 15 legal proceedings and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data abbvie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 



abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development” “business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing” and “business—regulation—medical devices” the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act the us physician payments sunshine act the tricare program the government pricing rules applicable to the medicaid medicare part b 340b drug pricing program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states made up approximately 23 of abbvies total net revenues in 2021 the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs 

• multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvies ability to manufacture market and sell its products 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• international trade disruptions or disputes 

• difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws 



• political and economic instability including as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and the covid19 pandemic 

• sovereign debt issues 

• price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action and regulation 

• inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates 

• restrictions on transfers of funds 

• potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain nonus countries and 

• potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 

events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

if abbvie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products abbvies revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected 

abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sales ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredients for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers abbvies products to its customers the commercialization of abbvie products may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications the relative price of abbvies product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a products label that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of abbvies principal products is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected 

abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements joint ventures and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances joint ventures restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2021 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies pharmaceutical product sales in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 



abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business in particular abbvie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of allergan abbvie’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of among other things reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions andor lowering its credit ratings to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase these risks could increase further in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy disruption degradation or breakdown data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations such breaches may cause sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging to abbvie its patients customers or business partners to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public to date abbvie’s business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from abbvie’s or thirdparty providers’ databases or it systems and could also result in legal financial reputational or business harm to abbvie and potentially substantial remediation costs 

in connection with the acquisition of allergan abbvie’s balances of intangible assets including developed product rights and goodwill acquired have increased significantly such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges which will adversely affect abbvie’s results of operations and financial condition 

a significant amount of abbvie’s total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill as of december 31 2021 the carrying value of abbvie’s developed product rights and other intangible assets was 760 billion and the carrying value of abbvie’s goodwill was 324 billion 

abbvie’s developed product rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization abbvie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products significant adverse changes to any of these factors require abbvie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and if evidence of impairment exists require abbvie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset for assets that are not impaired abbvie may adjust the remaining useful lives such a charge could have a material adverse effect on abbvie’s results of operations and financial condition 

abbvie’s other significant intangible assets include inprocess research and development iprd intangible projects acquired in recent business combinations which are indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and abbvie’s iprd intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount a goodwill or iprd impairment if any would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on abbvie’s results of operations and financial condition 



failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect abbvie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products 

abbvie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract develop and retain diverse highly qualified scientific technical and management personnel as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development rd governmental regulation and commercialization competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense abbvie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards data privacy laws particularly in the european union and the united states and environmental laws 

• differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pension and postemployment benefits stockbased compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount 

• changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbvies equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts 

• changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbvie or its employee benefit trusts 

• environmental liabilities in connection with abbvie’s manufacturing processes and distribution logistics including the handling of hazardous materials 

• changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology accounting human resources payroll and other outsourced services to abbvie to meet their contractual obligations to abbvie 

• business interruptions stemming from natural disasters such as climate change earthquakes hurricanes flooding fires or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters and 

• changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 



in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

• the inability of abbvies stockholders to call a special meeting 

• the division of abbvies board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term 

• a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause 

• the ability of abbvies directors and not stockholders to fill vacancies on abbvies board of directors and 

• the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 of abbvies voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvies amended and restated bylaws relating to the number term and election of abbvies directors the filling of board vacancies the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

there were no changes to the companys credit ratings during 2021 following the acquisition of allergan in 2020 sp global ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to bbb from a and the shortterm rating to a2 from a1 there were no changes in moodys investor service of its baa2 senior unsecured longterm rating and prime2 shortterm rating with a stable outlook

collaborations licensing and other arrangements 

abbvie enters into collaborative licensing and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled 339 billion in 2021 270 billion in 2020 and 188 billion in 2019 rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks which comprise approximately 95 of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 

a represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the allergan acquisition 

cash discounts and product returns 

cash discounts and product returns which totaled 36 billion in 2021 24 billion in 2020 and 16 billion in 2019 are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other postemployment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 



the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yieldcurve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve abbvie reflects the plans specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate 

abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2021 a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2021 

the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022 a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by 101 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022 

income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in 



the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved the potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probabilityweighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a monte carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments which are then discounted to present value changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs which are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen canadian dollar chinese yuan and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2021 and 2020 

the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 14 billion at december 31 2021 if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts however gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2021 the company has €59 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes outstanding which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the senior euro notes and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 244 million at december 31 2021 if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 50 billion at december 31 2021 a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates

abbvie has the rights to sell creon and synthroid only in the united states abbvies commercial rights to the sale and distribution of synagis outside of the united states will revert to astrazeneca upon the expiry of the current agreement in 2021 

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states many of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders payers physicians and health systems abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products throughout the covid19 pandemic abbvie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses certain products including aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 



in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to retailers pharmacies and patients in 2020 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 38 of abbvies 2020 gross revenues in the united states outside the united states abbvie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors depending on the market served 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products therapies and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and mavyretmaviret competes with other available hcv treatment options in addition in the past few years a number of other companies have started to develop have successfully developed andor are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to botox the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products 

humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in europe and other countries and abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the ffdca the public health service act phsa and the regulations implementing such acts the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the phsa but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is complex approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered by the fda as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states 



the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the ffdca the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the phsa are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities patent and regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available such as generating new antibiotic incentives now gain exclusivity which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over followon biosimilar products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2021 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in october 2018 in the majority of european union countries in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 abbvie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures under the agreements the license in the united states will begin in 2023 and the license in europe began in 2018 



in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica and those related to risankizumab which is sold under the trademark skyrizi the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

licensing acquisitions and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions optiontoacquire agreements licensing arrangements optiontolicense arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures the acquisitions and optiontoacquire agreements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable purchase price payments or option fees option exercise payments milestones or earnouts and other customary terms and obligations the licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees option fees and option exercise payments milestone payments and royalty andor profit sharing obligations see note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development product distribution analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers other than the lupron nearterm supply issue which has impacted availability of certain formulations abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand 

research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio abbvie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions 



the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety tolerability and potential dosing 

• phase 2—tests the drugs efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients 

• phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria 

the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the fda prior to implementation the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials patient registries observational data or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future further the fda continues to regulate product labeling and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses along with other labeling restrictions 



outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency ema after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda japanspecific trials andor bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

similarly applications for a new product in china are submitted to the center for drug evaluation cde of the national medical products administration nmpa for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in china clinical data in chinese subjects are required to support approval in china requiring the inclusion of china in global pivotal studies or a separate chinaasian clinical trial 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process similar to the requirements in japan and china certain countries notably south korea taiwan and russia also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 



access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payers and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing political and budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 50 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2021 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 



most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of genericbiosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

regulation – medical devices 

medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda state agencies and foreign government health authorities fda regulations as well as various us federal and state laws govern the development clinical testing manufacturing labeling record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the united states abbvie’s medical device product candidates including abbvie’s breast implants must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the united states and other countries the lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources regulatory clearance or approval when and if obtained may be limited in scope and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture sale andor use or require their withdrawal from the market 

united states  abbvie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states unless an exemption applies each medical device abbvie markets in the united states must have a 510k clearance or a premarket approval application pma in accordance with the ffdca and its implementing regulations the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either class i or class ii and devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or implantable devices or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device are placed in class iii in general a class iii device cannot be marketed in the united states unless the fda approves the device after submission of a pma and any changes to the device subsequent to initial fda approval must also be reviewed and approved by the fda the majority of abbvie’s medical device products including abbvie’s breast implants are regulated as class iii medical devices a class iii device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic unannounced facility inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of abbvie’s subcontractors or other thirdparty manufacturers failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall or seizure of abbvie’ products operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusing abbvie’ request for 510k clearance or pma approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or pma approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide which must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound a study sponsor must obtain approval for its ide from the fda and it must also obtain approval of its study from the institutional review board irb overseeing the trial the results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device 



once a device is approved the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the fda including quality system regulation requirements which involve design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the fda and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements manufacturers must also report to the fda if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the ffdca that may present a health risk further the fda continues to regulate device labeling and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses along with other labeling restrictions 

european union medical device products that are marketed in the european union must comply with the requirements of the medical device regulation the mdr which will come into effect in may 2021 the mdr provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design manufacture clinical trials labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the european union are safe and effective for their intended uses medical devices that comply with the mdr are entitled to bear a conformité européenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the european union failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect abbvie’s ability to market and sell abbvie’s products in these countries 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were approximately 6 million and operating expenditures were approximately 34 million in 2021 capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately 9 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 36 million 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 47000 employees in over 70 countries as of january 31 2021 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 



you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to abbvies business and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

public health outbreaks epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus covid19 have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and financial condition 

public health outbreaks epidemics or pandemics have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and financial condition the continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has caused many countries including the united states to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lockdown orders some of which have eased the continuation or reimplementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has caused abbvie to modify its business practices including instituting remote work for many of abbvie’s employees and abbvie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as abbvie determines are in the best interests of abbvie’s employees patients customers and business partners 

while the impact of covid19 on abbvie’s operations including among others its manufacturing and supply chain sales and marketing commercial and clinical trial operations todate has not been material abbvie has experienced lower 



new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio the impact of covid19 on abbvie over the longterm is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence the extent of the adverse impact of covid19 on abbvie’s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of covid19 globally the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to covid19 and the resulting economic consequences ultimately the outbreak could have a material adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and financial condition 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics biosimilars or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 198 billion in 2020 expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 

abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged circumvented or weakened or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful 



claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 43 of abbvies total net revenues in 2020 any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira as described further in “— the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 



biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with abbvie’s biologic products including humira as competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and mavyretmaviret competes with other available hepatitis c treatment options in addition in the past few years a number of other companies have started to develop have successfully developed andor are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to botox all of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology hematologic oncology aesthetics neuroscience eye care and womens health abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 



abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

certain aspects of abbvie’s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers 

abbvie relies on suppliers vendors and other third party service providers to research develop manufacture commercialize promote and sell its products reliance on third party manufacturers reduces abbvie’s oversight and control of the manufacturing process some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements privacy and security risks and market risks of their own the failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on abbvie’s operations and results if any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to abbvie it is possible that abbvie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes including possible legal consequences 

significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

abbvie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients for example lawsuits are pending against allergan abbvie’s newly acquired subsidiary and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding allergan’s textured breast implants product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

abbvie is also the subject of other claims legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business which relate to the intellectual property commercial securities and other matters adverse outcomes in such claims legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect abbvie’s business and results of operations additionally allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3100 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain 



relievers and additional suits may be filed see note 15 legal proceedings and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data abbvie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 

abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development” “business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing” and “business—regulation—medical devices” the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 



laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act the us physician payments sunshine act the tricare program the government pricing rules applicable to the medicaid medicare part b 340b drug pricing program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states made up approximately 24 of abbvies total net revenues in 2020 the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs 

• multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvies ability to manufacture market and sell its products 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• international trade disruptions or disputes 

• difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws 

• political and economic instability including as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and the covid19 pandemic 

• sovereign debt issues 

• price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action and regulation 

• inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates 

• restrictions on transfers of funds 

• potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain nonus countries including in europe and latin america and 

• potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 

events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 



if abbvie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products abbvies revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected 

abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sales ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredients for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers abbvies products to its customers the commercialization of abbvie products may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications the relative price of abbvies product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a products label that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of abbvies principal products is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected 

abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements joint ventures and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances joint ventures restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2020 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business in particular abbvie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of allergan abbvie’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of among other things reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions andor lowering its credit ratings to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase these risks could increase further in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie

an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans

certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

• the inability of abbvies stockholders to call a special meeting 

• the division of abbvies board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term 



• a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause 

• the ability of abbvies directors and not stockholders to fill vacancies on abbvies board of directors and 

• the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 of abbvies voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvies amended and restated bylaws relating to the number term and election of abbvies directors the filling of board vacancies the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

results of operations 

net revenues 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

net revenues for lupron decreased 14 in 2020 primarily due to a nearterm supply issue which has impacted product availability of certain formulations 

gross margin 



gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value stepup adjustments associated with the allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for imbruvica and venclexta 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 increased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of incremental sga expenses of allergan including transaction and integration costs resulting from the acquisition 

research and development and acquired inprocess research and development 



research and development rd expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2020 primarily due to the 10 billion intangible asset impairment charge in 2019 which represented the remaining value of the iprd acquired as part 



of the 2016 stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to terminate the rovat rd program see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge rd expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 were also favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company for the period subsequent to the completion of the allergan acquisition 

acquired iprd expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations acquired iprd expense in 2020 included a charge of 750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with genmab as genmab to research develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer acquired iprd expense in 2020 also included a charge of 200 million as a result of a collaboration agreement with imab biopharma imab for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the genmab and imab agreements there were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019

other nonoperating expenses 



interest expense in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with the financing of the allergan acquisition as well as the incremental allergan debt acquired partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s debt obligations 

interest income in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates 

other expense net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of 58 billion in 2020 and 31 billion in 2019 the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs including the probability of success of achieving regulatorycommercial milestones discount rates the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other marketbased factors in 2020 the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates in 2019 the skyrizi contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success higher estimated future sales declining interest rates and passage of time the higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the april 2019 regulatory approvals of skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis these changes were partially offset by a 91 million decrease in the stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the rovat rd program 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate was negative 36 in 2020 6 in 2019 and negative 9 in 2018 the effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the united states tax incentives in puerto rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions business development activities changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring the cost of repatriation decisions tax audit settlements and boehringer ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the recognition of a net tax benefit of 17 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring including certain intragroup transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement 



financial position liquidity and capital resources 



operating cash flows in 2020 increased from 2019 and included the results of allergan subsequent to the may 8 acquisition date operating cash flows in 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows partially offset by acquisitionrelated cash expenses operating cash flows also reflected abbvie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of 367 million in 2020 and 727 million in 2019 

investing cash flows in 2020 primarily included 397 billion cash consideration paid to acquire allergan offset by cash acquired of 15 billion investing cash flows also included net sales and maturities of investments totaling 15 billion payments made for other acquisitions and investments of 14 billion and capital expenditures of 798 million investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling 21 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the companys investments in debt securities payments made for other acquisitions and investments of 11 billion and capital expenditures of 552 million

cash dividend payments totaled 77 billion in 2020 and 64 billion in 2019 the increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of abbvie common stock issued to allergan shareholders in may 2020 as well as an increase in the dividend rate on october 30 2020 abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 118 per share to 130 per share beginning with the dividend payable on february 16 2021 to stockholders of record as of january 15 2021 this reflects an increase of approximately 102 over the previous quarterly rate the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends by abbvie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors 

the companys stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of abbvie shares from time to time in openmarket or private transactions at management’s discretion the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time under this authorization abbvie repurchased 8 million shares for 757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for 300 million in 2019 abbvie cashsettled 201 million of its december 2018 open market purchases in january 2019 abbvies remaining stock repurchase authorization was 32 billion as of december 31 2020 

in 2020 and 2019 the company issued and redeemed commercial paper there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 abbvie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed 

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an 



allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable abbvie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

abbvie currently has a 40 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that matures in august 2024 this amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2020 the company was in compliance with all covenants and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant no amounts were outstanding under the companys credit facility as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

following the acquisition of allergan sp global ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to bbb from a and the shortterm rating to a2 from a1 there were no changes in moodys investor service of its baa2 senior unsecured longterm rating and prime2 shortterm rating with a stable outlook 

unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



a includes estimated future interest payments on longterm debt interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2020 projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2020 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys debt instruments and note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december 31 2020 

b includes the companys significant unconditional purchase obligations these commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business 

c excludes liabilities associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits 



d includes 130 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these liabilities 

e includes a onetime transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from us tax reform enacted in 2017 the onetime transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments 

abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration abbvie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services sales value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue abbvie generates revenue primarily from product sales for the majority of sales the company transfers control invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled 270 billion in 2020 188 billion in 2019 and 164 billion in 2018 rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 



the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 89 of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2020 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



a represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the allergan acquisition 

cash discounts and product returns 

cash discounts and product returns which totaled 24 billion in 2020 16 billion in 2019 and 16 billion in 2018 are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other postemployment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yieldcurve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve abbvie reflects the plans specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate 

abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2020 a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2021 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 





the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021 a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2021 by 94 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021 

income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed 



for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved the potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probabilityweighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a monte carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments which are then discounted to present value changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period the fair value of the companys contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs 



a unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities 

b excludes early stage indications with 0 estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100 probability of payment excluding approved indications the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56 to 89 at december 31 2020

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen canadian dollar and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 and 2019 



the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 114 billion at december 31 2020 if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts however gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2020 the company has € 66 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes outstanding which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the senior euro notes and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 111 million at december 31 2020 if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 57 billion at december 31 2020 a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates

disclosure controls and procedures internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the chief executive officer richard a gonzalez and the chief financial officer robert a michael evaluated the effectiveness of abbvies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that abbvies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information abbvie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by abbvie in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to abbvies management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2020 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

sevoflurane sevoflurane sold under the trademarks ultane and sevorane is an anesthesia product that abbvie sells worldwide for human use 

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payers physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 



in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2019  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42 of abbvies 2019 gross revenues in the united states outside the united states abbvie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors depending on the market served these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with other available hcv treatment options the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products 

humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in europe and other countries and abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is complex approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for 



patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the public health service act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities patent and regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over followon biosimilar products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2020 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in october 2018 in the majority of european union countries in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 abbvie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures under the agreements the license in the united states will begin in 2023 and the license in europe began in 2018 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir which are sold under the trademarks mavyret and maviret the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently 



discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

licensing acquisitions and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions optiontoacquire agreements licensing arrangements optiontolicense arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures the acquisitions and optiontoacquire agreements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable purchase price payments or option fees option exercise payments milestones or earnouts and other customary terms and obligations the licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees option fees and option exercise payments milestone payments and royalty andor profit sharing obligations see note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements — other licensing  acquisitions activity  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development product distribution analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements — other licensing  acquisitions activity  to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand 

research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

 the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 



the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda prior to implementation the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials patient registries observational data or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency ema after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory 



procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payers and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing political and budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 50 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and 



teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2020 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of genericbiosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2019 were approximately 29 million and operating expenditures were approximately 34 million  in 2020  capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately 5 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 35 million  

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 



employees 

abbvie employed approximately 30000 persons as of january 31 2020  outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 



you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to abbvies business risks related to abbvies proposed acquisition of allergan the acquisition and the combined company upon completion of the acquisition and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics biosimilars or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1   business —intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3   legal proceedings  the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 192 billion in 2019  expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 



abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged circumvented or weakened or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

  a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

  any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 58 of abbvies total net revenues in 2019  any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira as described further in “— the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

  

abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process 



including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

  a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 

  biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  

abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with abbvie’s biologic products including humira as competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant 



exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

  new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis c treatment options these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease oncology and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

  the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

  abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

  

significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken 



by such regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

  abbvie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

abbvie is also the subject of other claims legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business which relate to the intellectual property commercial securities and other matters adverse outcomes in such claims legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect abbvie’s business and results of operations 

  abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

  



abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1   business —regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states made up approximately 28 of abbvies total net revenues in 2019  the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 





 events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

  if abbvie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products abbvies revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected 

abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sales ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredients for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers abbvies products to its customers the commercialization of abbvie products may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications the relative price of abbvies product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a products label that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of abbvies principal products is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected 

  abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of allergan technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

  

abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2019  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 



abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

  abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

  abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy disruption degradation or breakdown data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging to abbvie its patients customers or business partners to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from abbvie’s or thirdparty providers’ databases or it systems and could also result in legal financial reputational or business harm to abbvie and potentially substantial remediation costs 

failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect abbvie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products 

abbvie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific technical and management personnel as well as personnel with expertise in clinical rd governmental regulation and commercialization competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense abbvie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase 

  other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 





   

risks related to the acquisition and the combined company upon completion of the acquisition 

the pending acquisition of allergan may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits

the indebtedness of the combined company following the consummation of the acquisition will be substantially greater than abbvie’s indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of abbvie and allergan prior to the announcement of the acquisition this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs

risks related to abbvies common stock 

  abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5   market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

  an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions 



including abbvies pending acquisition of allergan or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

  certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

cash dividend payments totaled 64 billion in 2019  56 billion in 2018 and 41 billion in 2017  the increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate on november 1 2019  abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 107 per share to 118 per share beginning with the dividend payable on february 14 2020 to stockholders of record as of january 15 2020  this reflects an increase of approximately 103 over the previous quarterly rate the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends by abbvie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies 



debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected abbvie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

in august 2019 abbvie entered into an amended and restated 40 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that matures in august 2024 this amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2019  the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant no amounts were outstanding under the companys credit facilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 



credit ratings 

following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of allergan and the 300 billion senior notes issuance moodys investor service affirmed its baa2 senior unsecured longterm rating and prime2 shortterm rating with a stable outlook sp global ratings revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable and expects to lower the issuer credit rating by one notch to bbb from a and the shortterm rating to a2 from a1 when the acquisition is complete 

unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  



 abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual 



obligations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration abbvie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services sales value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue abbvie generates revenue primarily from product sales for the majority of sales the company transfers control invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold rebates and chargebacks totaled 188 billion in 2019  164 billion in 2018 and 129 billion in 2017  rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 



the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 94 of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2019  remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



cash discounts and product returns 

cash discounts and product returns which totaled 16 billion in 2019  16 billion in 2018 and 13 billion in 2017  are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other postemployment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements  

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yieldcurve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve abbvie reflects the plans specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2019  a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2019  



the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the 



current longterm rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020  a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2020 by 71 million  

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020  a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019  



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors the overall financial 



performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved the potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probabilityweighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a monte carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments which are then discounted to present value changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period at december 31 2019  a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreasedincreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 280 million  additionally at december 31 2019  a five percentage point increasedecrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increaseddecreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 150 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen canadian dollar and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018  



the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 942 million at december 31 2019  if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts however gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2019  the company has €36 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes outstanding which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the senior euro notes and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 280 million at december 31 2019  if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 50 billion at december 31 2019  a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payers physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses  although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients  in 2018  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42  of abbvies 2018  gross revenues in the united states outside the united states products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors depending on the market served  these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies  abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business no material portion of abbvies 



business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with other available hcv treatment options the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products 

humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in europe and other countries which represent approximately 75 of abbvies international humira business or approximately 25 of total global humira revenues abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other followon versions of small molecule products approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after 



regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the public health service act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities patent and regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2019 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in october 2018 in the majority of european union countries in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir which are sold under the trademarks mavyret and maviret the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 



licensing and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements optiontolicense arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures these licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees option fees and option exercise payments if applicable milestone payments and royalty andor profit sharing obligations see note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements —other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements  included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development product distribution analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements —other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements  included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand 

research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

 the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 



in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda prior to implementation the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials patient registries observational data or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency ema after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw 



materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payers and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing political and budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 50 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of 



countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2019 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of genericbiosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2018  were approximately 20 million  and operating expenditures were approximately 31 million  in 2019  capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately 26 million  and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 33 million  

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 



employees 

abbvie employed approximately 30000  persons as of january 31 2019 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 



  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to abbvies business and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics biosimilars or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1   business —intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3   legal proceedings  the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 199 billion  in 2018  expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent expired in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 



  abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes  review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

  a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

  any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 61 of abbvies total net revenues in 2018  any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

  abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of 



competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

  a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 

  biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with abbvie’s biologic products including humira as competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 



  new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis c treatment options these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease oncology and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

  the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

  abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

  significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product 



withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

  abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

  abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

  abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1   business —regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and 



field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states make up approximately 34  of abbvies total net revenues in 2018  the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

 events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 



  if abbvie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products abbvies revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected 

abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sales ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredients for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers abbvies products to its customers the commercialization of abbvie products may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications the relative price of abbvies product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a products label that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of abbvies principal products is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected 

  abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

  abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2018  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

  abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate 



funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

  abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy disruption degradation or breakdown data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging to abbvie its patients customers or business partners to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from abbvie’s or thirdparty providers’ databases or it systems and could also result in legal financial reputational or business harm to abbvie and potentially substantial remediation costs 

  other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

  abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5   market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 



  an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

  certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

results of operations 

net revenues 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected global economic conditions and customerspecific factors may require the company to periodically reevaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses abbvie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

in august 2018 abbvie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new 30 billion   five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant no  amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

there were no changes in the company’s credit ratings during 2018  unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt obligations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  





 abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration abbvie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services sales value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue abbvie generates revenue primarily from product sales for the majority of sales the company transfers control invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer 



rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold rebates and chargebacks totaled 164 billion  in 2018  129 billion  in 2017  and 108 billion  in 2016  rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 91  of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2018  remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



cash discounts and product returns 

cash discounts and product returns which totaled 16 billion  in 2018  13 billion in 2017  and 964 million in 2016  are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other postemployment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in note 11  to the consolidated financial statements  



the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yieldcurve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve beginning in 2016 abbvie also reflected the plans specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2018  a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019  and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2018  



the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2018  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019  a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2019  by 62 million  

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2018  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019  a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum 



loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements  for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent   consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period at december 31 2018  a 50 basis point   increasedecrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreasedincreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately   160 million  additionally at december 31 2018  a five percentage point   increasedecrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increaseddecreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately   420 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  



the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 10 billion  at december 31 2018  if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts however gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies 

in november 2016 the company issued €36 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information related to the senior euro note issuance and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information related to the net investment hedging program 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 403 million  at december 31 2018  if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 24 billion  at december 31 2018  a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 

market price risk 

abbvie’s debt securities investment portfolio the portfolio is its main exposure to market price risk the portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors it is abbvie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity abbvie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately 16 million  as of december 31 2018  if the portfolio were to be liquidated the fair value reduction would affect the statement of earnings in the period sold

disclosure controls and procedures internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the chief executive officer richard a gonzalez and the chief financial officer robert a michael evaluated the effectiveness of abbvies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that abbvies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information abbvie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by abbvie in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to abbvies management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2018  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payers physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2017  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42  of abbvies 2017  gross revenues in the united states outside the united states sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors depending on the market served these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business no material portion of abbvies 



business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with other available hcv treatment options the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products as are significant investments in marketing distribution and sales organization activities which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other followon versions of small molecule products this added complexity is due to steps needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such as humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies the law also requires that the biosimilar must be for a condition of use approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty 

in the european union while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005 the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products with significant variation by product 

other competitive products although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since humira was first introduced in 2003 most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are 



often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the public health service act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2018 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica those related to ombitasvirparitaprevirritonavir and dasabuvir which are sold under the trademarks viekira pak viekirax exviera and holkira pak those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir which are sold under the trademarks mavyret and maviret and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states 



composition of matter patents covering ombitasvir paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in 2032 2031 and 2029 respectively the united states composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

licensing and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures these licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees milestone payments and royalty andor profit sharing obligations see note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements —other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements  included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development product distribution analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5   licensing acquisitions and other arrangements —other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements  included under item 8   financial statements and supplementary data  

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand 

research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 





 the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

abbvie spent approximately 50 billion  in 2017  44 billion  in 2016  and 43 billion  in 2015  on research to discover and develop new products indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel license fees consulting payments contract research clinical drug supply manufacturing the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities clinical trial costs and collaboration fees and expenses 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials or patient registries or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency ema after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 



the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payers and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under 



medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 50 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2018  at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbvie is subject to a corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may 7 2012 that requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program and contains reporting obligations including disclosure of financial payments to doctors if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united 



states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2017  were approximately 17 million  and operating expenditures were approximately 28 million  in 2018  capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately 3 million  and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 30 million  

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 29000  persons as of january 31 2018 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 



  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to abbvies business and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 



risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1   business —intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3   legal proceedings  the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 184 billion  in 2017  expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira 

  abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes  review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

  a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction 



preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

  any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 65 of abbvies total net revenues in 2017  any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

  abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

  a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with roche holding ag to develop and commercialize a nextgeneration bcl2 inhibitor venclexta venetoclax for patients with relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and abbvie is investigating its efficacy for additional indications 

failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 



  biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvie’s biologic products as competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

  new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis c treatment options these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease oncology and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

  the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 



  abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

  significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

  abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

  abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing 



changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

  abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1   business —regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalties andor other sanctions including exclusion from federal health care programs if it fails to comply with the terms of the may 7 2012 resolution of the department of justices investigation into sales and marketing activities for depakote 

on may 7 2012 abbott settled united states federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act agreeing to pay 



approximately 700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately 900 million to resolve civil claims and submitting to a term of probation the term of probation ended january 1 2016 upon abbvie satisfying all of the probation conditions however if abbvie violates any remaining terms of the plea agreement it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate 

in addition abbott entered into a fiveyear cia with the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services oig the effective date of the cia is october 11 2012 the obligations of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the cia requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from abbvies board of directors among other requirements compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on abbvie including in the form of employee training third party reviews compliance monitoring reporting obligations and management attention if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the oig may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of abbotts costs 

  the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states make up approximately 35  of abbvies total net revenues in 2017  the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

 events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

  if abbvie does not effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica abbvies revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected 

abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sales ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient for imbruvica and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers imbruvica to abbvies customers the commercialization of 



imbruvica may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indications the relative price of imbruvica as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to the label for imbruvica that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of imbruvica is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with pharmacyclics will be adversely affected 

  abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

  abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2017  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states  if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

  abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 



  abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy or breakdown data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may cause sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging to abbvie its patients customers or business partners to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business 

  other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

  abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5   market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

  an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 



in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

  certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

results of operations 

net revenues 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

other nonoperating expenses 



interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the may 2016 issuance of 78 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan 



interest expense in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due to a full year of expense associated with the may 2015 issuance of 167 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics in addition to the incremental expense associated with the may 2016 senior notes issuance discussed above interest expense in 2016 also included a debt extinguishment charge of 39 million  related to the redemption of the 175 senior notes that were due to mature in november 2017 these increases were partially offset by the absence of bridge financingrelated costs of 86 million  in 2015 incurred in connection with the acquisition of pharmacyclics interest income continued to increase in both 2017 and 2016 due to growth in the company’s investment securities 

net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included 316 million  of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of us tax reform net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling 298 million related to the devaluation of abbvie’s net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the venezuelan devaluation net foreign exchange loss in 2015 included losses of 170 million to complete the liquidation of the company’s remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with shire

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate was 31  in 2017  24  in 2016  and 23  in 2015  the effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the united states tax incentives in puerto rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities the increase in the effective tax rate for 2017  over the prior year was principally due to the estimated tax effects of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” in 2017 the effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of 45 billion on the onetime mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries partially offset by a 36 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the act and foreign tax law changes 

the act significantly changed the us corporate tax system the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and creates a territorial tax system that includes new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as a result the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the act

cash dividend payments totaled 41 billion  in 2017  37 billion  in 2016  and 33 billion  in 2015  the increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate on october 27 2017  abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the companys quarterly cash dividend from 064  per share to 071  per share beginning with the dividend payable on february 15 2018  to stockholders of record as of january 12 2018  this reflects an increase of approximately 11  over the previous quarterly rate on february 15 2018 abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the companys quarterly cash dividend from 071  per share to 096  per share beginning with the dividend payable on may 15 2018 to stockholders of record as of april 13 2018 the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends by abbvie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors   

in addition to the asrs under abbvies existing stock repurchase program the company repurchased approximately 13 million  shares for 10 billion  in 2017  approximately 34 million  shares for 21 billion  in 2016  and approximately 46 million  shares for 28 billion  in 2015   abbvie cashsettled 285 million  of its december 2016 open market purchases in january 2017 and cashsettled 300 million  of its december 2015 open market purchases in january 2016 the stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of abbvie shares from time to time in openmarket or private transactions at managements 



discretion the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time abbvies remaining stock repurchase authorization was 40 billion  as of december 31 2017  on february 15 2018 abbvies board of directors authorized a new 100 billion  stock repurchase program which superseded abbvies previous stock repurchase program the new stock repurchase program permits purchases of abbvie shares from time to time in openmarket or private transactions including accelerated share repurchases at management’s discretion the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time 

in 2017 abbvie paid 305 million  of contingent consideration to bi related to a phase 3 enrollment milestone 268 million  of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and 37 million  was included in operating cash flows 

cash and equivalents were impacted by net favorable exchange rate changes totaling 29 million  in 2017  net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling 338 million  in 2016  and 300 million  in 2015  the favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the companys eurodenominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of abbvies net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the companys eurodenominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies 

prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 a significant portion of cash and equivalents were considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries the enactment of us tax reform significantly changed the us corporate tax system including imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the creation of a territorial tax system that generally allows the repatriation of future foreign sourced earnings without incurring additional us taxes the company has not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax the provisional estimate of the onetime transition tax was 45 billion and is generally payable in eight annual installments abbvie does not expect the transition tax liability to materially affect its liquidity and capital resources 

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected abbvie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables 

abbvie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece portugal italy and spain which have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions substantially all of abbvies trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with government health systems outstanding governmental receivables in these countries net of allowances for doubtful accounts totaled 255 million  as of december 31 2017  and 244 million  at december 31 2016  the company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oilexporting countries that have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions including saudi arabia and russia which may result in delays in the collection of receivables outstanding governmental receivables related to saudi arabia net of allowances for doubtful accounts were 149 million  as of december 31 2017  and 122 million  as of december 31 2016  outstanding governmental receivables related to russia net of allowances for doubtful accounts were 152 million as of december 31 2017  and 110 million as of december 31 2016  global economic conditions and customerspecific factors may require the company to periodically reevaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses 

currently abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in oilexporting countries will have a significant impact on the companys liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility however if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31 2017  

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

abbvie currently has a 30 billion   five year revolving credit facility which matures in october 2019 the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2017  the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2017  and 2016  



access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

there were no changes in the company’s credit ratings in 2017 unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 



contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  



 abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

rebates   

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold rebates and chargebacks totaled 129 billion  in 2017  108 billion  in 2016  and 86 billion  in 2015  rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 92  of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2017  remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 





cash discounts and product returns 

cash discounts and product returns which totaled 13 billion  in 2017  964 million  in 2016  and 898 million  in 2015  are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other postemployment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11  to the consolidated financial statements  

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yield curve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve beginning in 2016 abbvie also reflected the plans specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2017  a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018  and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2017  



effective december 31 2015 abbvie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs historically abbvie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period in late 2015 abbvie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows abbvie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates abbvie accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle this change reduced abbvie’s net periodic benefit cost by approximately 41 million  in 2016  this change had no  effect on the 2015 expense and did not affect the measurement of abbvie’s total benefit obligations 

the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2017  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018  a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2018  by 54 million  

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of 



december 31 2017  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018  a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements  for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the 



estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of a company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent   consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period at december 31 2017  a 50 basis point  increasedecrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreasedincreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 170 million  additionally at december 31 2017  a five percentage point increasedecrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increaseddecreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 390 million

the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  



the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 10 billion  at december 31 2017  if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts however gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies 

in november 2016 the company issued €36 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information related to the senior euro note issuance and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information related to the net investment hedging program 

the functional currency of the company’s venezuela operations is the us dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy during the first quarter of 2016 in consideration of declining economic conditions in venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate abbvie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar vef were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 vef per us dollar but rather at the divisa complementaria dicom rate therefore during the first quarter of 2016 abbvie recorded a charge of 298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivardenominated net monetary assets using the dicom rate then in effect of approximately 270 vef per us dollar as of december 31 2017  abbvie’s net monetary assets in venezuela were insignificant 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 509 million  at december 31 2017  if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 22 billion  at december 31 2017  a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 



market price risk 

abbvie’s debt securities investment portfolio the portfolio is its main exposure to market price risk the portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors it is abbvie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity abbvie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately 34 million  as of december 31 2017  if the portfolio were to be liquidated the fair value reduction would affect the income statement in the period sold 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbvie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was 48 million  as of december 31 2017  and 42 million  as of december 31 2016  abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs in 2017  and 2016  impairment charges recorded were insignificant in 2015 abbvie recorded impairment charges totaling 36 million  related to certain of the companys investments in nonpublicly traded equity securities

disclosure controls and procedures internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the chief executive officer richard a gonzalez and the chief financial officer william j chase evaluated the effectiveness of abbvies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that abbvies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information abbvie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by abbvie in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to abbvies management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2017  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payors physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 



abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2016  three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 41 of abbvies 2016  gross revenues in the united states outside the united states sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors depending on the market served these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with other available hepatitis c treatment options the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection new products or treatments brought to market by abbvie’s competitors could cause revenues for abbvie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases 

biosimilars competition for abbvie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as “biosimilars” for example the fda has approved a biosimilar of humira in the united states and final approval of a biosimilar of humira in the eu is imminent biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products as are significant investments in marketing distribution and sales organization activities which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other followon versions of small molecule products this added complexity is due to steps needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such as humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies the law also requires that the biosimilar must be for a condition of use approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or 



switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty 

in the european union while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005 the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products with significant variation by product 

other competitive products although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since humira was first introduced in 2003 most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a “patent term restoration” for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years biological products licensed under the public health service act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 



abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2017 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie’s business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica those related to ombitasvirparitaprevirritonavir and dasabuvir which are sold under the trademarks viekira pak viekirax exviera and holkira pak and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states composition of matter patents covering ombitasvir paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in 2032 2031 and 2029 respectively 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvie’s employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

licensing and other arrangements 

in addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products abbvie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements strategic alliances copromotion arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements and joint ventures these licensing and other arrangements typically include among other terms and conditions nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone payments see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on abbvie’s licensing and other agreements 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source for example the filling and packaging of humira syringes to be sold outside of the united states and puerto rico is performed by a single supplier at its two different facilities abbvie does not currently believe that this agreement is material because abbvies business is not substantially at risk without access to these facilities abbvie maintains significant inventory of humira syringes to reduce the risk of any supply disruption and its own syringefilling and packaging facility in the united states is approved to supply syringes to primary markets outside of the united states and puerto rico in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand 



research and development activities 

abbvie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team abbvie also partners with third parties such as biotechnology companies other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance abbvie’s existing portfolio 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

 the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

abbvie spent approximately 44 billion in 2016  43 billion in 2015  and 33 billion in 2014  on research to discover and develop new products indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel license fees consulting payments contract research clinical drug supply manufacturing the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities clinical trial costs and collaboration fees and expenses 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials or patient registries or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 



outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products 



directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs in addition abbvie provides a discount of 50 for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2017 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbvie is subject to a corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may 7 2012 that requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program and contains reporting obligations including disclosure of financial payments to doctors if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 



most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital expenditures for pollution control in 2016  were approximately 5 million and operating expenditures were 28 million in 2017  capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be 15 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately 30 million 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 30000 persons as of january 31 2017 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 



  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to abbvies business and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the 



risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 161 billion in 2016  expired in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira 

  abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes  review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 



  a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

  any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 63 of abbvies total net revenues in 2016  any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the approval of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

  abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

  a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with roche holding ag to develop and commercialize a nextgeneration bcl2 inhibitor venclexta venetoclax for patients with relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and abbvie is investigating its efficacy for additional indications 



failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 

  biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvies biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvie’s biologic products for example the fda has approved a biosimilar of humira in the united states and final approval of a biosimilar of humira in the eu is imminent and boehringer ingelheim’s marketing authorization application to the ema and its application to the united states fda have been accepted for review as competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie’s biologic products abbvie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

  new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with antitnf products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and abbvie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis c treatment options these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease oncology and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvie’s products and this could negatively impact abbvie’s business and results of operations 

  the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of 



products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

  abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

  significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

  abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

  abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 



will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

  abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations

  the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states make up approximately 38 of abbvies total net revenues in 2016  the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

 events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 



  abbvies ability to realize the anticipated benefits of its merger with pharmacyclics will depend on its ability to effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica® ibrutinib

  abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

  abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2016  three wholesale distributors—amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation—accounted for substantially all of abbvies net revenues in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

  abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any 



desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

  abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy or breakdown data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may cause sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging to abbvie its patients customers or business partners to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business 

  other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

  abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

  an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their 



abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

  certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate was 24 in 2016  23 in 2015  and 25 in 2014  the effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the united states tax exemptions and incentives in puerto rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions business development activities and the cost of repatriation decisions the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016  over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as well as certain discrete factors and events including acquisitions and collaborations the effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of 187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the internal revenue service on december 7 2016 that changed the determination of the us taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations the effective income tax rate in 2015  included a tax benefit of 103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances the effective income tax rate in 2014  included state valuation allowances of 129 million and additional expenses of 129 million related to the branded prescription drug fee which is nondeductible 



financial position liquidity and capital resources

in 2016  and 2015  the company issued and redeemed commercial paper the balance of commercial paper outstanding was 377 million as of december 31 2016  and 400 million as of december 31 2015  abbvie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed in november 2016 the company issued €36 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes the company used the proceeds to redeem 40 billion aggregate principal amount of 175  senior notes due to mature in november 2017 in connection with the offering abbvie incurred 17 million of issuance costs in may 2016 the company issued 78 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes approximately 20 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in november 2016 approximately 19 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of stemcentrx and approximately 38 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an asr see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the asr transactions in connection with the may 2016 issuance of senior notes abbvie incurred 52 million of issuance costs 

in may 2015 the company issued 167 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes approximately 115 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and 50 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an asr in 2015  the company paid 86 million of costs relating to an 180 billion 364day bridge term loan credit agreement the bridge loan as well as 93 million of costs relating to the may 2015 issuance of senior notes no amounts were drawn under the bridge loan which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes in september 2015 abbvie entered into a threeyear 20 billion term loan credit facility and a 364day 20 billion term loan credit facility in november 2015 abbvie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its 40 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015 

cash dividend payments totaled 37 billion in 2016  and 33 billion in 2015  the increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate on october 28 2016 abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the companys quarterly cash dividend from 057 per share to 064 per share beginning with the 



dividend payable on february 15 2017 to stockholders of record as of january 13 2017 this reflects an increase of approximately 12 over the previous quarterly rate the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors 

in addition to the asrs the company repurchased approximately 34 million shares for 21 billion in the open market in 2016  and approximately 46 million shares for 28 billion in the open market in 2015  purchases of abbvie shares under this program may be made from time to time at managements discretion the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time abbvies remaining stock repurchase authorization was 36 million as of december 31 2016 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the asr on february 16 2017 abbvies board of directors authorized a 50 billion increase to abbvies existing stock repurchase program the stock repurchase authorization permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions has no time limit and may be discontinued at any time 

cash and equivalents were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling 338 million in 2016  and 300 million in 2015  the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of abbvies net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the companys eurodenominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2016  are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the united states abbvie would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2016  has been reinvested indefinitely 

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables 

abbvie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece portugal italy and spain that have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions substantially all of abbvies trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with government health systems outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries totaled 244 million as of december 31 2016  and 525 million at december 31 2015  the company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oilexporting countries which have recently experienced a deterioration in economic conditions including saudi arabia and russia outstanding net governmental receivables were 122 million related to saudi arabia and 110 million related to russia as of december 31 2016  due to oil market conditions in recent years liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables global economic conditions and customerspecific factors may require the company to periodically reevaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses 

currently abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in oilexporting countries will have a significant impact on the companys liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility however if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31 2016  



credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

abbvie currently has a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility which matures in october 2019 the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2016 the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

on april 28 2016 following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of stemcentrx sp global ratings sp lowered abbvie’s corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating to “a” from “a” abbvie’s “a1” shortterm rating remained unchanged sp revised its ratings outlook to “stable” from “negative” on june 1 2016 moody’s investor service downgraded abbvie’s senior unsecured longterm rating to baa2 from baa1 and affirmed abbvie’s prime2 shortterm rating there were no additional changes in the company’s credit ratings in 2016 

unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  







 abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold rebates and chargebacks totaled 108 billion in 2016  86 billion in 2015  and 59 billion in 2014  rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and 



records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 90 of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2016  remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



cash discounts and product returns 

allowances for cash discounts and product returns which totaled 964 million in 2016  898 million in 2015  and 610 million in 2014  are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 



the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yield curve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve beginning in 2016 abbvie also reflected the plans specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2016  a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017  and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2016  



effective december 31 2015 abbvie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs historically abbvie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period in late 2015 abbvie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows abbvie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates abbvie has accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle this change reduced abbvie’s net periodic benefit cost by approximately 41 million in 2016 this change had no effect on the 2015 expense and will not affect the measurement of abbvie’s total benefit obligations 

the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2016  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017  a one percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2017  by 49 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2016  and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017  a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017  and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement 



carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written off iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of a company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

contingent   consideration 

the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs including discount rates the probabilities of achieving the milestones the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations in any given period at december 31 2016  a 50 basis point increasedecrease in the assumed discount 



rate would have decreasedincreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 180 million  additionally at december 31 2016  a five percentage point increasedecrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increaseddecreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately 360 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen and british pound the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  



the company estimates that a 10 appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 854 million at december 31 2016  if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts which would be offset by gains on the underlying hedged items a 10 appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 

in november 2016 the company issued €36 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes which are exposed to foreign currency risk the company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates as a result any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the senior euro note issuance and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program 

the functional currency of the company’s venezuela operations is the us dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy at december 31 2015 there were three legal exchange mechanisms administered by the venezuelan government these were the official rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars vef per us dollar the supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency sicad rate of approximately 135 vef per us dollar and the foreign exchange marginal system simadi rate of approximately 200 effective march 10 2016 the venezuelan government devalued the official rate of 63 to 10 vef per us dollar eliminated the sicad rate and replaced simadi with a new exchange mechanism divisa complementaria dicom as of december 31 2016  the dicom rate was approximately 673 vef per us dollar 



during the first quarter of 2016 in consideration of declining economic conditions in venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate abbvie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 vef per us dollar but rather at the dicom rate therefore during the first quarter of 2016 abbvie recorded a charge of 298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivardenominated net monetary assets using the dicom rate then in effect of approximately 270 vef per us dollar as of december 31 2016  abbvie’s net monetary assets in venezuela were insignificant 

interest rate risk 

the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of abbvies interest rate swap contracts by approximately 649 million at december 31 2016  if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 23 billion at december 31 2016  a 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 

market price risk 

abbvie’s debt securities investment portfolio the portfolio is its main exposure to market price risk the portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors it is abbvie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity abbvie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings the company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately 33 million as of december 31 2016  if the portfolio were to be liquidated the fair value reduction would affect the income statement in the period sold 

abbvie also holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are traded on public stock exchanges a hypothetical 20 decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value of these investments by 15 million as of december 31 2016  a 20 decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in share prices 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbvie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was 42 million as of december 31 2016  and 33 million as of december 31 2015  abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs in 2016  impairment charges recorded were insignificant in 2015  abbvie recorded impairment charges totaling 36 million related to certain of the companys investments in nonpublicly traded equity securities

disclosure controls and procedures internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the chief executive officer richard a gonzalez and the chief financial officer william j chase evaluated the effectiveness of abbvies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that abbvies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information abbvie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by abbvie in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to abbvies management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2016  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting management of abbvie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 abbvies internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states however all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting 

management assessed the effectiveness of abbvies internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  2013 framework based on that assessment management concluded that abbvie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  based on the coso criteria 

the effectiveness of abbvies internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their attestation report below which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of abbvies internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016

research and development activities 

abbvie has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety tolerability and potential dosing • phase 2—tests the drugs efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients • phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

abbvie spent approximately 43 billion in 2015 33 billion in 2014 and 29 billion in 2013 on research to discover and develop new products indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel license fees consulting payments contract research clinical drug supply manufacturing the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities clinical trial costs and collaboration fees and expenses 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents filed on or after june 8 1995 is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application for a compound to the submission of the nda 

 

for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fdas reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed three and 14 years respectively these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products and in the european union it has also reduced the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2016 to the late 2030s in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvies business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the companys business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent 

 

european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 in the united states noncomposition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica those related to ombitasvirparitaprevirritonavir and dasabuvir which are sold under the trademarks viekira pak viekirax exviera and holkira pak and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united states composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027 the united states composition of matter patents covering ombitasvir paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in 2032 2031 and 2029 respectively 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvies employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payors physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses although abbvies business does not have significant seasonality abbvies product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2015 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 43 percent of abbvies 2015 gross revenues in the united states outside the united states sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors depending on the market served these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

 

orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source for example the filling and packaging of humira syringes to be sold outside of the united states and puerto rico is performed by a single supplier at its two different facilities abbvie does not currently believe that this agreement is material because abbvies business is not substantially at risk without access to these facilities abbvie maintains significant inventory of humira syringes to reduce the risk of any supply disruption and its own syringefilling and packaging facility in the united states is approved to supply syringes to primary markets outside of the united states and puerto rico in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 5 licensing acquisitions and other arrangements—other licensing  acquisitions activity of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and has certain agreements with abbott as discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—transition from abbott and cost to operate as an independent company 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of abbvie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for forecasted sales 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2015 were approximately 5 million and 23 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2016 are estimated to be approximately 2 million and 25 million respectively 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable 

 

laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf and other products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection 

biosimilars competition for abbvies biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products as are significant investments in marketing distribution and sales organization activities which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other followon versions of small molecule products this added complexity is due to steps needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such as humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity potency and in vitro characterization the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies the law also requires that the biosimilar must be for a condition of use approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent 

furthermore the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning will likely be subject to substantial uncertainty for years to come 

 

in the european union while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005 the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products with significant variation by product 

other competitive products although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since humira was first introduced in 2003 most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the fda before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in three sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trials or patient registries or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and controls any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the united states abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united states for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the nonjapanese clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed 

 

market such as the united states or europe before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required such as risk management plans 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have recently been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

in march 2010 congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act under the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs also in 2011 abbvie began providing a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2016 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbvie is subject to a corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may 7 2012 that requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program and contains reporting obligations including disclosure of financial payments to doctors if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 

 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 28000 persons as of january 31 2016 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors   tableend 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to abbvies business risks related to abbvies separation from abbott and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

  the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately 140 billion in 2015 is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in october 2018 because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira 

  abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that 

 

the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed in addition petitioners have filed and may continue to file challenges to the validity of abbvie patents under the 2011 leahysmith america invents act which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the united states patent and trademark office 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation administrative proceedings and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced 

  a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

  any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 61 percent of abbvies total net revenues in 2015 any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the approval of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

  abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical 

 

industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

  a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with biogen to develop a treatment for the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis it is also collaborating with roche holding ag to discover develop and commercialize a nextgeneration bcl2 inhibitor abt199 venetoclax for patients with relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia 

failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration 

  biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in 

 

large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvies biologic products may become subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvies biologic products for example amgen has submitted a marketing authorization application to the european medicines agency for a biosimilar of humira and the united states fda has accepted for review amgens application for a humira biosimilar if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvies biologic products abbvies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

  new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease oncology dyslipidemia and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvies products and this could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other 

 

batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

  abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

  significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

  abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured 

 

  abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures the potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

  abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged 

 

violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

  abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalties andor other sanctions including exclusion from federal health care programs if it fails to comply with the terms of the may 7 2012 resolution of the department of justices investigation into sales and marketing activities for depakote 

on may 7 2012 abbott settled united states federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act agreeing to pay approximately 700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately 900 million to resolve civil claims and submitting to a term of probation the term of probation ended january 1 2016 upon abbvie satisfying all of the probation conditions however if abbvie violates any remaining terms of the plea agreement it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate 

in addition abbott entered into a fiveyear cia with the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services oig the effective date of the cia is october 11 2012 the obligations of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the cia requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from abbvies board of directors among other requirements compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on abbvie including in the form of employee training third party reviews compliance monitoring reporting obligations and management attention if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the oig may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of abbotts costs 

  the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets net revenues outside of the united states make up approximately 41 percent of abbvies total net revenues in 2015 the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs  

• multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvies ability to manufacture market and sell its products • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain nonus countries including in europe and latin america and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

  abbvies ability to realize the anticipated benefits of its merger with pharmacyclics will depend on its ability to effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica® ibrutinib 

the anticipated benefits of abbvies merger with pharmacyclics will depend on abbvies ability to effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica including abbvies ability to create and meet continued market demand achieve market acceptance and generate product sales ensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredient for imbruvica and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensure that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers imbruvica to abbvies customers the commercialization of imbruvica may not be successful due to among other things unexpected challenges from competitors new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indications the relative price of imbruvica as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to the label for imbruvica that further restrict its marketing if the commercialization of imbruvica is unsuccessful abbvies ability to generate revenue from product sales and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will be adversely affected 

  abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported 

 

results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

  abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2015 three wholesale distributors—amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation—accounted for substantially all of abbvies net revenues in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

  abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent abbvie incurs additional indebtedness these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

  abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

  abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy or breakdown although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business 

 

  other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pension and postemployment benefits stockbased compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbvies equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbvie or its employee benefit trusts • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology accounting human resources payroll and other outsourced services to abbvie to meet their contractual obligations to abbvie and • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups risks related to abbvies common stock 

  abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

  an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such 

 

designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

  certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

• the inability of abbvies stockholders to call a special meeting • the division of abbvies board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause • the ability of abbvies directors and not stockholders to fill vacancies on abbvies board of directors and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 percent of abbvies voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvies amended and restated bylaws relating to the number term and election of abbvies directors the filling of board vacancies the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

results of operations 

net revenues 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another

cash and equivalents in 2015 and 2014 were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling 300 million and 577 million respectively principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the companys eurodenominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies in 2014 abbvie had an increased concentration of cash denominated in foreign currencies accumulated in anticipation of the terminated proposed combination with shire while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2015 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the united states abbvie would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2015 has been reinvested indefinitely 

credit risk 

abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring 

 

arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables 

abbvie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including greece portugal italy and spain that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions substantially all of abbvies trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with governmental health systems abbvie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in southern europe as heightened economic concerns still exist outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december 31 2015 and 2014 were as follows 



the company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oilexporting countries which have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions including venezuela and saudi arabia outstanding net governmental receivables related to saudi arabia were 108 million as of december 31 2015 refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency risk for additional disclosures related to venezuela due to the decline in the price of oil liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables global economic conditions and customerspecific factors may require the company to reevaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses 

currently abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in southern europe and oilexporting countries will have a material impact on the companys liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility however if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31 2015 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

abbvie currently has a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility which matures in october 2019 the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants at december 31 2015 the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were not material there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2015 and 2014 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company 

 

believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

on april 7 2015 following the announcement of the then proposed combination with pharmacyclics moodys investor service confirmed its baa1 senior unsecured longterm rating and prime2 shortterm rating and revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable on march 5 2015 standard  poors rating services sp affirmed abbvies a corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating and its a1 commercial paper rating and revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable there were no additional changes in the companys credit ratings in 2015 

unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 



a includes estimated future interest payments on longterm debt securities and capital lease obligations interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2015 projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2015 refer to notes 9 and 10 for further discussion regarding the companys debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at december 31 2015 annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material b includes the companys significant unconditional purchase obligations these commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business c amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of 150 million abbvie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to december 31 2015 amounts otherwise exclude pension and other postemployment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables also included in this amount are components of other longterm liabilities including restructuring refer to notes 8 and 11 for further information 

abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting 

 

period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers state government medicaid programs insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities 

rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold rebates and chargebacks totaled 86 billion 59 billion and 49 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant 

in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends rebate programs and contract terms legislative changes or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate historically adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 90 percent of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks charged against 

 

revenues in 2015 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



cash discounts and product returns 

allowances for cash discounts and product returns which totaled 898 million 610 million and 748 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the companys experience of payment history is fairly consistent product returns can be reliably estimated based on the companys historical return experience 

pension and other postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the yield curve approach reflects the plans specific cash flows ie duration in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve beginning in 2016 abbvie will also reflect the plans specific cash flows and apply them to the specific spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans as of december 31 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016 a 50 basis 

 

point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2015 



effective december 31 2015 abbvie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the abbvie pension plan and its primary other postemployment benefit plan in the united states as well as certain international defined benefit plans and other postemployment benefit plans based on current economic conditions this change is expected to reduce abbvies net periodic benefit cost by approximately 41 million in 2016 as a result of this change refer to note 11 for further information regarding this change 

the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016 a 1 percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2016 by 45 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016 a 1 percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015 



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as various claims legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability intellectual property commercial securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 14 for further information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of a company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 interest—imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  the amendments in asu 201503 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts this standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 with early adoption permitted on a retrospective basis abbvie elected to early adopt this new standard effective in the three months ended june 30 2015 as a result abbvie reclassified approximately 7 million and 27 million of net deferred financing costs as of december 31 2014 that were previously classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets and other longterm assets respectively to longterm debt and lease obligations current and noncurrent total debt issuance costs classified as a reduction of longterm debt and lease obligations current and noncurrent were 117 million as of december 31 2015

the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures refer to note 10 entitled financial instruments and fair value measures of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro japanese yen and british pound various abbvie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in abbvies consolidated balance sheets deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party generally not exceeding twelve months at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbvie held 15 billion and 14 billion respectively in notional amounts of such contracts 

abbvie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans the contracts which are not designated as hedges are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange on abbvies consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbvie held notional amounts of 68 billion and 68 billion respectively of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014 



the company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 822 million at december 31 2015 if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts which would be offset by gains on the underlying hedged items a 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 

 

the functional currency of the companys venezuela operations is the us dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars vef for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms to three rates of exchange as of december 31 2015 these were the official rate of 63 the supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency sicad rate of approximately 135 and the foreign exchange marginal system simadi rate of approximately 200 in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 the company used the official rate of 63 vef per us dollar and reported 317 million of net monetary assets and 210 million of net revenues denominated in the venezuelan bolivar 

on february 17 2016 the venezuelan government announced that it plans to devalue the official rate of 63 to 10 vef to us dollars and eliminate the sicad rate of 135 vef to us dollars the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar will result in a charge to abbvies results of operations in the first quarter of 2016 if abbvies net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar had been converted at a rate of 10 vef to us dollars at december 31 2015 the company would have reported a devaluation loss of 117 million in 2015 if abbvies net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar had been converted at the simadi rate of 200 at december 31 2015 the company would have reported a devaluation loss of 307 million in 2015 

the company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether the use of the official rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances which could result in a significant charge to abbvies results of operations at that time 

interest rate risk 

interest rate swaps are used to manage the companys exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixedrate debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate at december 31 2015 and 2014 abbvie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 110 billion and 80 billion respectively the company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100basis points would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately 464 million at december 31 2015 if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 19 billion at december 31 2015 a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 

market price sensitive investments 

abbvie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are traded on public stock exchanges the fair value of these investments was approximately 111 million and 82 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in value occurs a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value of these investments by 22 million at december 31 2015 a 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in share prices 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbvie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 33 million and 63 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs in 2015 abbvie recorded impairment charges totaling 36 million related to certain of the companys investments in nonpublicly traded equity securities

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting managements report on internal control over financial reporting is included on page 105 hereof the report of abbvies independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included on page 106 hereof 

changes in internal control over financial reporting as part of its separation from abbott in 2014 abbvie began a phased global implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system related technology infrastructure and transaction processing services to replace the information technology infrastructure and transactional services provided to abbvie by abbott under various transition services agreements these initiatives which were completed in 2015 included modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting abbvie reviewed these controls for design effectiveness prior to the implementation of each phase 

there were no other changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2015 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

research and development activities 

abbvie has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex lifethreatening diseases abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety tolerability and potential dosing • phase 2—tests the drugs efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients • phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agencies outside the united states the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase 4 trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

abbvie spent approximately 33 billion in 2014 29 billion in 2013 and 28 billion in 2012 on research to discover and develop new products indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel license fees consulting payments contract research clinical drug supply manufacturing the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities clinical trial costs and collaboration fees and expenses 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents filed on or after june 8 1995 is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities varies both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fdas reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed three and 14 years respectively these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity as discussed above the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products and in the european union it has also reduced the effect of biosimilars on sales 

of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2015 to 2035 in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvies business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the companys business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in april 2018 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to lopinavirritonavir which is sold under the trademarks kaletra and aluvia those related to ombitasvirparitaprevirritonavir and dasabuvir which are sold under the trademarks viekira pak viekirax exviera and holkira pak and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavir is expected to expire in 2016 a principal united states noncomposition of matter patent covering lopinavirritonavir is expected to expire in 2016 the united states composition of matter patents covering ombitasvir paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in 2032 2031 and 2029 respectively the principal united states noncomposition of matter patent covering androgel 1 percent is expected to expire in 2021 including pediatric exclusivity agreements that may affect exclusivity are discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvies employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

marketing sales and distribution capabilities 

abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payors physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

in 2014 abbvies products were sold in over 170 countries abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty 

pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses although there are no significant seasonal aspects to abbvies business abbvies product sales may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2014 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42 percent of abbvies 2014 gross sales in the united states outside the united states sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors depending on the market served these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source for example the filling and packaging of humira syringes to be sold outside of the united states and puerto rico is performed by a single supplier at its two different facilities abbvie does not currently believe that this agreement is material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent upon it abbvie maintains significant inventory of humira syringes to reduce the risk of any supply disruption and its own syringefilling and packaging facility in the united states is approved to supply syringes to primary markets outside of the united states and puerto rico in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements as discussed in note 6 acquisitions collaborations and other arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and has certain agreements with abbott as discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—transition from abbott and cost to operate as an independent company 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world including in the united states in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of our products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for forecasted sales 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2014 were approximately 3 million and 26 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2015 are estimated to be approximately 4 million and 28 million respectively 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf and other products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection 

biosimilars competition for abbvies biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products as are significant investments in marketing distribution and sales organization activities which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other followon versions of small molecule products this added complexity is due to steps needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such as humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no 

clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity potency and in vitro characterization the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies the law also requires that the biosimilar must be for an indication approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent 

furthermore the new law provides that only a biosimilar product that is deemed to be interchangeable will be considered by the fda to be substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the new law is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning will likely be subject to substantial uncertainty for years to come 

in the european union while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005 the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products with significant variation by product 

other competitive products although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since humira was first introduced in 2003 most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and obtain fda approval before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in three sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural substantive and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulations outside the united states abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda 

approval for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the foreign clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceuticals manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceuticals manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have recently been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting end stage renal disease treatment is covered through a bundled payment that likewise creates incentives for providers to demand lower pharmaceutical prices medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

in march 2010 congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act under the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs also in 2011 abbvie began providing a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting 

requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2015 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbvie is subject to a corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may 7 2012 that requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program and contains reporting obligations including disclosure of financial payments to doctors if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in 

currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 26000 persons as of january 31 2015 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations financial condition or cash flows the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to abbvies business risks related to abbvies separation from abbott and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business results of operations financial condition or cash flows in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies 

competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest selling product and had worldwide net sales of approximately 125 billion in 2014 is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in april 2018 because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira 

abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating earnings 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira accounted for approximately 63 percent of abbvies total net sales in 2014 any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the approval of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results of operations 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with biogen idec to develop a treatment for the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis it is also collaborating with 

roche holding ag to discover develop and commercialize a nextgeneration bcl2 inhibitor abt199 for patients with relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia 

failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration 

biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvies biologic products may become subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvies biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvies biologic products abbvies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virologyliver disease renal disease dyslipidemia and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors 

of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvies products and this could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase 4 trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures recently enacted changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of 

private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalties andor other sanctions including exclusion from federal health care programs if it fails to comply with the terms of the may 7 2012 resolution of the department of justices investigation into sales and marketing activities for depakote 

on may 7 2012 abbott settled united states federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act and agreeing to pay approximately 700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately 900 million to resolve civil claims under the plea agreement abbott submitted to a term of probation that was initially set at 5 years but was shortened to 3 years upon the separation of abbott and abbvie the obligations of the plea agreement have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the conditions of probation include certain reporting requirements maintenance of certain 

compliance measures certifications of abbvies ceo and board of directors and other conditions if abbvie violates the terms of its probation it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate on october 2 2012 the court accepted the guilty plea and imposed the agreedupon sentence 

in addition abbott entered into a fiveyear cia with the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services oig the effective date of the cia is october 11 2012 the obligations of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the cia requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from abbvies board of directors among other requirements compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on abbvie including in the form of employee training third party reviews compliance monitoring reporting obligations and management attention if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the oig may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of abbotts costs 

the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets sales outside of the united states make up approximately 46 percent of abbvies total net sales in 2014 the risks associated with abbvies operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvies ability to manufacture market and sell its products • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain nonus countries including in europe and latin america and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2014 three wholesale distributors—amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation—accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent that abbvie incurs additional indebtedness these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy or breakdown although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies profitability and financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pension and postemployment benefits stockbased compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbvies equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbvie or its employee benefit trusts and • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups risks related to abbvies separation from abbott 

abbvies historical financial information for fiscal year 2012 and prior periods is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 

the historical information about abbvie in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 and for the periods ending prior to december 31 2012 refers to abbvies business as operated by and integrated with abbott abbvies historical financial information for these periods was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of abbott accordingly the financial information for these periods does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that abbvie would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that abbvie will achieve in the future 

for additional information about the past financial performance of abbvies business and the basis of presentation of the financial statements of abbvies business see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

as abbvie builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems abbvie could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions 

abbvie is installing and implementing information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions including accounting and reporting manufacturing process control customer service inventory control and distribution abbvie may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from abbotts existing transactional and operational systems data centers and the transition services that support these functions as abbvie replaces these systems abbvie may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated abbvies failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces abbotts information technology services or its failure to implement the new systems and replace abbotts services successfully could disrupt its business adversely affect its ability to collect receivables from customers and have a material adverse effect on its profitability in addition if abbvie is unable to replicate or transition certain systems its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired 

abbott may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation or abbvie may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including transition services agreements a tax sharing agreement international commercial operations agreements finished goods supply agreements contract manufacturing agreements an employee matters agreement a special products master agreement an information technology agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after abbvies separation from abbott abbvie relies on abbott to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if abbott is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations abbvie could incur operational difficulties or losses 

in addition abbvie and abbott entered into longterm arrangements under a special products master agreement relating to certain product rights and into an exus transition services agreement for abbott to provide abbvie with back office functions and other services in certain markets outside the united states until abbvie has established sufficient back office infrastructure to conduct operations in such markets these arrangements could lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbvies rights to certain intellectual property and territorial commercialization rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for abbvies products and operations outside of the united states 

if abbvie does not have in place its own systems and services or if abbvie does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction or longterm agreements terminate abbvie may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline abbvie is in the process of creating its own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services abbott currently provides to it abbvie may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from abbotts systems to abbvies these systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services abbott is expected to provide during the transition period 

abbvie is developing and implementing its own back office functions administrative systems personnel and processes for markets outside the united states where abbott will initially provide such functions there can be no assurance that abbvie will be able to fully implement such functions effectively and without disrupting its business in those markets 

potential indemnification liabilities to abbott pursuant to the separation agreement could materially adversely affect abbvie 

the separation agreement with abbott provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between abbvie and abbott with respect to and resulting from the separation among other things the separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities except certain tax liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation agreement including those relating to depakote if abbvie is required to indemnify abbott under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement abbvie may be subject to substantial liabilities 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future 

an abbvie stockholders percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future a stockholders percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

• the inability of abbvies stockholders to call a special meeting • the division of abbvies board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause • the ability of abbvies directors and not stockholders to fill vacancies on abbvies board of directors and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 percent of abbvies voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvies amended and restated bylaws relating to the number term and election of abbvies directors the filling of board vacancies the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

financial results 

since becoming an independent company abbvies strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results and returns for shareholders while ensuring a strong sustainable growth business over the longer term in 2014 abbvie grew worldwide net sales by 6 percent to 200 billion driven primarily by the continued strength of humira and doubledigit sales growth from other key products including creon duodopa and synthroid sales growth in 2014 continued to reflect the impact of the loss of exclusivity in the companys lipid franchise which resulted in the loss of 748 million of revenue in 2014 over the prior year generic competition began in november 2012 for tricor july 2013 for trilipix and september 2013 for niaspan 

the companys financial performance in 2014 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of 110 including aftertax transaction and financingrelated costs totaling 18 billion incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with shire plc shire a 750 million aftertax charge related to a research and development collaboration agreement with calico life sciences llc calico and a 173 million aftertax charge as a result of entering into a global collaboration with infinity pharmaceuticals inc infinity refer to note 4 for further information regarding the termination of the companys proposed combination with shire and note 6 for further information regarding the companys collaborations with calico and infinity abbvies financial performance in 2014 also reflected an improvement in gross margin primarily due to favorable product mix across the product portfolio and operational efficiencies as well as increased funding in support of abbvies emerging midand latestage pipeline assets and additional humira indications 

in 2014 the company generated cash flows from operations of 35 billion net of the aftertax transaction and financingrelated costs incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with shire these strong cash flows enabled the company to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities pay cash dividends to shareholders of 27 billion and repurchase approximately 9 million shares for 550 million in addition the board of directors declared an increase in the companys quarterly cash dividend from 042 per share to 049 per share of common stock payable in february 2015 as well as authorized a new 50 billion stock repurchase program that is expected to be executed over the next several years 

in addition to these financial results abbvie continued to advance its pipeline during 2014 including securing regulatory approval in the united states for abbvies interferonfree hcv treatment viekira pak as well as submitting its regulatory application in the european union which was subsequently approved in january 2015 abbvie also continued to advance its previously submitted regulatory applications in the united states for duopa which were subsequently approved in january 2015 and completed several latestage clinical trials including zinbryta daclizumab for the treatment of the relapsingremitting form of multiple sclerosis ms and registrational programs for an expanded use of humira for hidradenitis suppurativa abbvie also augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities including inlicensing duvelisib a dual acting pi3 kinase inhibitor currently under investigation for use in a variety of hematological malignancies from infinity and entering into a novel collaboration with calico to discover develop and commercialize new therapies for patients with agerelated diseases 

2015 strategic objectives 

in 2015 abbvie expects sales performance to be driven by continued strong growth from humira the launch of viekira pak and sales growth in certain key products including creon and duodopa partially offset by a decline in several products due to generic competition including androgel 1 and the remainder of the lipid franchise in addition abbvie expects to achieve operating margin improvements while continuing to invest in its pipeline in support of opportunities in oncology hcv and immunology as well as continued investment in key products abbvie expects to grow operating cash flows in 2015 which will enable the company to continue to augment its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing acquisition and partnering activity and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases 

abbvie expects to continue to drive strong humira sales growth in several ways abbvie seeks to expand the humira patient base by applying for regulatory approval of new indications for humira treating conditions such as uveitis and hidradenitis suppurativa abbvie will also seek to drive humira sales growth by expanding its market share and its presence in underserved markets abbvie plans to continue making investments in key emerging markets including brazil china and russia 

another key driver of abbvies performance in 2015 will be viekira pak which is now approved in the united states the european union and a number of other countries around the world abbvie expects to support the successful launch of viekira in the united states by securing payor positions and patient access and focusing commercial efforts on penetration in abbvieexclusive and parity accounts the company has launched viekirax in several european countries including germany the united kingdom and canada and continues to work with various governments around the world to gain reimbursements approvals 

abbvie will continue its investment in products with historically stable sales levels while making adjustments as necessary to increase the value of its product portfolio abbvie plans to achieve this objective in a variety of ways depending on product and circumstances by for example identifying supply chain efficiencies pursuing additional indications and optimizing residual value as products reach the end of exclusivity abbvie believes that its approach will allow the company to maintain a strong operating margin 

rd efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology virologyliver disease oncology renal disease neurological diseases and womens health abbvies scientists work to advance a pipeline of specialty molecules that demonstrate strong clinical performance for patients and economic value for patients and their healthcare systems current rd projects are described in the research and development section below abbvie will also continue to augment its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing acquisition and partnering activity in 2015

other 

given the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included rd expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbvies total rd expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbvies overall market position there were no delays in abbvies 2014 rd activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbvies ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances the nature and extent of costsharing arrangements and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development 

separation from abbott laboratories and basis of historical presentation 

abbvie was incorporated in delaware on april 10 2012 on january 1 2013 abbvie became an independent publiclytraded company as a result of the distribution by abbott laboratories abbott of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of abbvie to abbotts shareholders 

prior to the separation the historical financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from abbotts consolidated financial statements and accounting records as if the former researchbased pharmaceutical business of abbott had been part of abbvie for all periods presented accordingly abbvies financial statements for periods prior to january 1 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect abbvies financial position results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of abbott prior to the separation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states the combined financial statements principally represent the historical results of operations and assets and liabilities of abbotts former researchbased pharmaceutical business 

for periods prior to january 1 2013 the historical combined financial statements also reflected an allocation of expenses related to certain abbott corporate functions including senior management legal human resources finance information technology and quality assurance these expenses were allocated to abbvie based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues headcount square footage number of transactions or other measures abbvie considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable however the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had abbvie operated as an independent standalone publiclytraded company for the periods presented accordingly the historical financial information presented for periods prior to january 1 2013 may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial position that would have been achieved if abbvie had been an independent standalone publiclytraded company during the periods shown or of abbvies performance for periods subsequent to december 31 2012 

results of operations 

net sales 

the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 



sales growth in 2014 and 2013 was driven by the continued strength of humira both in the united states and internationally as well as sales growth in key products including synthroid creon and duodopa sales increased in 2014 and 2013 despite the loss of exclusivity for abbvies consolidated lipid franchise as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates generic competition began in november 2012 for tricor in july 2013 for trilipix and in september 2013 for niaspan 

the following table details the sales of key products 



on a constant currency basis global humira sales increased 19 percent in 2014 and 15 percent in 2013 primarily as a result of market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies approval of new indications higher market share and favorable pricing in certain geographies abbvie is pursuing several new indications to help further differentiate humira from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of humira 

androgel sales decreased 10 percent in both 2014 and 2013 primarily due to a decline in the overall us testosterone replacement market the company expects this trend will continue androgel sales for 2013 were impacted by rebates implemented during the second half of 2012 certain account losses in early

interest expense net of 391 million in 2014 278 million in 2013 and 84 million in 2012 was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt in november 2012 abbvie issued 147 billion of longterm debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and entered into interest rate swaps with various financial institutions which converted 80 billion of its fixed rate interest rate debt to floating interest rate debt commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 416 million 400 million and 10 billion respectively 

interest expense net in 2014 also included 141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with shire and in 2012 bridge facility fees related to the separation from abbott 

other income net 

other income net includes income from the resolution of certain contractual agreements fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and impairments of equity securities other income net in 2014 primarily consisted of income of 34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate was 25 percent in 2014 23 percent in 2013 and 8 percent in 2012 the effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the allocation of the companys taxable earnings among jurisdictions as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year including acquisitions and collaborations the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2014 was principally driven by state valuation allowances of 129 million and additional expenses of 129 million related to the branded prescription drug fee which is nondeductible the increase in the effective tax rate in 2013 over 2012 is principally due to income tax expense related to certain 2013 earnings outside the united states that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested as well as the absence of 195 million of tax benefits recorded in 2012 as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year 

transition from abbott and cost to operate as an independent company 

abbvie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions incremental information technologyrelated costs and incremental costs to operate a standalone back office infrastructure outside the united states 

abbvies transition services agreements with abbott in the united states cover certain corporate support services that abbvie has historically received from abbott such services include information technology accounts payable payroll and other financial functions as well as engineering support for various facilities 

quality assurance support and other administrative services the terms of the services under the agreements vary by activity these agreements facilitate the separation by allowing abbvie to operate independently prior to establishing standalone back office functions across its organization 

as of the date of the separation abbvie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the united states as a result abbvie entered into transition services agreements with abbott to provide services outside the united states including back office services in certain countries for up to three years after separation these back office services include information technology accounts payable payroll receivables collection treasury and other financial functions as well as order entry warehousing and other administrative services these transition services agreements have allowed abbvie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to establishing a standalone back office infrastructure for all countries during the transition from abbott abbvie has and will continue to incur nonrecurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure in addition in certain international markets as of the date of the separation and as of december 31 2014 certain marketing authorizations to sell abbvies products continued to be held by abbott until such authorizations could be transferred through the applicable regulatory channels 

it is not practicable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred in each of the periods presented in the historical financial statements for the functions described above actual costs that would have been incurred if abbvie operated as a standalone company during these periods would have depended on various factors including organizational design outsourcing and other strategic decisions related to corporate functions information technology and international back office infrastructure refer to note 1 entitled background and basis of presentation of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further description of transactions between abbvie and abbott 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 



cash flows provided by operations in 2014 was 35 billion compared to 63 billion in 2013 the decrease was primarily due to aftertax transaction and financingrelated and other costs of 18 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with shire including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions the decrease was also due to the timing of us wholesaler collections and an investment in inventory in preparation for the launch of abbvies interferonfree hcv combination in the united states starting in middecember 2014 and in the european union in january 2015 the decrease was also due to an increase in abbvies voluntary contribution to its main domestic defined benefit pension plan which was 370 million in 2014 and 145 million in 2013 abbvie also made a voluntary contribution of 150 million to this plan subsequent to december 31 2014 

in 2014 cash outflows related to collaborations acquisitions and other arrangements totaled 622 million including 275 million paid to infinity related to a global collaboration to develop duvelisib ipi145 and 250 million to fund a novel rd collaboration with calico abbvie accrued an additional 500 million payment to calico in 2014 due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the rd collaboration which was subsequently paid in 2015 in 2013 cash outflows related to collaborations acquisitions and other arrangements totaled 405 million including 175 million related to the global collaboration with ablynx nv and 70 million related to a global collaboration with alvine cash flows from investing activities 

in 2014 also reflected capital expenditures including the purchase of a small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in singapore and net sales purchases of shortterm investments 

in 2014 and 2013 the company issued and redeemed commercial paper the balance of commercial paper outstanding was 416 million and 400 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively abbvie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed 

cash dividend payments totaled 27 billion in 2014 and 26 billion in 2013 on october 20 2014 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 049 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on january 15 2015 payable on february 13 2015 the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of abbvies board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors 

in february 2013 abbvies board of directors authorized a 15 billion common stock repurchase program which was effective immediately in october 2014 abbvies board of directors authorized a new 50 billion stock repurchase program which was effective immediately and superseded the prior authorization under these programs the company repurchased approximately 9 million shares for 550 million in the open market in 2014 and approximately 4 million shares for 223 million in the open market in 2013 purchases of abbvie shares may be made from time to time at managements discretion the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time abbvies remaining share repurchase authorization was 47 billion as of december 31 2014 

cash and equivalents in 2014 was also impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling 577 million principally due to the impact of the substantial weakening of the euro in 2014 on the translation of the companys eurodenominated assets and the weakening of foreign currencies in combination with an increased concentration of cash denominated in foreign currencies accumulated in anticipation of the terminated proposed combination with shire while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2014 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the united states abbvie would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2014 has been reinvested indefinitely 

substantially all of abbvies trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with governmental health systems abbvie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in southern europe as heightened economic concerns still exist outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december 31 2014 and 2013 were as follows 



abbvie monitors economic conditions the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding both domestically and abroad abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables currently abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in southern europe will have a material impact on the companys liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility however if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31 2014 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

prior to october 2014 abbvie was party to a 20 billion unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders which also supported commercial paper borrowings the credit facility enabled the company to borrow funds at floating interest rates in october 2014 abbvie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility the new revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants 

at december 31 2014 the company was in compliance with its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the credit facility were not material there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

on july 18 2014 following the announcement of the proposed combination with shire moodys investor service affirmed its baa1 senior unsecured longterm rating and prime2 shortterm rating and revised its ratings outlook to stable from positive in addition standard  poors ratings services sp placed its a corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating on abbvie on creditwatch with negative implications on october 21 2014 sp affirmed abbvies a corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating and removed the negative credit watch sp affirmed its a1 commercial paper rating and did not place it on creditwatch there were no other changes in the companys credit ratings in 2014 

unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 



a accounts payable and accrued liabilities includes a 500 million accrual for a payment to calico due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the rd collaboration which was paid in the first quarter of 2015 b includes estimated future interest payments on longterm debt securities and capital lease obligations interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2014 projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2014 refer to notes 9 and 10 for further discussion regarding the companys debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at december 31 2014 annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material c includes the companys significant unconditional purchase obligations these commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business d amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of 150 million abbvie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to december 31 2014 amounts otherwise exclude pension and other postemployment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables also included in this amount are components of other longterm liabilities including restructuring refer to notes 8 and 11 for further information 

abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of which products have been sold subject to the rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply for that rebate and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate using historical trends for that rebate adjusted for current changes abbvie estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbvie records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale abbvie regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 

rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded in the same period as the related sales and are reflected as a reduction of sales rebates and chargebacks in 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 59 billion 49 billion and 43 billion respectively or 29 percent 30 percent and 28 percent respectively of the gross sales subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related annual gross sales would decrease net sales by 201 million in 2014 abbvie considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances for cash discounts and returns charged against gross sales were 610 million 748 million and 667 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the united states the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates managed care rebates and wholesaler chargebacks medicaid rebates relate to the federal medicaid program which is administered by state agencies whereby rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities under various laws and regulations and in some cases supplemental rebates are also provided to the states under contractual agreements medicare rebates are negotiated with managed care organizations that manage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit pharmacy benefit manager rebates arise from contractual agreements with private health care plans that seek to reduce costs by negotiating discounts with pharmaceuticals manufacturers under wholesaler chargeback programs the wholesaler charges abbvie back for the difference between the price paid by the wholesaler to abbvie and the price paid by the end customer to the wholesaler under contractual discount agreements negotiated between abbvie and the end customer in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances 

for each type of rebate management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for that rebate external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the rebate percentage or net price systems and calculations are used to track sales by product and by customer or payer and to estimate the contractual or statutory rebate or net price abbvie believes its systems and calculations are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 82 percent of the total consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2014 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbvie employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

cash discounts and returns 

cash discounts can be reliably estimated product returns can be reliably estimated because abbvies historical returns are low and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

pension and postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the discount rate is the single rate that equates the discounted cash flows to the rates utilizing the yield curve as a result the yieldcurve 

approach reflects the specific cash flows for plans ie duration in calculating the discount rate for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and postemployment plans as of december 31 2014 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015 a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2015 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2014 



the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2014 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015 as of december 31 2014 a 1 percentage point change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2015 by 42 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2014 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015 a 1 percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2015 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 14 for further information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected there were no significant litigation reserves at december 31 2014 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

annually the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the companys share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie tests indefinitelived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test 

for its quantitative impairment tests the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of a company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization totaled 74 billion and 82 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets was 403 million 509 million and 625 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively there were no impairments of goodwill in 2014 2013 or 

2012 in 2014 abbvie recorded an impairment charge of 37 million related to certain onmarket product rights in japan due to increased generic competition the charge was included in cost of products sold in 2012 abbvie recorded impairment charges of 13 million for certain projects under development these charges were included in rd expense there were no impairment charges recorded in 2013 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 summary and amendments that create revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 and other assets and deferred costs—contracts with customers subtopic 34040  the amendments in asu 201409 supersede most current revenue recognition requirements the core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted abbvie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods i retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or ii retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application abbvie is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures refer to note 10 entitled financial instruments and fair value measures of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro british pound and japanese yen various abbvie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in abbvies consolidated balance sheets deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party generally not exceeding twelve months at december 31 2014 and 2013 abbvie held 14 billion and 15 billion respectively in notional amounts of such contracts 

abbvie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans the contracts which are not designated as hedges are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange on abbvies consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2014 and 2013 abbvie held notional amounts of 68 billion and 53 billion respectively of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 



the company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 790 million at december 31 2014 if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contacts a 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 

the company estimates that a 10 percent depreciation of abbvies most significant foreign currency positions against the us dollar would cause a foreign exchange loss on cash and shortterm investments of 611 million at december 31 2014 a 10 percent depreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in these currencies 

the companys venezuelan operations continue to report with the us dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require abbvie to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government effective february 8 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 43 to 63 which resulted in a loss of 11 million in 2013 that was recorded in net foreign exchange loss on the consolidated statement of earnings 

in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms to three rates of exchange as of december 31 2014 these were the cencoex rate of 63 the official rate the sicad i rate at approximately 12 and the sicad ii rate at approximately 50 in february 2015 the venezuelan government confirmed the official exchange rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar will be used for settlement of food and medicine purchases the company continues to use the official rate of 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar to report its venezuela financial position results of operations and cash flows since the company believes that the nature of abbvies business operations qualify for the official rate as permitted by law the company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether the use of the official rate of 63 will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances if circumstances change such that the company concludes it would be appropriate to use a different rate or if a devaluation of the official rate occurs it could result in a significant change to abbvies results of operations at december 31 2014 abbvie had approximately 240 million of net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar converted at a rate of 63 vefusd in its venezuelan entity which had net sales of 240 million in 2014 if abbvies net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar had been converted at a rate of 12 vefusd at december 31 2014 it would have resulted in a devaluation loss of 114 million in 2014 

interest rate risk 

interest rate swaps are used to manage the companys exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixedrate debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate abbvie does not use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities at both december 31 2014 and 2013 abbvie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 80 billion the company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100basis points would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately 348 million at december 31 2014 if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 758 million at december 31 2014 a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 

market price sensitive investments 

abbvie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are traded on public stock exchanges the fair value of these investments was approximately 82 million and 49 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would have had an immaterial decrease to their fair value at december 31 2014 a 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in share prices 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbvie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 63 million and 58 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs

disclosure controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the chief executive officer richard a gonzalez and the chief financial officer william j chase evaluated the effectiveness of abbvies disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that abbvies disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information abbvie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by abbvie in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to abbvies management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

internal control over financial reporting 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting managements report on internal control over financial reporting is included on page 103 hereof the report of abbvies independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included on page 104 hereof 

changes in internal control over financial reporting as part of its separation from abbott abbvie began a phased global implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system related technology infrastructure and transaction processing services to replace the information technology infrastructure and transactional services provided to abbvie by abbott under various transition services agreements these initiatives which are expected to be completed in 2015 will include modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting abbvie reviews these controls for design effectiveness prior to the implementation of each phase 

there were no other changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

zemplar zemplar is a product sold worldwide for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with stage 3 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease ckd 

research and development activities 

abbvie has numerous compounds in clinical development including potential treatments for complex diseases over the past five years abbvie has more than doubled the number of compounds in its pipeline through a mix of internal development and external collaboration efforts abbvies ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the companys use of integrated discovery and development project teams which include chemists biologists physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team 

the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases 

• phase i—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety tolerability and potential dosing • phase ii—tests the drugs efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients • phase iii—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the us food and drug administration fda or similar government 

agencies outside the us the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 

the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee when or if a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 

in addition to the development of new products and new formulations research and development projects also may include phase iv trials sometimes called postmarketing studies for such projects clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameters the benefits and risks of an approved drug 

abbvie spent approximately 29 billion in 2013 28 billion in 2012 and 26 billion in 2011 on research to discover and develop new products indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel license fees consulting payments contract research manufacturing the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities and collaboration fees and expenses 

intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity 

generally upon approval products in development may be entitled to exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes abbvie seeks patent protection where available in all significant markets andor countries for each product in development in the united states the expiration date for patents filed on or after june 8 1995 is 20 years after the filing date given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application for a compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus 100 percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years 

pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirements for each of these exclusivities varies both in the united states and in other jurisdictions in the united states if the fda approves a product that does not contain a previously approved active ingredient the product is typically entitled to five years of market exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of market exclusivity if approval was based on the fdas reliance on new clinical studies submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity 

applicable laws and regulations dictate the market exclusivity to which the product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country in certain instances regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required 

to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed three and 14 years respectively these estimates do not consider other factors such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other followon product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods 

biologics such as humira are entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 dayextension term for conducting pediatric studies the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar the european union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of followon biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products and it has also reduced the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products 

abbvie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications abbvie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families each of which includes united states patent applications andor issued patents and may also contain the nonunited states counterparts to these patents and applications 

these patents and applications including various patents that expire during the period 2014 to 2031 in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvies business however abbvie believes that no single patent license trademark or related group of patents licenses or trademarks except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the companys business as a whole the united states composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in april 2018 

in addition the following patents licenses and trademarks are significant those related to lopinavirritonavir which is sold under the trademarks kaletra and aluvia and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united states composition of matter patent covering lopinavir is expected to expire in 2016 a principal united states noncomposition of matter patent covering lopinavirritonavir is expected to expire in 2016 the principal united states noncomposition of matter patent covering androgel 1 percent is expected to expire in 2021 including pediatric exclusivity the principal united states noncomposition of matter patents covering androgel 162 percent are expected to expire in 2020 and 2026 agreements that may affect exclusivity are discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations 

abbvie may rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect its technology however trade secrets are difficult to protect abbvie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators these agreements may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition abbvies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors to the extent that abbvies employees consultants advisors contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions 

sales marketing and distribution capabilities 

in 2013 abbvies products were sold in over 170 countries abbvie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources regional commercial resources and distributorships to market sell and distribute its products worldwide 

in the united states abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients in 2013 three wholesale distributors mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states no individual wholesaler accounts for greater than 40 percent of abbvies 2013 gross sales in the united states these wholesalers purchase product from abbvie under standard terms and conditions of sale 

abbvie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription or recommendation of its brand of products by physicians key opinion leaders and other health care providers managed care providers for example health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers hospitals and state and federal government agencies for example the united states department of veterans affairs and the united states department of defense are also important customers abbvie also markets directly to consumers themselves although in the united states all of the companys products must be sold pursuant to a prescription outside of the united states abbvie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders payors physicians and country regulatory bodies abbvie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products 

abbvies products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers distributors government agencies health care facilities specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvieowned distribution centers and public warehouses outside the united states sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors depending on the market served approximately 5560 percent of sales outside the united states are made through wholesalers or distributors no wholesaler or distributor outside the united states accounts for more than 3 percent of abbvies sales certain products are comarketed or copromoted with other companies abbvie has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on the companys business 

no material portion of abbvies business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

third party agreements 

abbvie has agreements with third parties for process development analytical services and manufacturing of certain products abbvie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supply source for example the filling and packaging of humira syringes to be sold outside of the united states and puerto rico is performed by a single supplier at its two different facilities abbvie does not currently believe that this agreement is material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent upon it abbvie maintains significant inventory of humira syringes to reduce the risk of any supply disruption and its own syringefilling and packaging facility in the united states is now approved to supply syringes to primary markets outside of the united states and puerto rico it was previously approved to provide product only to the united states and puerto rico in addition abbvie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development services fill finish and packaging services and distribution and logistics services for certain products abbvie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because abbvies business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most cases abbvie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption 

abbvie also has collaboration agreements as discussed in note 5 acquisitions collaborations and other arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements and has certain agreements with abbott 

sources and availability of raw materials 

abbvie purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world including in the united states in addition certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of our products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers abbvie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages 

orders 

orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvies business 

environmental matters 

abbvie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations abbvies capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2013 were approximately 2 million and 20 million respectively capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2014 are estimated to be approximately 2 million and 21 million respectively 

abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the united states including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund some of these locations were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie has become a party to these investigations and remediations abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agencies while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities abbvie believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position cash flows or results of operations 

competition 

the markets for abbvies products are highly competitive abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf and other products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments the search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition the introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence price is also a competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on abbvies products that do not have patent protection 

biosimilars competition for abbvies biologic products is affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars biologics have added major therapeutic options for the 

treatment of many diseases including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medications and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products as are significant investments in marketing distribution and sales organization activities which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors 

in the united states the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations while the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march 2010 was meant to provide a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act recent regulatory guidance suggests that the approval process for biosimilars will be far more extensive than the approval process for generic or other followon versions of small molecule products in order to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such as humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency the types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity would include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies and clinical studies applicable regulations also require that the biosimilar must be for the same indication as the original biologic and involve the same mechanism of action and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent 

furthermore the new law provides that only a biosimilar product that is deemed to be interchangeable may be substituted for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the new law is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning will likely be subject to substantial uncertainty for years to come 

in the european union while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005 the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products with significant variation by product 

other competitive products although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since humira was first introduced in 2003 most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market in addition the first jak inhibitor part of a new class of orally administered products was recently approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis in the us abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and orally administered products 

regulation—discovery and clinical development 

united states securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete the applicant must complete preclinical tests and obtain fda approval before commencing clinical trials clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are 

conducted in three sequential phases although the phases may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the results are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications the fda reviews an nda or bla to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 

even if an nda or a bla receives approval the applicant must comply with postapproval requirements for example holders of an approval must report adverse reactions provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling also quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural substantive and record keeping requirements in addition as a condition of approval the fda may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety or efficacy after commercialization any postapproval regulatory obligations and the cost of complying with such obligations could expand in the future 

outside the united states abbvie is subject to similar regulations outside the united states abbvie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product the approval requirements and process vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval for example abbvie may submit marketing authorizations in the european union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states under the centralized procedure a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicines agency after the agency evaluates the application it makes a recommendation to the european commission which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 

in japan applications for approval of a new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda bridging studies to demonstrate that the foreign clinical data applies to japanese patients may be required after completing a comprehensive review the pmda reports to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application 

the regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve many emerging markets including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market such as the united states before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country 

the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary in addition postapproval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after a marketing authorization has been granted in the european union periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented 

regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing 

the manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvies products are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agencies both in the united states and other countries addresses among other matters inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and 

reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices abbvies operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials and require safeguards for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback and false claims laws in the united states prescription drug manufacturers such as abbvie are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees 

compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects abbvies business among other effects health care regulations substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products abbvie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties 

in addition to regulatory initiatives abbvies business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others these studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products in some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitations on marketing of such products domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 

access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries a major focus is cost containment efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures abbvie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products outside the united states many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitations or compulsory licensing budgetary pressures in the united states and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on abbvies products for the foreseeable future 

united states specifically us federal laws require pharmaceuticals manufacturers to pay certain statutorilyprescribed rebates to state medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state medicaid plans and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect abbvies business similarly the veterans health care act of 1992 as a prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care programs requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies including the united states department of veterans affairs department of defense and public health service entities and institutions in addition recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to tricare program beneficiaries the veterans health care act of 1992 also established the 340b drug discount program which requires pharmaceuticals manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities 

in the united states most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows a diagnosisrelated group 

drg payment system for certain institutional services provided under medicare or medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system pps for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings drg and pps entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products medicare reimburses part b drugs based on average sales price asp plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs which have recently been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting end stage renal disease treatment is covered through a bundled payment that likewise creates incentives for providers to demand lower pharmaceutical prices medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patientadministered medicine delivered under part d 

in march 2010 congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act under the affordable care act abbvie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs also in 2011 abbvie began providing a discount of 50 percent for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole 

the affordable care act also includes provisions known as the physician payments sunshine act which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the centers for medicare and medicaid services for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the united states and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties 

abbvie expects debate to continue during 2014 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services abbvie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above 

abbvie is subject to a corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may 7 2012 that requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program and contains reporting obligations including disclosure of financial payments to doctors if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 

european union the european union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the european union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations european governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers as a result patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european countries the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing in recent years many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products 

most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturers generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances in addition governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems 

japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains a drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare sets the prices of the products on this list the government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products new products judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population diseases however may be eligible for a pricing premium the government has also promoted the use of generics where available 

emerging markets many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals 

since abbvie markets its products worldwide certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the united states including price and currency exchange controls changes in currency exchange rates limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action 

employees 

abbvie employed approximately 25000 persons as of january 31 2014 outside the united states some of abbvies employees are represented by unions or works councils abbvie believes that it has good relations with its employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating abbvie and abbvies common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect abbvies results of operations or financial condition the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to abbvies business risks related to abbvies separation from abbott and risks related to abbvies common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties abbvie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently believes to be immaterial may also 

adversely affect its business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

  if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business financial condition or results of operations in such case the trading price of abbvies common stock could decline 

risks related to abbvies business 

the expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating income 

abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of its products in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvies marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and most major markets outside of the united states patents covering abbvie products normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvies products 

as patents for certain of its products expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time if abbvies competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations in addition proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposals that are enacted into law could worsen the effect of generic competition 

abbvies principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in item 1 business—intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations and litigation regarding these patents is described in item 3 legal proceedings the united states composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvies largest selling product and had worldwide sales of approximately 107 billion in 2013 is expected to expire in december 2016 and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union countries in april 2018 because humira is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of humira 

abbvies major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvies future revenues and operating income 

third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvies patents and patent applications for example manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug applications andas with the united states food and drug administration fda seeking to market generic forms of abbvies products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed 

although most of the challenges to abbvies intellectual property have come from other businesses governments may also challenge intellectual property rights for example court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents such as legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain governments outside the united states have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies such as hivaids if triggered compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents including by filing patent infringement lawsuits patent litigation and other challenges to abbvies patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for a patented product to the extent abbvies intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvies business will suffer to the extent that countries do not enforce abbvies intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of abbvies intellectual property abbvies future revenues and operating income will be reduced 

a third partys intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on abbvies future profitability and financial condition 

third parties may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreements abbvie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or products any of these events could have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

any significant event that adversely affects humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on abbvies results of operations and cash flows 

humira generates approximately 57 percent of abbvies sales any significant event that adversely affects humiras revenues could have a material adverse impact on abbvies operations and cash flows these events could include loss of patent protection for humira the approval of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason 

abbvies research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new products and new indications andor brand extensions for existing products and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful for example in 2012 abbvie discontinued the development of abt263 which was in phase ii development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies a high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant funds have been invested products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concerns superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies failure to achieve positive clinical or preclinical outcomes beyond the current standard of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more 

detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect abbvies future results 

even if abbvie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences changing industry standards or competitors innovations abbvies innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement abbvie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause abbvies products to become obsolete causing abbvies revenues and operating results to suffer 

a portion of abbvies nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products 

abbvie depends on alliances with pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its nearterm pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with biogen idec to develop a treatment for the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis it is also collaborating with galapagos nv to discover develop and commercialize a nextgeneration oral janus kinase 1 jak1 inhibitor in phase ii development with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases 

failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to abbvie or any disruption in the relationships between abbvie and these third parties could have an adverse effect on abbvies pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvies collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of abbvie and its collaboration partners including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration 

biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on future results of operations 

the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological materials such as cell lines may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products manufacturing biologics especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics cannot be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics—including humira—could adversely impact abbvies business and results of operations 

new products and technological advances by abbvies competitors may negatively affect abbvies results of operations 

abbvie competes with other researchbased pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics for example humira competes with a number of antitnf products that are approved for a number of disease states and abbvies virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other antihiv treatments these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with abbvies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology virology renal disease dyslipidemia and neuroscience abbvie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances such competing products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than abbvies products and this could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvies biologic products may become subject to competition from biosimilars 

the biologics price competition and innovation act was passed on march 23 2010 as title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law created a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united states and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in addition companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with abbvies biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvies biologic products abbvies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of abbvies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired as a result abbvie could face more litigation with respect to the validity andor scope of patents relating to its biologic products 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing abbvies products abbvies business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of abbvies products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities including those intended to support future demand for abbvies products changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements changes in the types of products produced physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply manmade or natural disasters and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers the failure of these singlesource suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair abbvies ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvies business and results of operations finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals abbvie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve abbvies use of such alternatives abbvie does however carry business interruption insurance which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a singlesource supplier 

significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for abbvies products which could have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and financial condition 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies if new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including results of postmarketing phase iv trials or if governments change standards regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a products label or narrow its approved indication either of which could reduce the products market acceptance if serious safety or efficacy issues with an abbvie product arise sales of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authorities safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvies products 

new data about abbvies products or products similar to its products could negatively impact demand for abbvies products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some cases could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of abbvies products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of abbvies products 

abbvie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that abbvies products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers consequences may also include additional costs a decrease in market share for the products lower income and exposure to other claims product liability losses are selfinsured product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on abbvies business and results of operations 

abbvie is subject to costcontainment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

costcontainment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in item 1 business—regulation—commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factors abbvies future revenues and operating income will be reduced in the united states the european union and other countries abbvies business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future 

in the united states practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers and united states federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressures recently enacted changes to the health care system in the united states and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures 

in numerous major markets worldwide the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets abbvie is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in particular many european countries have ongoing governmentmandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in europe differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to thirdparty crossborder trading in abbvies products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating income 

abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 

abbvies products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authorities as described in item 1 business—regulation—discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs 

in addition abbvie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 

possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to abbvies business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of abbvies products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvies or its suppliers facilities while abbvie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt abbvies business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on abbvie require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 

the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement rebates price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united states these laws include antikickback and false claims laws the medicaid rebate statute the veterans health care act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations which could require abbvie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices in addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt abbvies business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 

abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalties andor other sanctions including exclusion from federal health care programs if it fails to comply with the terms of the may 7 2012 resolution of the department of justices investigation into sales and marketing activities for depakote 

on may 7 2012 abbott settled united states federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the food drug  cosmetic act fdca and agreeing to pay approximately 700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately 900 million to resolve civil claims under the plea agreement abbott submitted to a term of probation that was initially set at 5 years but was shortened to 3 years upon the separation of abbott and abbvie the obligations of the plea agreement have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the conditions of probation include certain reporting requirements maintenance of certain compliance measures certifications of abbvies ceo and board of directors and other conditions if abbvie violates the terms of its probation it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate on october 2 2012 the court accepted the guilty plea and imposed the agreedupon sentence 

in addition abbott entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services oig the effective date of the cia is october 11 2012 the obligations of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the cia requires enhancements to abbvies compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from abbvies board of directors among other requirements compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on abbvie including in the form of employee training third party reviews compliance monitoring reporting obligations and management attention if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the oig may impose monetary penalties or exclude abbvie from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of abbotts costs 

the international nature of abbvies business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline 

abbvies business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including in emerging markets sales outside of the united states make up approximately 46 percent of abbvies net sales the risks associated with its operations outside the united states include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 19 

• changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvies ability to manufacture market and sell its products • differing local product preferences and product requirements • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operations • differing labor regulations • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws • political and economic instability including sovereign debt issues • price and currency exchange controls limitations on participation in local enterprises expropriation nationalization and other governmental action • inflation recession and fluctuations in interest rates • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain nonus countries including in europe • compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anticorruption antibribery and other similar laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act events contemplated by these risks may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on abbvies revenues and profitability 

abbvie may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of assets which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability 

abbvie may pursue acquisitions technology licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of some of its assets as part of its business strategy abbvie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities abbvie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets these effects could cause a deterioration of abbvies credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

additionally changes in abbvies structure operations revenues costs or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions divestitures mergers alliances restructurings or other strategic initiatives may result in greater than expected costs may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate 

abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the united states and accordingly its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties 

in 2013 three wholesale distributors—amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation—accounted for substantially all of abbvies sales in the united states if one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvies business and results of operations 

changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

rebates related to government programs such as feeforservice medicaid or medicaid managed care programs arise from laws and regulations abbvie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers various factors including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on abbvies operations 

abbvie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations 

the amount of debt that abbvie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to abbvie and its investors these consequences include among other things requiring a portion of abbvies cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow abbvies business to the extent that abbvie incurs additional indebtedness these risks could increase in addition abbvies cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and abbvie may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance its debt 

abbvie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all and may be dilutive to existing stockholders 

abbvie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes for example it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions abbvie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it if at all if abbvie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms abbvie may be unable to fund its expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect abbvies business if abbvie raises additional funds through the issuance of equity securities its stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if abbvie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect abbvies business 

abbvie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion random attack loss of data privacy or 

breakdown although abbvie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in abbvies information technology systems that could adversely affect abbvies business 

other factors can have a material adverse effect on abbvies profitability and financial condition 

many other factors can affect abbvies profitability and financial condition including 

• changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements product marketing application standards and environmental laws • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value particularly for pensions retiree health care stock compensation intangibles and goodwill and for contingent liabilities such as litigation the absence of a recorded amount or an amount recorded at the minimum compared to the actual amount • changes in the rate of inflation including the cost of raw materials commodities and supplies interest rates market value of abbvies equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts • changes in the commercial and credit environment that may adversely affect abbvies ability to finance its business operations • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to abbvie or its employee benefit trusts and • changes in business economic and political conditions including war political instability terrorist attacks the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action natural disasters the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events labor disputes strikes slowdowns or other forms of labor or union activity and pressure from thirdparty interest groups risks related to abbvies separation from abbott 

abbvies historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 

abbvies separation from abbott was completed on january 1 2013 therefore the historical information about abbvie in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 and for the periods ending prior to december 31 2012 refers to abbvies business as operated by and integrated with abbott abbvies historical financial information for these periods is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of abbott accordingly the financial information for these periods does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that abbvie would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that abbvie will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below 

• prior to the separation which occurred on january 1 2013 abbvies business was operated by abbott as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company abbott or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for abbvie such as accounting information technology and finance abbott currently provides some of these functions to abbvie abbvies historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from abbott for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses abbvie would have incurred had it operated as a separate publicly traded company following the separation and the date on which abbvie ceases to receive services from abbott pursuant to 22 

transition services agreements abbvie may not be able to operate its business at comparable costs and its profitability may decline 

• prior to the separation abbvie was able to use abbotts size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs employees vendor relationships and customer relationships as a separate independent company abbvie may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation which could decrease abbvies overall profitability • generally abbvies working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes including acquisitions research and development and capital expenditures were historically satisfied as part of the corporatewide cash management policies of abbott as a result of the separation abbvie may need to obtain additional financing from banks through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities strategic relationships or other arrangements and • the cost of capital for abbvies business may be higher than abbotts cost of capital prior to the separation for additional information about the past financial performance of abbvies business and the basis of presentation of the financial statements of abbvies business see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

as abbvie builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems abbvie could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions 

abbvie expects to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions including accounting and reporting manufacturing process control customer service inventory control and distribution abbvie may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from abbotts existing transactional and operational systems data centers and the transition services that support these functions as abbvie replaces these systems abbvie may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated abbvies failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces abbotts information technology services or its failure to implement the new systems and replace abbotts services successfully could disrupt its business adversely affect its ability to collect receivables from customers and have a material adverse effect on its profitability in addition if abbvie is unable to replicate or transition certain systems its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired 

abbott may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation or abbvie may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation abbvie and abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including transition services agreements a tax sharing agreement international commercial operations agreements finished goods supply agreements contract manufacturing agreements an employee matters agreement a special products master agreement an information technology agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after abbvies separation from abbott abbvie relies on abbott to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if abbott is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations abbvie could incur operational difficulties or losses 

in addition abbvie and abbott entered into longterm arrangements under a special products master agreement relating to certain product rights and into an exus transition services agreement for abbott to provide abbvie with back office functions and other services in certain markets outside the united states until abbvie has established sufficient back office infrastructure to conduct operations in such markets these arrangements could lead to disputes between abbott and abbvie over abbvies rights to certain intellectual property and territorial commercialization rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for abbvies products and operations outside of the united states 

if abbvie does not have in place its own systems and services or if abbvie does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction or longterm agreements terminate abbvie may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline abbvie is in the process of creating its own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services abbott currently provides to it abbvie may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from abbotts systems to abbvies these systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services abbott is expected to provide during the transition period 

abbvie will be developing and implementing its own back office functions administrative systems personnel and processes for markets outside the united states where abbott will initially provide such functions there can be no assurance that abbvie will be able to implement such functions effectively and without disrupting its business in those markets 

potential indemnification liabilities to abbott pursuant to the separation agreement could materially adversely affect abbvie 

the separation agreement with abbott provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between abbvie and abbott with respect to and resulting from the separation among other things the separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make abbvie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities except certain tax liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after abbvies separation from abbott as well as those obligations of abbott assumed by abbvie pursuant to the separation agreement including those relating to depakote if abbvie is required to indemnify abbott under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement abbvie may be subject to substantial liabilities 

abbvie may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions during the twoyear period following the distribution 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to abbott of the separation and the distribution under the tax sharing agreement that abbvie entered into with abbott abbvie is restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes under the tax sharing agreement for the twoyear period following the distribution abbvie is prohibited except in certain circumstances from 

• entering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 25 percent or more of its stock or substantially all of its assets whether by merger or otherwise • merging consolidating or liquidating • issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds • repurchasing its capital stock and • ceasing to actively conduct its business 24 

these restrictions may limit abbvies ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business in addition under the tax sharing agreement abbvie is required to indemnify abbott against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of abbvies stock or assets even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition 

certain of abbvies executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at abbott 

because of their former positions with abbott certain of these executive officers and directors own abbott common shares options to purchase abbott common shares or other equity awards even though abbvies board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent and abbvies executive officers who were formerly employees of abbott ceased to be employees of abbott some abbvie executive officers and directors continue to have a financial interest in abbott common shares in addition four of abbvies directors currently serve on the board of directors of abbott continuing ownership of abbott common shares and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if abbvie and abbott pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for abbvie and abbott 

abbvie may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation 

abbvie may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from its separation from abbott because among other things a abbvie may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of abbott and b abbvies business is less diversified than abbotts business prior to the separation if abbvie fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed the business financial conditions and results of operations of abbvie could be adversely affected 

risks related to abbvies common stock 

abbvie cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of dividends on its common stock 

although abbvie expects to pay regular cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of abbvies board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant for more information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities abbvies ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets abbvie cannot guarantee that it will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if abbvie commences paying dividends 

your percentage of ownership in abbvie may be diluted in the future 

in the future your percentage ownership in abbvie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions equity awards that abbvie will be granting to abbvies directors officers and employees acquisitions or other purposes abbvies employees will have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their abbott stock options in whole or in part to abbvie stock options abbvie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to its employees such awards will have a dilutive effect on abbvies earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of abbvies common stock 

from time to time abbvie will issue additional options or other stockbased awards to its employees under abbvies employee benefits plans 

in addition abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes abbvie to issue without the approval of abbvies stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over abbvies common stock respecting dividends and distributions as abbvies board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of abbvies common stock for example abbvie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of abbvies directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences abbvie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of abbvie which could decrease the trading price of abbvies common stock 

abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

• the inability of abbvies stockholders to call a special meeting • the division of abbvies board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause • the ability of abbvies directors and not stockholders to fill vacancies on abbvies board of directors and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 percent of abbvies voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in abbvies amended and restated certificate of incorporation and abbvies amended and restated bylaws relating to the number term and election of abbvies directors the filling of board vacancies the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporations outstanding voting stock 

abbvie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with abbvies board of directors and by providing abbvies board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that abbvies board of directors determines is not in the best interests of abbvie and abbvies stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

given the numerous sources for potential future growth no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years factors considered included rd expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbvies total rd expenses as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new 

product on abbvies overall market position there were no delays in abbvies 2013 rd activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 

while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical projects currently in development is expected to be material the total cost to complete will depend upon abbvies ability to successfully complete each project the rate at which each project advances the nature and extent of costsharing arrangements and the ultimate timing for completion given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development however abbvie plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve rd spend equal to approximately 16 percent of net sales each year abbvie does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 

separation from abbott laboratories 

on january 1 2013 abbvie became an independent publiclytraded company as a result of the distribution by abbott laboratories abbott of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of abbvie to abbotts shareholders the separation each abbott shareholder of record as of the close of business on december 12 2012 received one share of abbvie common stock for each abbott common share held as of the record date abbvie was incorporated in delaware on april 10 2012 and is comprised of abbotts former researchbased pharmaceuticals business abbvies common stock began trading regularway under the ticker symbol abbv on the new york stock exchange on january 2 2013 refer to the basis of historical presentation section below for further information 

basis of historical presentation 

prior to the separation the historical financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from abbotts consolidated financial statements and accounting records as if the former researchbased pharmaceutical business of abbott had been part of abbvie for all periods presented accordingly abbvies financial statements for periods prior to january 1 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect abbvies financial position results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of abbott prior to the separation in conformity with gaap in the united states the combined financial statements principally represent the historical results of operations and assets and liabilities of abbotts proprietary pharmaceutical products segment 

the historical combined financial statements included the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at the abbott corporate level but were specifically identifiable or allocable to abbvie prior to 2012 cash and equivalents shortterm investments and restricted funds held by abbott were not allocated to abbvie unless those assets were held by an entity that was transferred to abbvie as of december 31 2012 abbvies combined balance sheet reflected the direct holdings of abbvie legal entities prior to 2012 longterm debt and shortterm borrowings were not allocated to abbvie as none of the debt recorded by abbott was directly attributable to or guaranteed by abbvie in 2012 abbvie issued 147 billion of longterm debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and 10 billion of commercial paper which was reflected on abbvies combined balance sheet as of december 31 2012 

prior to 2012 all intercompany transactions between abbvie and abbott were considered to be effectively settled in the historical combined financial statements at the time the transactions were recorded as a result the total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions was reflected in the combined statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 as a financing activity and in the combined balance sheet at december 31 2012 as net parent company investment in abbvie as of december 31 2012 outstanding transactions between abbvie and abbott 

were reflected in the combined balance sheet outside of net parent company investment in abbvie inc as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate amount due from abbott totaled 738 million and 696 million respectively and was classified in accounts and other receivables net the aggregate amount due to abbott totaled 876 million and 923 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and was classified in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

the historical combined financial statements also reflected an allocation of expenses related to certain abbott corporate functions including senior management legal human resources finance information technology and quality assurance these expenses were allocated to abbvie based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues headcount square footage number of transactions or other measures abbvie considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable however the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had abbvie operated as an independent standalone publiclytraded company for the periods presented 

results of operations 

net sales 



the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior years foreign exchange rates this measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period abbvie believes that the nongaap measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates may provide a more complete understanding of the companys operations and can facilitate analysis of the companys results of operations particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another 

sales growth in 2013 was driven by the continued strength of humira both in the united states and internationally as well as sales of key products including synthroid creon and duodopa sales increased in 2013 despite unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the loss of exclusivity for abbvies consolidated lipid franchise generic competition began in november 2012 for tricor in july 2013 for trilipix and in september of 2013 for niaspan the increase in sales in 2012 was primarily due to higher humira sales partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and the entry of generic competition for tricor in november 2012 

the following table details the sales of key products 



on a constant currency basis global humira sales increased 15 percent in 2013 and 21 percent in 2012 as a result of market expansion and higher market share across various countries higher pricing in certain geographies and the global launch of the ulcerative colitis indication in 2012 humira sales continued to expand in the rheumatology dermatology and gastroenterology categories humira received approvals from the european commission for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in april 2012 the treatment of severe axial spondyloarthritis in july 2012 and the treatment of pediatric patients with severe active crohns disease in november 2012 abbvie is pursuing several new indications to help further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of humira 

androgel sales for 2013 were impacted by rebates implemented during the second half of 2012 certain account losses in early 2013 and continued moderation of market growth the increase in androgel 

sales in 2012 reflected higher prices market share gains the launch of androgel 162 in the second quarter of 2011 and volume growth in the us testosterone replacement market androgel continues to hold the number one market share position in the us testosterone replacement market with approximately 60 percent of the market share androgel 1 sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in late 2014 

global sales of kaletra declined in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of competition 

synthroid sales increased 13 percent and 6 percent in 2013 and 2012 respectively due to strong brand loyalty and market leadership and price 

sales of sevoflurane were impacted in both years by generic competition 

sales of creon in 2013 and 2012 grew by 17 percent and 6 percent respectively creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market and continued to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in 2013 in the first quarter of 2013 the fda approved creon in a 36000 lipaseunit dose for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency creon 36000 is the highest dose of pancreatic therapy currently available 

sales of duodopa abbvies therapy for advanced parkinsons disease currently approved in europe and other international markets increased 16 percent on a constant currency basis duodopa is currently under regulatory review in the united states and a regulatory decision is expected in 2014 

sales for abbvies consolidated lipid franchise which includes tricor trilipix and niaspan declined 50 percent in 2013 and 14 percent in 2012 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the us market and in 2012 softness in the overall branded cholesterol market generic competition began in november 2012 for tricor in july 2013 for trilipix and in september 2013 for niaspan abbvie expects the negative impact of generic competition on sales to continue in 2014 

gross margin 



the gross profit margin in 2013 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio including humira operational efficiencies price increases and lower amortization expense for intangible assets partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates the increase in the gross profit margin in 2012 was primarily due to product mix improved efficiencies higher prices in certain geographies and the favorable impact of foreign currency partially offset by pricing pressures in various other markets the improvement also reflects lower amortization expense for intangible assets and the impact of restructuring programs implemented in 2011 to realign various manufacturing operations 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2013 and 2012 included 228 million and 213 million respectively of costs associated with the separation of abbvie from abbott sga expenses in 2013 included restructuring charges aggregating 39 million which principally related to the restructuring of certain commercial operations in conjunction with the loss and expected loss of exclusivity of certain products sga expenses in 2012 and 2011 included litigation charges of 100 million and 15 billion respectively related to the depakote investigation refer to note 13 for information on the depakote charge 

excluding these items from all years sga expenses increased 9 percent and 7 percent in 2013 and 2012 respectively the increases in sga expenses over the threeyear period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products including continued spending for humira and in 2013 the full year incremental costs of becoming an independent company 

research and development and acquired inprocess research and development 



rd expense in 2013 reflects added funding to support the companys emerging mid and latestage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional humira indications rd expense in 2013 and 2012 reflected continued pipeline spending on programs in biologics neuroscience and virology as well as a 50 million rd milestone payment related to a product in development for the treatment of ckd in 2012 rd expenses also included restructuring charges of 15 million in 2013 183 million in 2012 and 72 million in 2011 excluding restructuring charges and milestone payments rd expenses increased 11 percent in 2013 and less than 1 percent in 2012 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd expense in 2013 principally included a charge of 175 million as a result of entering into a global license agreement with ablynx nv to develop and commercialize alx0061 a charge of 70 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with alvine pharmaceuticals inc to develop alv003 a charge of 45 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with galapagos nv for cystic fibrosis therapies and charges totaling 48 million as a result of entering into several other arrangements 

iprd expense in 2012 included a charge of 110 million for the acquisition of abt719 a charge of 150 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral nextgeneration jak1 inhibitor and a charge of 28 million as a result of entering into a twoyear collaboration agreement to research develop and commercialize up to three compounds with antibodydrug conjugate approaches 

iprd expense in 2011 included a charge of 188 million for the achievement of a developmental milestone under a licensing agreement for bardoxolone methyl and charges of 400 million and 85 million for entering into collaboration agreements for secondgeneration oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an anticd4 biologic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis respectively 

interest expense 

interest expense income net in 2013 was 278 million and was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt partially offset by interest income of 21 million in november 2012 abbvie issued 147 billion of longterm debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and 

entered into interest rate swaps with various financial institutions which converted 80 billion of its fixed rate interest rate debt to floating interest rate debt in addition abbvie issued 10 billion of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2012 the balance of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 was 400 million 

interest expense net in 2012 of 84 million was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt and bridge facility fees related to the separation from abbott partially offset by interest income of 20 million 

other income expense 

other income expense net included expenses of 11 million in 2013 29 million in 2012 and 56 million in 2011 of fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration related to an acquisition of a business in 2010 other income expense net for 2013 2012 and 2011 also included ongoing contractual payments associated with the conclusion of a preexisting joint venture arrangement dissolved in 2008 other income expense net in 2012 included income of 21 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement and a loss of 52 million for the impairment of an equity security 

income tax expense 

the income tax rates were 226 percent in 2013 79 percent in 2012 and 64 percent in 2011 income taxes in 2012 and 2011 included the recognition of tax benefits totaling approximately 195 million and 410 million respectively as a result of favorable resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to prior years the increase in the effective tax rate in 2013 over 2012 is principally due to income tax expense related to certain 2013 earnings outside the united states that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested and the absence of the 195 million of tax benefits recorded in 2012 as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year income taxes in 2011 also reflected the nondeductibility of a litigation reserve 

transition from abbott and cost to operate as an independent company 

abbvies historical financial statements for periods prior to january 1 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect abbvies financial position results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of abbott rather than as an independent company abbvie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions incremental information technologyrelated costs and incremental costs to operate a standalone back office infrastructure outside the united states 

abbvies transition services agreements with abbott in the united states cover certain corporate support services that abbvie has historically received from abbott such services include information technology accounts payable payroll and other financial functions as well as engineering support for various facilities quality assurance support and other administrative services the terms of the services under the agreements vary by activity these agreements facilitate the separation by allowing abbvie to operate independently prior to establishing standalone back office functions across its organization 

as of the date of the separation abbvie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the united states as a result abbvie entered into transition services agreements with abbott to provide services outside the united states including back office services in certain countries for up to two years after separation the back office services provided include information technology accounts payable payroll receivables collection treasury and other financial functions as well as order entry warehousing and other administrative services these transition services agreements have allowed abbvie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to 

establishing a standalone back office infrastructure for all countries during the transition from abbott abbvie has and will continue to incur nonrecurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure in addition in certain international markets as of the date of the separation and as of december 31 2013 certain marketing authorizations to sell abbvies products continued to be held by abbott until such authorizations could be transferred through the applicable regulatory channels 

it is not practicable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred in each of the periods presented in the historical financial statements for the functions described above actual costs that would have been incurred if abbvie operated as a standalone company during these periods would have depended on various factors including organizational design outsourcing and other strategic decisions related to corporate functions information technology and international back office infrastructure refer to note 1 for further description of transactions between abbvie and abbott 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 



strong cash flows from operating activities were driven by net earnings and focused working capital management in 2013 cash flows from operating activities also reflected cash paid for taxes of 13 billion cash paid for interest of 283 million and a voluntary contribution to its main domestic defined benefit pension plan of 145 million in 2012 cash flows from operating activities reflected cash paid for interest of 61 million and a voluntary contribution to its sponsored pension plans of 46 million in 2011 abbvie recorded noncash charges of 15 billion in accrued liabilities to establish a litigation reserve related to claims on abbvies previous sales and marketing activities for depakote abbvie made payments of 16 billion in 2012 to settle these claims 

cash flows from investing activities in 2013 and 2012 reflected capital expenditures net sales purchases of shortterm investments and payments related to certain collaboration license and acquisition agreements refer to note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements included under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for information regarding significant collaboration license and acquisition agreements 

abbvie issued senior notes of 147 billion in november 2012 and 10 billion of commercial paper in december 2012 abbotts guarantee of the senior notes terminated upon the distribution of abbvie common stock to the shareholders of abbott upon the separation on january 1 2013 the senior notes which have maturities ranging from three to 30 years may be redeemed at any time except the floating rate notes and some of the senior notes of each series at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a makewhole premium in 2013 the company issued and redeemed commercial paper the balance of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 400 million and 10 billion respectively at weightedaverage interest rates of 02 and 04 respectively for each period abbvie may retire or issue additional commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed historically cash flows from financing activities represented cash transactions with abbott 

the companys cash and equivalents and shortterm investments increased from 80 billion at december 31 2012 to 99 billion at december 31 2013 during 2012 abbott contributed approximately 44 billion of cash to newly formed abbvie entities and abbvie distributed 132 billion in cash and debt securities to abbott subsequent to the separation effective january 1 2013 abbvie no longer participates in cash management and funding arrangements with abbott 

while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31 2013 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources if these funds were needed for operations in the united states abbvie would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31 2013 has been reinvested indefinitely 

a quarterly dividend of 040 per share was paid on common stock in 2013 resulting in total dividends paid of 256 billion for 2013 on december 12 2013 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 040 per share for stockholders of record on january 15 2014 payable on february 14 2014 abbvie expects to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend however the timing declaration amount of and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors including abbvies financial condition earnings capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries covenants associated with certain of abbvies debt service obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors 

on february 15 2013 the company announced a 15 billion stock repurchase program which was effective immediately purchases of abbvie common stock may be made from time to time at managements discretion the plan has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time during 2013 abbvie repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for 223 million in the open market abbvies remaining stock repurchase authorization is 13 billion as of december 31 2013 

substantially all of abbvies trade receivables in greece portugal italy and spain are with governmental health systems global economic conditions and liquidity issues in these countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses while the company continues to receive payments on these receivables these conditions have resulted in an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding 

outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december 31 were as follows 



with the exception of greece abbvie historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries abbvie continues to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against an accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance 

credit facility access to capital and credit ratings 

credit facility 

abbvie currently has a 20 billion unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders entered into in july 2012 which also supports commercial paper borrowings as of the date of separation january 1 2013 abbotts obligations under this facility were relieved and abbvie became the sole obligor the credit facility enables the company to borrow funds at floating interest rates at december 31 2013 the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants commitment fees under the new credit facility are not material there were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility on december 31 2013 

access to capital 

the company intends to fund shortterm and longterm financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt the companys ability to generate cash flows from operations issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions at the current time the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms to support the companys growth objectives 

credit ratings 

credit ratings of baa1 and a assigned to abbvie in 2012 by moodys investor service and standard  poors corporate respectively have not changed as of december 31 2013 unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements however they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes abbvies estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 



a includes estimated future interest payments on longterm debt securities and capital lease obligations interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2013 projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events the projected interest payments only 

pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31 2013 refer to notes 8 and 9 for further discussion regarding the companys debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at december 31 2013 annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material 

b includes the companys significant unconditional purchase obligations these commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business c amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of 370 million abbvie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to december 31 2013 amounts otherwise exclude pension and other postemployment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns changes in laws and regulations and other variables also included in this amount are components of other longterm liabilities including restructuring and an expected payment related to the contingent salesbased payment recognized as part of the acquisition of a business in 2013 refer to notes 7 and 9 for further information 

abbvie enters into rd collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestones individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period from a business perspective the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement as a result these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations refer to note 5 for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2 certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may vary from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

rebates 

abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans wholesalers group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product for each type of rebate the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of which products have been sold subject to the rebate which customer or government agency price terms apply for that rebate and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the 

rebate using historical trends for that rebate adjusted for current changes abbvie estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbvie records its sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale abbvie regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 

rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded in the same period as the related sales and are reflected as a reduction of sales rebates and chargebacks in 2013 2012 and 2011 totaled 49 billion 43 billion and 37 billion respectively or 30 percent 28 percent and 25 percent respectively of the gross sales subject to rebate a onepercentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by 160 million in 2013 abbvie considers a onepercentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales other allowances for cash discounts and returns charged against gross sales were 748 million 667 million and 617 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter in the united states the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates managed care rebates and wholesaler chargebacks medicaid rebates relate to the federal medicaid program which is administered by state agencies whereby rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities under various laws and regulations and in some cases supplemental rebates are also provided to the states under contractual agreements medicare rebates are negotiated with managed care organizations that manage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit pharmacy benefit manager rebates arise from contractual agreements with private health care plans that seek to reduce costs by negotiating discounts with pharmaceuticals manufacturers under wholesaler chargeback programs the wholesaler charges abbvie back for the difference between the price paid by the wholesaler to abbvie and the price paid by the end customer to the wholesaler under contractual discount agreements negotiated between abbvie and the end customer in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances for each type of rebate management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for that rebate external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data to estimate the rebate percentage or net price systems and calculations are used to track sales by product and by customer or payer and to estimate the contractual or statutory rebate or net price abbvie believes systems and calculations are reliable 

the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances which comprise approximately 88 percent of the combined rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2013 remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 



historically adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income abbvie employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it and where possible works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts for medicaid medicare and other government agency programs the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 

cash discounts and returns 

cash discounts can be reliably estimated product returns can be reliably estimated because abbvies historical returns are low and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 

pension and postemployment benefits 

abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions the significant assumptions which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on highquality fixedincome investments at december 31 each year abbvie employs a yieldcurve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using highquality bonds the discount rate is the single rate that equates the discounted cash flows to the rates utilizing the yield curve as a result the yieldcurve approach reflects the specific cash flows for plans ie duration in calculating the discount rate for other countries abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate abbvies assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and postemployment plans as of december 31 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014 a 05 change in the assumed 

discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2014 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2013 



the expected longterm rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future returns abbvie considers these inputs with a longterm focus to avoid shortterm market influences the current longterm rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trusts actual and target asset allocation abbvies assumed expected longterm rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014 as of december 31 2013 a 1 change in assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2014 by 28 million 

the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014 a 1 change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvies calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2014 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2013 



income taxes 

abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method provisions for federal state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards a valuation allowance is established or maintained when based on currently available information it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

litigation 

the company is subject to contingencies such as legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business refer to note 13 for further information loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss or when a best estimate cannot be made a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be 

zero is recorded as information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provisions or a best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provisions occasionally a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected there were no significant litigation reserves at december 31 2013 

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows risk cost of capital terminal values and market participants each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset iprd acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for as a definitelived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life iprd acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life 

abbvie reviews the recoverability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

for its impairment reviews the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign currency exchange rates the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the companys business plans and a market participants views of a company and similar companies the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the companys results of operations actual results may differ from the companys estimates 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization totaled 82 billion and 85 billion respectively and amortization expense for intangible assets was 509 million 625 million and 764 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively there were no impairments of goodwill in 2013 2012 or 2011 and the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of abbvies single reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value in 2012 and 2011 abbvie recorded impairment charges of 13 million and 46 million respectively for certain projects under development these charges are included in rd expenses 

certain regulatory matters 

legislative issues 

in the first quarter of 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively referred to herein as health care reform legislation were signed into law in the united states health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic medicaid rebate rate from 151 percent to 231 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations starting in 2011 additional rebates were incurred 

related to the medicare part d coverage gap donut hole these medicare and medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on abbvies gross profit margin in future years 

in 2011 abbvie began recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs the amount of the annual fee which totaled approximately 110 million in 2013 and 100 million in both 2012 and 2011 is based on the ratio of certain of abbvies sales as compared to the total such sales of all covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year the fee is not tax deductible and is included in sga expenses 

abbvies markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations abbvie expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to risk that its earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates certain derivative instruments are used when available on a costeffective basis to hedge the companys underlying economic exposures refer to note 9 for further information regarding the companys financial instruments and hedging strategies 

foreign currency risk 

abbvies primary net foreign currency exposures are the euro british pound and japanese yen various abbvie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are markedtomarket with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party generally within twelve months at december 31 2013 and 2012 abbvie held 15 billion and 10 billion respectively in notional amounts of such contracts 

abbvie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans the contracts which are not designated as hedges are markedtomarket and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss gain and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed at december 31 2013 and 2012 abbvie held notional amounts of 53 billion and 43 billion respectively of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 



the company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by 692 million at december 31 2013 if realized this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contacts a 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in foreign currencies gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 

currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require abbvie to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government effective february 8 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 43 to 63 which resulted in a loss of 11 million 

in the first quarter of 2013 recorded in net foreign exchange loss gain on the consolidated statement of earnings for 2013 

interest rate risk 

interest rate swaps are used to manage the companys exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixedrate debt the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate abbvie does not use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities at both december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 abbvie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling 80 billion the company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100basis points would have decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately 411 million at december 31 2013 if realized the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts the company estimates that an increase of 100basis points in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of longterm debt by 848 million at december 31 2013 a 100basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in interest rates 

market price sensitive investments 

abbvie holds availableforsale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions the fair value of these investments was approximately 49 million and 12 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would have had an immaterial decrease to their fair value at december 31 2013 a 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible nearterm change in share prices 

nonpublicly traded equity securities 

abbvie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges the carrying value of these investments was approximately 58 million and 72 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively abbvie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs

changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013 there were no changes in abbvies internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect abbvies internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls abbvies management including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer do not expect that abbvies disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
