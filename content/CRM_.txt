mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments 

we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services technologies and intellectual property rights to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our customer 360 platform these evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in recent years notably our acquisition of vlocity in fiscal 2021 which expanded our industryspecific cloud and mobile software solutions and our pending acquisition of slack 

in addition to mergers and acquisitions we invest in earlystage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally to support our business initiatives and enhance our partner ecosystem as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies and investments in emerging markets we plan to continue making these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive 

technology development and operations 

we primarily deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application 

instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other this approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings 

we have historically provided and continue to provide our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center facilities in combination with these thirdparty data center facilities we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer infrastructureasaservice including servers storage databases and networking in december 2020 we announced hyperforce a reimagination of our platform architecture built to securely and reliably deliver the customer 360 platform on major public clouds 

our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services as well as integrating businesses services and technologies from acquisitions performance functional depth security usability ease of integration and configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 

our current competitors include 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality 

• vendors who offer software tailored to specific services that are more directed toward those specific services than our full suite of service offerings 

• suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products as well as business analytics software companies 

• integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions 

• marketing vendors which may specialize in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation 

• ecommerce solutions from established and emerging cloudonly vendors and established onpremises vendors and 

• traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services 

we believe more traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors may become a greater competitive threat as they continue to shift more of their focus to cloud computing service offerings and customer experience management solutions

operational and execution risks 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and have materially affected our operating results and cash flows the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and cash flows remain uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and have materially affected our operating results and cash flows the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results remain uncertain in response to the covid19 pandemic we have cancelled or delayed some customer events and shifted many of them including dreamforce world tours connections tableau conference basecamps and salesforceorg’s higher ed summit to virtualonly experiences we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee and industry events in the future our shift to creating virtual customer employee and industry events may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as or generate the same customer interest opportunities and leads through virtual events as we have historically done through inperson events if we attempt to reintroduce large inperson events we may not be able to do so successfully and our customers may not be able or willing to attend them 

we also temporarily closed all salesforce offices globally this global workfromhome operating environment has caused strain for and has adversely impacted productivity of certain employees and these conditions may persist and harm our business including our future sales and operating results as long as the pandemic continues our employees may be exposed to health risks our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful could expose our employees customers and partners to health risks and us to associated liability and will involve additional financial burdens the covid19 pandemic may have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working this may present risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy and may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business 

moreover the conditions caused by covid19 initially affected customer it spending and may in the future adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services these conditions delayed and may in the future delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions and reduced and may in the future reduce the value or duration of our customers’ subscription contracts and affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

our operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines workfromhome directives and shelterinplace orders these public health measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have impacted our business and results of operations and cash flows for example these measures and related economic effects contributed to certain customers’ reluctance or inability to submit payments to us as well as changes in billing frequency and adversely impacted the effectiveness of outsourced service providers we use to collect payments and these conditions may persist or worsen the extent and duration of these measures could also impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents have resulted in increased internet demand which could cause access issues could affect our ability to develop and support products and services and could cause issues with access to data centers as we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance we may adjust our current policies and practices and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively affect our operations 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic future spikes of covid19 infections resulting in additional preventative measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing and nature of a potential economic recovery impact on our customers and our sales cycles our ability to generate new business leads impact on our customer employee and industry events and effects on our vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted the longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods in addition uncertainty regarding the impact of covid19 on our future operating results and financial condition may result in our taking costcutting measures reducing the level of our capital investments and delaying or canceling the implementation of strategic initiatives any of which may negatively impact our business and reputation if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’ partners’ or customers’ business and productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed the global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided in addition the effects of the covid19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems or authorized access is blocked or disabled our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant reputational harm legal exposure and liabilities or a negative financial impact 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data including financial health and other personal information while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers’ customers data our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following 

• thirdparty attempts to fraudulently induce our employees partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data or it systems or our data or our it systems 

• efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations or nationstates to launch coordinated attacks including distributed denialofservice attacks 

• thirdparty attempts to abuse our marketing advertising or social platforms to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false or misleading 

• cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate or on thirdparty cloudcomputing platform providers 

• vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings 

• vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on 

• vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures including those from acquired companies 

• attacks on or vulnerabilities in the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors partners or customers and 

• employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems 

in addition the changes in our work environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our security measures as well as our ability to address and respond to incidents quickly these risks are mitigated to the extent possible by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies enhanced processes and internal security controls including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks our board of directors audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security as well as periodic updates on cybersecurity events although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security or that a material breach will not occur for example our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following 

• frequent changes to and growth in complexity of the techniques used to breach obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it systems and infrastructure which are generally not recognized until launched against a target and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques 

• the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers which increases the complexity of our it systems 

• the acquisition of new companies requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex it environments 

• authorization by our customers to thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data which may lead to our customers inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers and 

• our limited control over our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of data by thirdparty technology providers which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

in the normal course of business we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents to date such identified security events have not been material or significant to us including to our reputation or business operations or had a material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant additionally as our market presence grows we may face increased risks of cyberattack attempts or security threats 

a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to or the denial of authorized access to our it systems or data or our customers systems or data including intellectual property and proprietary sensitive or other confidential information a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal regulatory and financial exposure and liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities including those arising from thirdparty hardware or software may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware proprietary software and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future such defects could be the result of employee contractor or other thirdparty acts or inaction and could negatively affect our brand and reputation additionally such defects could create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data for example in fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our services for certain customers we determined this disruption did not materially affect our business reputation or financial results but there is no assurance such circumstances could not recur with a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation as a result our services may have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions 

since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make 

warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

any interruptions or delays in services from third parties including data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software hardware and data from a variety of vendors any disruption or damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems or to run our business as we increase our reliance on these thirdparty systems particularly with respect to thirdparty cloud computing platforms our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

for many of our offerings our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real time in a separate facility located elsewhere certain offerings including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions including shelterinplace or similar orders changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic including the covid19 pandemic an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future such as the pending acquisition of slack technologies inc “slack” which was signed in december 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 

acquisitions and other transactions arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all 

• potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment 

• difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services and related costs 

• difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis 

• augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation 

• challenges converting the acquired companys revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues including subscriptionbased revenues and software license revenue as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

• the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

• currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets 

• difficulties in integrating acquired operations technologies services platforms and personnel 

• the inability to obtain or a material delay in obtaining the regulatory approvals including from antitrust or other similar regulatory authorities necessary to complete transactions or to integrate operations or potential remedies imposed by regulatory authorities either as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction such as the global hold separate order issued in connection with our acquisition of tableau by the united kingdom competition  markets authority in fiscal 2020 which order was lifted in fiscal 2020 which may include divestitures ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies 

• failure to fully assimilate integrate or retrain acquired employees which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams 

• differences between our values and those of our acquired companies 

• inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 

• inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business 

• challenges with the acquired companys thirdparty service providers including those that are required for ongoing access to thirdparty data 

• changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition 

• potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products 

• unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology 

• known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses including due to litigation 

• difficulties in managing or potential writeoffs of acquired assets or investments and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers 

• negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets fixed assets and operating lease rightofuse assets 

• the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue 

• challenges relating to the structure of an investment such as governance accountability and decisionmaking conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments 

• difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure 

• additional stockbased compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations 

• delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition 

• ineffective or inadequate controls procedures and policies at the acquired company 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions challenges caused by integrating operations over distance and across different languages cultures and political environments and 

• the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities including a potential onetime income tax payment in connection with the integration of clicksoftware and other acquired israeli entities 

any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations in addition to facilitate acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or 

loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may be impaired by the effects of the covid19 pandemic government actions in light of the pandemic trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the technology sector for example a number of countries including the us and countries in europe and the asiapacific region are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments whether in response to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with increased scrutiny governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature some of which may apply to acquisitions investments or integrations of businesses by us and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we may not complete the acquisition of slack within the time frame we anticipate or at all 

the completion of the acquisition of slack is subject to a number of conditions including receipt of slack stockholder approval expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the hsr act and receipt of other approvals consents or clearances under specified antitrust and foreign investment laws pursuant to the hsr act on february 16 2021 we and slack each received a request for additional information and documentary material often referred to as a “second request” from the antitrust division of the department of justice the “doj” issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the hsr act until 30 days after we and slack have each substantially complied with the second request unless the period for review is extended voluntarily by the parties and the doj or is terminated earlier by the doj we and slack have and will continue to cooperate fully with the doj in its review we continue to anticipate completing the transaction during its fiscal quarter ending july 31 2021 subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement 

the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all for example under certain limited conditions we and slack may elect to terminate the merger agreement which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation a delay in completing the acquisition could cause us to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated time frame which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about the completion of the acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the slack acquisition and the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

we believe that there are significant benefits and synergies that may be realized through combining the products scale and combined enterprise customer bases of salesforce and slack however the efforts to realize these benefits and synergies will be a complex process and may disrupt both companies’ existing operations if not implemented in a timely and efficient manner the full benefits of the acquisition including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay any accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock 

in addition we will be required postclosing to devote significant attention and resources to successfully align our business practices and operations this process may disrupt the businesses and if ineffective would limit the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel particularly through acquisitions which has placed a strain on and in the future may stress the capabilities of our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term whether due to the effects of and financial burdens associated with the covid19 pandemic or otherwise we may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed additionally changes in our work environment and workforce as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our operations the covid19 pandemic may have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working any adjustments made to our current and future office environments or workfromhome policies may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline 

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and mediumsize business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts historically our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees however with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales we have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels mix of customer base decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services 

if customers do not renew their subscriptions do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase our business could be harmed 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in and may in the future result in a reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth and operating results in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure comprises of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent thirdparty organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names “icann” and the internet assigned numbers authority now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future potentially reducing the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

in addition certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content other countries have attempted or are attempting to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on the internet for the delivery of their services additionally the covid19 pandemic has also led to 

quarantines shelterinplace orders and workfromhome directives all of which have increased demands for internet access and may create access challenges these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers increase our risk or add liabilities impede our growth productivity and operational effectiveness result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally include 

• natural disasters acts of war terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies including the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related public health measures and resulting changes to laws and regulations including changes oriented toward protecting local businesses or restricting the movement of our or our customers’ employees 

• localization of our services including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses 

• regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors 

• pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations where we have customers and a balance of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

• foreign currency fluctuations and controls which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results 

• compliance with multiple conflicting ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations including employment tax privacy anticorruption importexport customs antiboycott sanctions and embargoes antitrust data transfer storage and protection and industryspecific laws and regulations including rules related to compliance by our thirdparty resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur 

• liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations including nations with a controlled currency environment which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations 

• vetting and monitoring our thirdparty resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation 

• treatment of revenue from international sources evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

• uncertainty regarding regulation currency tax and operations resulting from the united kingdoms exit from the eu “brexit” on january 31 2020 and possible disruptions in trade the sale of our services and commerce and movement of our people between the united kingdom eu and other locations 

• uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the united states and other governments trade regulations trade wars tariffs other restrictions or other geopolitical events including the evolving relations between the united states and china 

• changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate 

• regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders which grow more complex as we scale expand into new markets and enhance the breadth of our service offerings 

• different pricing environments 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• different or lesser protection of our intellectual property including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property 

• longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties and 

• regional economic and political conditions 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges and we 

may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally moreover restrictions in place in response to the covid19 pandemic have disrupted our operations and our customers’ operations and businesses and this has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our sales efforts 

in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by us a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example in february 2020 keith block resigned as coceo and as a director of the company and in february 2021 mark hawkins resigned as president and chief financial officer of the company such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies our executive officers key management development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business 

the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we are also committed to building a diverse workforce we have experienced significant competition in talent recruitment and retention and may not in the future be successful in our talent recruitment and retention or achieving the diversity goals we have set publicly we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring developing integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers including restrictions imposed in response to the covid19 pandemic these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition equality and a sense of family as our organization grows and expands globally and as employees’ workplace expectations develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture these difficulties may be further amplified by workfromhome requirements imposed and other workforce actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic our inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings outsourced provision of technical support may be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen events for example as occurred when certain business process outsourced service providers were delayed in effectively servicing our customers due to conditions related to the covid19 pandemic increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

strategic and industry risks 

our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate in addition the markets for certain of our offerings including workcom customer 360 truth and other offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts and related investments will ever result in significant revenue for us in addition we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades such as our introduction of hyperforce in fiscal 2021 may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customers administrators and developers as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues in addition because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technologies as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely additionally changes to our work environment and workforce as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our ability to timely develop enhancements to and new features for existing or new services our efforts to quickly introduce new offerings designed to help our customers respond to the covid19 pandemic including our workcom offering may not be successful 

furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies including hyperforce or modifications to existing platforms or technologies including text messaging capabilities or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed including associations with trust customer success innovation and equality have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength particularly for our core services will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features securely reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers’ success even as we scale and expand our services in order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands we may make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services or enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful 

in addition we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties such as office towers and a transit center and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand 

further entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands if we fail to maintain enhance or protect our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies could negatively impact our financial results 

we have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in both domestic and international markets including in emerging markets these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore they are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment likewise the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market conditions and to a lesser extent on liquidity events the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

the rapid spread of covid19 and its reverberating effects on the global economy have caused disruptions to our industry to the industries in which our portfolio companies operate and to financial markets these disruptions are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of our portfolio companies to meet their performance targets raise fundraising rounds or complete a liquidity event in some cases our portfolio companies may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced revenues or profitability increased customer attrition delayed cancelled or unsuccessful public offerings reduced ability to raise additional rounds of financing reduced acquisition offers or acquisition offers on unfavorable terms reduced valuations in both private and public markets or insolvency and bankruptcy these outcomes could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem has matured the opportunities in which we can invest have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with an initial public offering in addition to our investments in earlytolatestage private companies therefore our investment strategy and portfolio have also expanded to include more mature companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a period of time after a public offering including market standoff agreements and lockup agreements 

we record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations as a result we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time for example some of our investments in publicly traded securities may be subject to lockup agreements which would prevent our ability to sell these investments after a public offering or otherwise impede our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities volatility in the financial markets including the impact of the covid19 pandemic has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio 

all of our investments especially our investments in privately held companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital in addition in the future we may deploy material investments in individual investee companies resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements 

if thirdparty developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services or if our customers seek warranties from us for thirdparty applications integrations data and content our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of thirdparty developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations data and content that are complementary to our services without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations data and content both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive which could impact future sales in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security or 

integrity of the data access transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our reputation and our business 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

our current competitors include 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality 

• vendors who offer software tailored to specific services that are more directed toward those specific services than our full suite of service offerings 

• suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products as well as business analytics software companies 

• integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions 

• marketing vendors which may specialize in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation 

• ecommerce solutions from established and emerging cloudonly vendors and established onpremises vendors and 

• traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services 

in addition we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories more significant installed bases broader geographic scope broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical personnel and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers’ demands these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing as a result even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business 

social and ethical issues including the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability 

positions we take on social and ethical issues may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers which has in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain customers we also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to these positions further actions taken by our customers including through the use or misuse of our products may result in reputational harm or possible liability for example we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties although we believe that such claims lack merit such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings as with many innovations ai and our customer 360 platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business for example the development of ai and customer 360 the latter of which provides information regarding our customers’ customers presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on 

human rights privacy employment or in other social contexts we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability data practices by us or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions this in turn could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm 

our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability equality and ethical use and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could harm our reputation or brand and could adversely impact our relationships with our customers our disclosures on these matters and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards may influence our reputation and the value of our brand for example we have elected to share publicly certain information about our corporate environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives and our commitment to the recruitment of a diverse workforce our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities including from the investment community and our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth 

legal and regulatory risks 

privacy concerns and laws such as the forthcoming california privacy rights act the california consumer privacy act and the european union’s general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy cybersecurity data protection data sovereignty and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data generally in some cases data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” that took effect in may 2018 impose obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor as well as on many of our customers in addition new domestic data privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 and the california privacy rights act which will amend the ccpa in january 2023 similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers potentially as both businesses and service providers these laws continue to evolve and as various states introduce similar proposals we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens further laws and legislative proposals such as the eu’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities 

although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance including as a result of penalties fines and lawsuits related to data breaches these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some cases impact our ability or our customers ability to offer our services in certain locations to deploy our solutions to reach current and prospective customers or to derive insights from customer data globally for example on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield framework one of the mechanisms that allowed companies including salesforce to transfer personal data from the european economic area “eea” to the united states in addition the cjeu commented that companies relying on another such mechanism the european commission’s standard contractual clauses should assess on a casebycase basis whether the law of the country of destination ensures adequate protection of personal data transferred under eu law by providing where necessary additional safeguards to those offered by those clauses salesforce relies upon binding corporate rules a third mechanism which provides additional safeguards with respect to government requests for eu personal data as well as the european commission’s standard contractual clauses to transfer eu personal data internationally depending on how the cjeu’s decision is enforced the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase based on draft recommendations issued by the european data protection board “edpb” a body of privacy regulators from across the eu charged with ensuring consistent application of gdpr current indications are that absent agreement on a new bilateral crossborder transfer mechanism to replace the euus privacy shield framework regulators may be inclined to interpret the decision as significantly restricting certain crossborder transfers certain countries outside of the eea eg russia china and india have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency by way of further example statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under ccpa and potentially other states laws may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers and our customers customers lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business in addition we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations including through private actions for alleged noncompliance which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation for example in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a dutch privacy advocacy group on behalf of certain dutch citizens that claims we violated the gdpr and dutch telecommunications act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our audience studio and data studio products we were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the uk although we believe that these claims lack merit these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

furthermore the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate particularly in regard to covid19related data processing may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity which may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively in addition new products we develop in connection with changing events such as in response to the covid19 pandemic may expose us to liability or regulatory risk even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry “pci” data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

further in some cases industryspecific regionallyspecific or productspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results this impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” and related federal communication commission orders which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained we have been and may in the future be subject to one or more classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights as well as commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour antitrust data privacy and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we have also been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers including through the use or misuse of our products for example we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties although we believe that such claims lack merit such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

our exposure to risks associated with various claims including claims related to the use of intellectual property as well as securities and related stockholder derivative claims may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against tableau that remain outstanding and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs additionally we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies in addition third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims or lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results including our operating cash flow in a particular period in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many us patents and pending us and international patent applications we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties similar uncertainty applies to our us and international trademark registrations and applications furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us and elsewhere effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries’ intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others’ rights the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standardsetting activity our contribution to open source projects various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us cause us to divert time and resources from our core business and harm our business 

lawsuits were filed against slack salesforce and the members of the slack board in connection with the mergers and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the mergers andor substantial costs to salesforce 

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition merger or other business combination agreements like the merger agreement even if such a lawsuit is without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources an adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition 

after the mergers were announced seven lawsuits were filed by purported slack stockholders in the united states district court for the northern district of california and six lawsuits were filed by purported slack stockholders in the united states district court for the southern district of new york each in connection with the mergers the complaints named as defendants slack the members of the slack board and with respect to three of the actions salesforce and alleged among other things that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement relating to the proposed mergers to be filed with the sec in violation of sections 14a and 20a of the exchange act and rule 14a9 promulgated thereunder and that slack’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the mergers on february 22 2021 slack filed a current report on form 8k in which it voluntarily made supplemental disclosures relating to the proposed mergers by march 3 2021 all thirteen of the pending cases had been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 

one of the conditions to the closing of the mergers is that no injunction by any governmental entity having jurisdiction over salesforce or slack has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted in either case that prohibits the closing of the mergers consequently if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the mergers that injunction may delay or prevent the mergers from being completed within the expected time frame or at all which may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any lawsuits filed in connection with the mergers the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the mergers are completed may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause and termination of any such contract may adversely impact our other existing or prospective government contracts any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls where we conduct our business activities including the us commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with applicable trade laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of trade privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining necessary authorizations including any required licenses may be timeconsuming require expenditure of corporate resources is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and parties even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in trade regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations import and export control regulations in the us and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty including as a result of geopolitical developments relations between the united states and china and the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

financial risks 

because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods including changes resulting from the effects of the covid19 pandemic our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 

due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations and unanticipated events such as the covid19 pandemic may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or at all without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and in some periods we have not been able to and may not be able in the future to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in operations changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws any changes ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state local or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles or changes to our business operations including as a result of acquisitions any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position 

as our business continues to grow increasing our brand recognition and profitability we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes which may impact our cash flows and financial results furthermore our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile and if perceived negatively may cause brand or reputational harm 

as we utilize our tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years which could have a material impact to our future cash flows in addition changes to our operating structure including changes related to acquisitions may result in cash tax obligations 

global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business cash flow from operating activities or financial results such developments for example include the organization for economic cooperation and development’s the european commission’s and certain major jurisdictions heightened interest in and taxation of companies participating in the digital economy governments’ responses to the economic impact of covid19 may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the british pound sterling 

we primarily conduct our business in the following regions the americas europe and asia pacific the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets including in emerging markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in euro british pound sterling japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar as well as the euro against the british pound sterling these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings additionally global events including the sudden and unexpected effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as geopolitical developments fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments have caused and may in the future cause global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

our debt service obligations lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as of january 31 2021 we had a substantial level of debt including our 2023 and 2028 senior notes senior notes” and the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 fremont due june 2023 in december 2020 we entered into a credit agreement the “revolving loan credit agreement” which provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” that matures in december 2025 replacing our previous revolving credit facility of 10 billion there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of january 31 2021 we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include without limitation financing the consideration for and fees costs and expenses related to any acquisition in addition in connection with our pending acquisition of slack in december 2020 we obtained a 364day senior unsecured bridge loan facility “bridge facility” the original commitments in respect of the bridge facility were 100 billion but were reduced to 70 billion in december 2020 following our entry into a 30 billion threeyear senior unsecured loan agreement “acquisition term loan” in february 2021 we elected to further reduce our bridge facility commitments to 40 billion the availability and funding of the bridge facility and the acquisition term loan are conditioned on the consummation of the acquisition of slack in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and are subject to certain exceptions qualifications and other conditions we expect to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the acquisition with the incurrence of new indebtedness or commitments in respect thereof 

in addition to the outstanding and contemplated debt obligations above we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our longterm lease agreements we also have significant other contractual commitments such as commitments with infrastructure service providers which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 

maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments and 

• make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business our industry or the economy in general such as recent downturns in connection with the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to 

service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business in addition we may seek debt financing to fund future acquisitions following the slack acquisition we can offer no assurance that we can obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

in addition adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit facilities may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

lease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease these options are reflected in the operating lease rightofuse rou asset which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option we reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control the potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we may be required to change our accounting policies to alter our operational policies to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards and to adjust our published financial statements such changes may have an adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets which may negatively impact our financial results 

in addition as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” the sustainability accounting standards board “sasb” and our own esg materiality assessment we have expanded and in the future may continue to expand our disclosures in these areas our failure to report accurately or achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth 

risks related to owning our common stock 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks including the sudden and unanticipated effects of the covid19 pandemic in addition our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter this trend has been adversely impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related economic downturn and uncertainties 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

• general economic or geopolitical conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which can adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services or delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect attrition rates 

• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements 

• the attrition rates for our services 

• the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force 

• the length of the sales cycle for our services 

• new product and service introductions by our competitors 

• our success in selling our services to large enterprises 

• changes in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation due to seasonality the timing of and compounding effects of renewals invoice duration size and timing new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter average contract term the collectability of invoices related to multiyear agreements the timing of license software revenue recognition or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements all of which may impact implied growth rates 

• our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships acquisitions or investments 

• variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an onpremise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront 

• the seasonality of our sales cycle including software license sales and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time 

• changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts whether initiated by us or as a result of competition customer preference or other factors 

• changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers as have been and may continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• the seasonality of our customers’ businesses especially our commerce service offering customers including retailers and branded manufacturers 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business 

• the number of new employees 

• the timing of commission bonus and other compensation payments to employees including decisions to guarantee some portion of commissions payments in connection with extraordinary events such as the partial commission guarantee in the fiscal quarter ended april 30 2020 

• the cost timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services 

• the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the followon costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses 

• expenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate including our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion 

• timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services 

• expenses related to significant unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur including for example expenses related to the covid19 pandemic 

• extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other disputerelated settlement payments 

• income tax effects resulting from but not limited to tax law changes court decisions on tax matters global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity 

• the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock options 

• technical difficulties or interruptions in our services 

• changes in interest rates and our mix of investments which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities 

• conditions and particularly sudden changes in the financial markets such as the recent volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic which have impacted and may continue to impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio 

• changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in earlytolatestage privately held and public companies which could negatively and materially impact our financial results particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations 

• equity or debt issuances including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions 

• the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straightline basis over their vesting schedules 

• evolving regulations of cloud computing and crossborder data transfer restrictions and similar regulations 

• regulatory compliance and acquisition costs and 

• the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet the market price of our common stock could decline in addition if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

• variations in our operating results earnings per share cash flows from operating activities unearned revenue remaining performance obligation yearoveryear growth rates for individual service offerings and other financial metrics and nonfinancial metrics such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics and how those results compare to analyst expectations 

• variations in and limitations of the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business 

• forwardlooking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to for example future revenue current remaining performance obligation cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors many of which are beyond our control including general economic and market conditions and unanticipated delays in the integration of acquired companies as a result of regulatory review 

• our ability to meet or exceed forwardlooking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors analysts or others our ability to give forwardlooking guidance consistent with past practices and changes to or withdrawal of previous guidance or longrange targets including due to uncertainty in connection with effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock 

• announcements of technological innovations new services or service enhancements strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors 

• announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors 

• announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases 

• the coverage of our common stock by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

• recruitment or departure of key personnel 

• disruptions in our service due to computer hardware software network or data center problems 

• the economy as a whole geopolitical conditions including global trade and health concerns market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers 

• trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 

• the issuance of shares of common stock by us whether in connection with an acquisition or a capitalraising transaction 

• issuance of debt or other convertible securities 

• changes to our credit ratings and 

• environmental social governance and other issues impacting our reputation 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market including debt offerings in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation such as securities litigation against tableau that was brought before we acquired that company such litigation whether against salesforce or an acquired subsidiary could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

• permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan also known as a “poison pill” 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

general risks 

volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in connection with the covid19 pandemic and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can arise suddenly as did the conditions associated with the covid19 pandemic and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict in addition geopolitical and domestic political developments such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets as has been the case with the covid19 pandemic and relations between the united states and china moreover these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of it spending could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services have delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts and we expect these conditions will adversely affect our customer attrition rates all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shutoffs or shortages actual or threatened public health emergencies including the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other events beyond our control for example in response to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed our offices globally including our corporate headquarters and are experiencing and expect to continue to experience ongoing effects related to the local and global economic and other effects of this 

pandemic although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our personnel research and development activities it systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event such as the covid19 pandemic for example wildfires have resulted in power shutoffs in the san francisco bay area and are likely to occur in the future and this could adversely affect the workfromhome operations of our employees in the san francisco bay area 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climaterelated risks we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our california headquarters have historically experienced and are projected to continue to experience climaterelated events at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention furthermore it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees while they work from home as a result of the covid19 pandemic changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our thirdparty suppliers and the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations

 item 2 properties 

as of january 31 2021 our executive and principal offices for sales marketing professional services development and administration consisted of approximately 18 million square feet of leased and owned property in san francisco excluded from this amount is approximately 362000 square feet in san francisco that is currently sublet as well as approximately 297000 square feet in san francisco currently available for sublease as we began consolidating and subleasing additional real estate leases in fiscal 2021 

we also lease office space for our operations in various locations throughout the united states as well as office space in a number of countries in europe north america asia south america africa and australia 

we operate data centers in the us europe and asia pursuant to various colocation lease arrangements 

we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements if we require additional space we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable commercially reasonable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements

overview 

we are a global leader in customer relationship management crm technology that brings companies and customers together with our customer 360 platform we deliver a single source of truth connecting customer data across systems apps and devices to help companies sell service market and conduct commerce from anywhere since our founding in 1999 we have pioneered innovations in cloud mobile social analytics and artificial intelligence “ai” enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the alldigital workfromanywhere era 

covid19 impact 

in december 2019 the novel coronavirus and resulting disease “covid19” was first reported after ongoing assessment of the rapid spread number of cases and countries affected on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have been guided by our core values of trust customer success innovation and equality beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal 2021 we took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity supporting our employees helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and the longterm success of our business 

as a result of the pandemic we experienced a slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same prioryear period however new business grew during the remainder of fiscal 2021 at rates consistent with historical trends prior to covid19 in addition as a result of actions taken by us in response to the pandemic we experienced incremental operating expenses and lower than expected operating cash flows for the full year of fiscal 2021 when compared to historical trends for example changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our gotomarket efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the year in fiscal 2021 our income from operations benefited from our global work from home policy and limited business travel by our employees we continue to evaluate our office space needs and as a result we recorded approximately 216 million of impairments to assets associated with real estate 

leases in select locations we have decided to exit of which approximately 184 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

in addition we have in the past implemented strategic realignments to position our company for future growth and will continue to do so particularly as we evaluate the impact of covid19 on our business as part of our current strategic realignment we have redirected and may in the future redirect some resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas as well as to increase investments in our gotomarket and product efforts as a result of these investments and redirection efforts which included some position eliminations we saw an increase in expenses in fiscal 2021 in addition as we continue to evaluate our office space needs we may record additional impairments to associated assets as we adjust and refine our strategy there may be additional investments and redirection efforts in the future 

we do not yet know the impact the pandemic will have on our longterm revenue growth and profitability authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines workfromhome directives and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and could continue to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide these business slowdowns and shutdowns have impacted and may continue to impact our business and results of operations for example the extent and duration of these measures could impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents have resulted in increased internet demand which could cause access issues could affect our ability to develop and support products and services and could cause issues with access to data centers 

the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance depends on certain developments including the duration of the pandemic and any resurgences the severity of the disease responsive actions taken by public health officials the development distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines the impacts on our customers and our sales cycles our ability to generate new business leads the impacts on our customers employee and industry events and the effects on our vendors all of which are uncertain and currently cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty as a result the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain due to our primarily subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’ partners’ or customers’ productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed in addition the global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided 

see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

highlights from the fiscal year 2021 

• revenue total fiscal 2021 revenue was 213 billion an increase of 24 percent yearoveryear 

• earnings per share  fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share was 438 as compared to earnings per share of 015 from a year ago and was benefited by approximately 20 billion from the onetime discrete tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intraentity transfer of intangible property and an unrealized gain of 17 billion associated with the initial public offerings of two of our strategic investments 

• cash cash provided by operations for fiscal 2021 was 48 billion an increase of 11 percent yearoveryear total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities ended fiscal 2021 at 120 billion 

• remaining performance obligation  remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately 361 billion an increase of 17 percent yearoveryear current remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately 180 billion an increase of 20 percent yearoveryear 

• acquisition during fiscal 2021 we completed the acquisition of vlocity inc vlocity for 14 billion consisting primarily of 12 billion in cash additionally during fiscal 2021 we announced our pending acquisition of slack technologies inc “slack” a leading channelbased messaging platform which is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals for an estimated 156 billion in cash and 45 million shares of salesforce common stock based on slack class a and class b shares outstanding as of january 31 2021 

we continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key growth levers including driving multicloud adoption increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industryspecific reach with more vertical software solutions these growth drivers often require a more sophisticated gotomarket approach and as a result we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue as a result we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics have lower attrition rates than our company average 

we plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions we regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings past acquisitions have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions in new categories including analytics and integration we continue to evaluate investment opportunities and expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future such as our pending acquisition of slack slack has an integrated value proposition across all of our service offerings and upon close of the transaction and successful product integration we believe it will further enable companies to grow and succeed in an alldigital workfromanywhere era 

as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income 

we periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for longterm growth which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity in addition we have experienced and may at times in the future experience more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions and increased enterprise solution selling activities slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods particularly if experienced on a sustained basis 

the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets including as a result of covid19 expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on our revenue results for fiscal 2021 in addition fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on both our remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation as of january 31 2021 we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2021 for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2021 

operating segments 

we operate as one segment see note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources subscription and support revenues and related professional services subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2021 

subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services collectively cloud services cloud services allow customers to use our multitenant software without taking possession of the software revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support are generally recognized ratably over the contract term changes in contract duration for multiyear licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2021 

the revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings as described below in “results of operations” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time additionally we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and as a result the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter in addition some of our cloud service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use our sales service or platform service offering to record account and contact information which are similar features across these service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage 

our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers we calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelvemonth basis as of the end of each month as of january 31 2021 our attrition rate excluding our integration service offering salesforceorg and tableau 

was between 90 and 95 prior to fiscal year 2021 our attrition rate excluded our commerce service offering in general we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization while our attrition rate is difficult to predict we expect it to remain consistent or slightly better in the near term due to the diversity of size industry and geography within the customer base however our attrition rate may increase over time including for example as a result of covid19 

we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues 

seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearonyear compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter conversely our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter in response to covid19 we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and changed billing frequencies for other customers throughout fiscal 2021 which has delayed payments to periods later than expected we also have accelerated our investments in our gotomarket and product efforts throughout fiscal 2021 which resulted in increased expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flow these efforts have affected and may continue to affect trends related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenues accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions for example operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below in millions 

remaining performance obligation 

our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months 

remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors including seasonality the timing of renewals average contract terms foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increase if the agreement is renewed low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer changes in contract duration can impact remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation 

remaining performance obligation consisted of the following in billions 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions including our acquisition of vlocity in june 2020 and our acquisition of tableau in august 2019 expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support including the costs of data center capacity certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data and employeerelated costs such as salaries and benefits 

cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and certain thirdparty fees we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and allocated overhead 

marketing and sales   

marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and commissions for our sales and marketing staff as well as payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities we capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts such as commissions and amortize these costs on a straightline basis payments of these commissions are not consistent with the period in which the expense is recognized 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition  contracts with multiple performance obligations we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services software licenses premium support and professional services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment 

cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately in determining whether professional services are distinct we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct 

we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where services are sold price lists our gotomarket strategy historical sales and contract prices in instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to ssp 

in certain cases we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices if ssp is not directly observable for example when pricing is highly variable we use a range of ssp we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography 

costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straightline basis over four years which although longer than the typical initial contract period reflects the average period of benefit including expected contract renewals significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit therefore we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are 

• future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts professional services contracts other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents 

• historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers 

• assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings 

• discount rates 

• uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed 

• fair value of assumed equity awards and 

• fair value of preexisting relationships 

unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

in fiscal 2021 we changed our international corporate structure which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of 20 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible property we made significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projected revenues operating expenses and geographic earnings mix in the valuation models we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and will regularly evaluate its realizability 

strategic investments accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 

valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available as adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold 

we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics market acceptance of the product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is considered to be impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment 

the particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company as a result our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of january 31 2021 could result in a 66 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated in millions 



1 amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations as follows in millions 



2 amounts related to stockbased expenses as follows in millions 



3 during fiscal 2021 two of our strategic investments completed their initial public offering resulting in an unrealized gain of 17 billion as of january 31 2021 

4 amounts include approximately 20 billion of onetime benefit from a discrete tax item related to the recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from an intraentity transfer of intangible property in fiscal 2021 and a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of 612 million for fiscal 2019 

the following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated in millions except remaining performance obligation which is presented in billions 



1 amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations 

remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods 

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 compared to the same period of fiscal 2020 was impacted by our acquisitions in the current and prior year including the acquisition of tableau in the prior year which was our largest acquisition to date in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2020 we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the fiscal year subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

fiscal year ended january 31 2021 and 2020 

revenues 



the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity pricing was 

not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period revenues from term and perpetual software licenses which are recognized at a point in time represent approximately six percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2021 subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately 15 billion and 652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively and is included in the above amounts as a result of our business combination activity we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity 

the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

subscription and support revenue by service offering 

subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



our industry offerings revenue is included in either sales service or platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased subscription and support revenues from platform and other benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of tableau in fiscal 2021 as compared to six months in fiscal 2020 the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings have been and may be impacted by covid19 in the future depending on our customers’ actual and projected business needs for example we experienced increased demand for our marketing and commerce service offering for fiscal 2021 when compared to prior periods 

revenues by geography were as follows  



revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity which may be different than the region of the customer the increase in americas revenues was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services and the investment of additional sales resources the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international sales resources revenues in the americas and europe also benefited from our acquisition of tableau in august 2019 foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2021 and 2020 

cost of revenues 



for fiscal 2021 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of 330 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 37 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 275 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 222 million and an increase in third party fees and allocated overhead service delivery costs associated with our perpetual and term software licenses are lower than service delivery costs associated with our cloud service offerings and as a result our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2021 benefited in part due to this shift in our business mix 

we have increased our headcount associated with our data centers customer support and professional services by 18 percent since fiscal 2020 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

operating expenses 



for fiscal 2021 the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 508 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 193 million in stockbased expenses and increases in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead our research and development headcount increased by 11 percent since fiscal 2020 in order to improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

for fiscal 2021 the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of 14 billion in employeerelated costs and amortization of deferred commissions an increase of 89 million in stockbased expenses an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 107 million and allocated overhead partially offset by a reduction in employee travel and expenses marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2021 were also negatively impacted by the onetime partial minimum commission guarantee offered to our direct sales force our marketing and sales headcount increased by 14 percent since fiscal 2020 primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel we also expect an increase in marketing and sales expenses due to the gradual increase of travel and related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2022 

for fiscal 2021 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs as well as being impacted by our charitable donations to members of our ecosystem and community our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since fiscal 2020 as we added personnel to support our growth while not material to date we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid19 pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessments 

as a result of the june 2019 salesforceorg business combination we effectively settled all existing agreements between ourselves and salesforceorg and as part of business combination accounting accordingly recorded a onetime noncash operating expense charge of approximately 166 million in fiscal 2020 related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement 

other income and expense 



gains on strategic investments net consists primarily of marktomarket adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments net gains recognized during fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded equity securities of 17 billion and realized gains on sales of equity securities of 04 billion 

other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income interest expense was 126 million and 131 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively investment income decreased 34 million in fiscal 2021 respectively compared to the same period a year ago due to lower interest rates across our portfolio modestly offset by larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances upon closing of our acquisition of slack we expect an increase in interest expense due to debt agreements we plan to enter into in connection with the pending acquisition 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



in fiscal 2021 we recognized a tax benefit of 15 billion on a pretax income of 26 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we changed our international corporate structure which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of 20 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value the determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management the tax amortization related to the intellectual property transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under irish tax laws the deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted irish tax rate we believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in ireland 

in fiscal 2020 we recognized a tax provision of 580 million on a pretax income of 706 million our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

fiscal year ended january 31 2020 and 2019

cash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash provided by operating activities unbilled amounts related to contracted noncancelable subscription agreements which is not reflected on the balance sheet and if necessary our borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months in addition we expect to have a sufficient combination of available cash and borrowing capacity to fund the aggregate cash portion of the pending acquisition of slack which is expected to be approximately 156 billion sources of financing associated with our pending acquisition of slack are detailed below in “debt” 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies and intellectual property rights to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments

• approximately 14 billion in donated or discounted products provided to nonprofits and higher education institutions via salesforceorg we calculate the social value of products sold or donated based on the estimated price we would have received if a comparable product was sold to a forprofit business of similar size and location less the price that we received if any for the same product from a qualified nonprofit educational institution or other nongovernment organization “ngo” when a comparable salesforce product price was not readily available we used a ratio based on the weighted average of the salesforce price to a forprofit company compared to the salesforce price to a nonprofit company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risks this exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of nearterm possible movements caused by the impact of covid19 as discussed in more detail below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada latin america asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets including emerging markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion costs associated with thirdparty infrastructure providers additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and brazilian real against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including market impacts associated with covid19 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

in fiscal 2020 we began transitioning away from our ukcentralized european structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe including germany and france to invoice customers directly this transition which may take multiple years is expected to enable local subsidiaries to recognize revenues operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies with the change to local invoicing in some markets we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency 

in january 2020 the uk exited the european union “eu” “brexit” in december 2020 a trade agreement was entered into between the uk and the eu and in january 2021 the transition period ended and the uk was no longer subject to eu rules or regulations brexit and the new ukeu trade agreement could adversely affect the uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound sterling and euro we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations in fiscal 2021 and 2020 revenues generated in europe were approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total revenues respectively of which most are recorded in our uk germany france italy spain and ireland subsidiaries revenues in europe had a minimal favorable impact in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of fluctuations in the euro and british pound sterling against the usd we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer accounts receivable intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies throughout the year the amounts of revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during fiscal 2020 using a constant currency rate however fluctuations in usd against certain international currencies over the past several months modestly benefited our remaining performance obligation as of january 31 2021 compared to what we would have reported as of january 31 2020 using constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 120 billion as of january 31 2021 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixedrate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses 

our fixedincome portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at january 31 2021 could result in a 63 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 79 billion changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 38 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in addition we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk as follows in millions 



1 maturity date will be 364 days following the closing of the pending slack acquisition 

2 maturity date is three years following the closing of the pending slack acquisition 

any borrowings under the bridge facility will bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0875 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time and subject to increases of 025 on each of the 90th 180th and 270th day following the initial funding of the bridge facility as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amounts under the bridge facility 

any borrowings under our acquisition term loan bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0125 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time our acquisition term loan allows for the libor rate to be phased out and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the acquisition term loan 

the borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0125 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating our credit facility allows for the libor rate to be phased out and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our 

counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally including in emerging markets we primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies technology startups and system integrators to advance and expand our ecosystem as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies we plan to continue these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive our strategy includes using proceeds from realized gains recognized on the sales of our existing strategic investments to in part fund these new strategic investments 

as of january 31 2021 our portfolio consisted of investments in over 280 companies with capital investments ranging from less than 03 million to approximately 335 million and 40 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately 10 million as of january 31 2021 we held one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investments one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was greater than 15 percent of our total strategic investments and one privately held investment with a carrying value greater than five percent of our strategic investment portfolio 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of january 31 2021 and excludes exited investments in millions 



we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices observable price changes and impairments to our investments these changes could be material based on market conditions and events while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio volatility in the global market conditions including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of covid19 and related public health measures may impact our investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations 

our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences the particular securities we hold and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company as a result our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our publicly traded and significant privately held equity securities held as of january 31 2021 which represents 74 percent of the strategic investment portfolio could result in a 272 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment 

we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering one of our publicly traded investments which individually had a carrying value of approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investment portfolio is subject to lockup agreements until march 2021 for the investment made prior to their initial public offering “ipo” and september 2021 for the investment made concurrent with their ipo a portion of our holdings was released from the lockup agreement early as certain criteria were met 

in addition the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment all of our investments particularly those in privately held companies are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital the rapid spread of covid19 and its reverberating effects on the global economy have caused disruptions to the industry and to financial markets that are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of investee companies to complete a liquidity event in severe cases our investee companies may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced profitability delayed public offerings reduced ability to raise favorable rounds of financing or acquisitions at less favorable 

terms these outcomes could have a material adverse affect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this report 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

as a result of covid19 our employees globally shifted to working from home beginning in march 2020 while preexisting controls were not specifically designed to operate in our current workfromhome operating environment we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures can be executed effectively and continue to be effective 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2021 based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

as a result of covid19 and as described above we took precautionary actions to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2021 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2021 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls 

can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments 

we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services technologies and intellectual property rights to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our customer 360 platform these evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in recent years notably our acquisition of vlocity in fiscal 2021 which expanded our industryspecific cloud and mobile software solutions and our pending acquisition of slack 

in addition to mergers and acquisitions we invest in earlystage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally to support our business initiatives and enhance our partner ecosystem as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies and investments in emerging markets we plan to continue making these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive 

technology development and operations 

we primarily deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application 

instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other this approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings 

we have historically provided and continue to provide our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center facilities in combination with these thirdparty data center facilities we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer infrastructureasaservice including servers storage databases and networking in december 2020 we announced hyperforce a reimagination of our platform architecture built to securely and reliably deliver the customer 360 platform on major public clouds 

our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services as well as integrating businesses services and technologies from acquisitions performance functional depth security usability ease of integration and configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 

our current competitors include 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality 

• vendors who offer software tailored to specific services that are more directed toward those specific services than our full suite of service offerings 

• suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products as well as business analytics software companies 

• integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions 

• marketing vendors which may specialize in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation 

• ecommerce solutions from established and emerging cloudonly vendors and established onpremises vendors and 

• traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services 

we believe more traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors may become a greater competitive threat as they continue to shift more of their focus to cloud computing service offerings and customer experience management solutions 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019 in addition we do not have any material dependencies on any specific product service or particular group or groups

human capital management 

salesforce is committed to a core set of values trust customer success innovation and equality these core values are the foundation of our company culture which we believe is fundamental to and a competitive advantage in our approach to managing our workforce we believe our company culture fosters open dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent which is critical for our continued success for example our sales engineering and customer success teams are critical to our ability to grow innovate and ensure the trust and customer success of our customers 

we believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective our focus on our workplace environment and a strong company culture has led to recognition across the globe as evidenced by the following awards fortune world’s most admired companies 2021 and for the seventh year in a row fortune 100 best companies to work 2020 and for the 12th year in a row human rights campaign best places to work for lgbtq equality 2021 and glassdoor employees’ choice best place to work in canada france germany the united kingdom and the united states 2020

equality is a core value at salesforce we aim to create a workplace that reflects the diverse communities we serve and empowers our employees our key equality initiatives include investing in our future leaders inclusive hiring and leadership trainings equal pay for equal work employeeled resource groups and a focus on accessibility in our products and workspaces for example 

• we review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps as of january 31 2021 we had spent more than 12 million since this program began to ensure our global workforce is paid fairly in the united states we also review differences in pay for gender as well as race and ethnicity 

• we aspire to have 50 percent of our us workforce made up of underrepresented groups for the us technology industry “underrepresented groups” which we define as employees who identify as women black latinx indigenous multiracial lesbian gay bisexual trans queer people with disabilities veterans and other groups by fiscal 2024 as of november 2 2020 approximately 47 of our us workforce was made up of underrepresented groups

operational and execution risks 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and have materially affected our operating results and cash flows the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and cash flows remain uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and have materially affected our operating results and cash flows the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results remain uncertain in response to the covid19 pandemic we have cancelled or delayed some customer events and shifted many of them including dreamforce world tours connections tableau conference basecamps and salesforceorg’s higher ed summit to virtualonly experiences we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee and industry events in the future our shift to creating virtual customer employee and industry events may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as or generate the same customer interest opportunities and leads through virtual events as we have historically done through inperson events if we attempt to reintroduce large inperson events we may not be able to do so successfully and our customers may not be able or willing to attend them 

we also temporarily closed all salesforce offices globally this global workfromhome operating environment has caused strain for and has adversely impacted productivity of certain employees and these conditions may persist and harm our business including our future sales and operating results as long as the pandemic continues our employees may be exposed to health risks our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful could expose our employees customers and partners to health risks and us to associated liability and will involve additional financial burdens the covid19 pandemic may have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working this may present risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy and may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business 

moreover the conditions caused by covid19 initially affected customer it spending and may in the future adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services these conditions delayed and may in the future delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions and reduced and may in the future reduce the value or duration of our customers’ subscription contracts and affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

our operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines workfromhome directives and shelterinplace orders these public health measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have impacted our business and results of operations and cash flows for example these measures and related economic effects contributed to certain customers’ reluctance or inability to submit payments to us as well as changes in billing frequency and adversely impacted the effectiveness of outsourced service providers we use to collect payments and these conditions may persist or worsen the extent and duration of these measures could also impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents have resulted in increased internet demand which could cause access issues could affect our ability to develop and support products and services and could cause issues with access to data centers as we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance we may adjust our current policies and practices and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively affect our operations 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic future spikes of covid19 infections resulting in additional preventative measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing and nature of a potential economic recovery impact on our customers and our sales cycles our ability to generate new business leads impact on our customer employee and industry events and effects on our vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted the longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods in addition uncertainty regarding the impact of covid19 on our future operating results and financial condition may result in our taking costcutting measures reducing the level of our capital investments and delaying or canceling the implementation of strategic initiatives any of which may negatively impact our business and reputation if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’ partners’ or customers’ business and productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed the global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided in addition the effects of the covid19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems or authorized access is blocked or disabled our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant reputational harm legal exposure and liabilities or a negative financial impact 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data including financial health and other personal information while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers’ customers data our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following 

• thirdparty attempts to fraudulently induce our employees partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data or it systems or our data or our it systems 

• efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations or nationstates to launch coordinated attacks including distributed denialofservice attacks 

• thirdparty attempts to abuse our marketing advertising or social platforms to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false or misleading 

• cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate or on thirdparty cloudcomputing platform providers 

• vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings 

• vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on 

• vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures including those from acquired companies 

• attacks on or vulnerabilities in the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors partners or customers and 

• employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems 

in addition the changes in our work environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our security measures as well as our ability to address and respond to incidents quickly these risks are mitigated to the extent possible by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies enhanced processes and internal security controls including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks our board of directors audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security as well as periodic updates on cybersecurity events although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security or that a material breach will not occur for example our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following 

• frequent changes to and growth in complexity of the techniques used to breach obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it systems and infrastructure which are generally not recognized until launched against a target and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques 

• the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers which increases the complexity of our it systems 

• the acquisition of new companies requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex it environments 

• authorization by our customers to thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data which may lead to our customers inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers and 

• our limited control over our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of data by thirdparty technology providers which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

in the normal course of business we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents to date such identified security events have not been material or significant to us including to our reputation or business operations or had a material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant additionally as our market presence grows we may face increased risks of cyberattack attempts or security threats 

a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to or the denial of authorized access to our it systems or data or our customers systems or data including intellectual property and proprietary sensitive or other confidential information a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal regulatory and financial exposure and liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities including those arising from thirdparty hardware or software may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware proprietary software and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future such defects could be the result of employee contractor or other thirdparty acts or inaction and could negatively affect our brand and reputation additionally such defects could create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data for example in fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our services for certain customers we determined this disruption did not materially affect our business reputation or financial results but there is no assurance such circumstances could not recur with a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation as a result our services may have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions 

since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make 

warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

any interruptions or delays in services from third parties including data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software hardware and data from a variety of vendors any disruption or damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems or to run our business as we increase our reliance on these thirdparty systems particularly with respect to thirdparty cloud computing platforms our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

for many of our offerings our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real time in a separate facility located elsewhere certain offerings including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions including shelterinplace or similar orders changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic including the covid19 pandemic an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future such as the pending acquisition of slack technologies inc “slack” which was signed in december 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 

acquisitions and other transactions arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all 

• potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment 

• difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services and related costs 

• difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis 

• augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation 

• challenges converting the acquired companys revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues including subscriptionbased revenues and software license revenue as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

• the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

• currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets 

• difficulties in integrating acquired operations technologies services platforms and personnel 

• the inability to obtain or a material delay in obtaining the regulatory approvals including from antitrust or other similar regulatory authorities necessary to complete transactions or to integrate operations or potential remedies imposed by regulatory authorities either as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction such as the global hold separate order issued in connection with our acquisition of tableau by the united kingdom competition  markets authority in fiscal 2020 which order was lifted in fiscal 2020 which may include divestitures ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies 

• failure to fully assimilate integrate or retrain acquired employees which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams 

• differences between our values and those of our acquired companies 

• inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 

• inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business 

• challenges with the acquired companys thirdparty service providers including those that are required for ongoing access to thirdparty data 

• changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition 

• potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products 

• unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology 

• known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses including due to litigation 

• difficulties in managing or potential writeoffs of acquired assets or investments and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers 

• negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets fixed assets and operating lease rightofuse assets 

• the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue 

• challenges relating to the structure of an investment such as governance accountability and decisionmaking conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments 

• difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure 

• additional stockbased compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations 

• delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition 

• ineffective or inadequate controls procedures and policies at the acquired company 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions challenges caused by integrating operations over distance and across different languages cultures and political environments and 

• the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities including a potential onetime income tax payment in connection with the integration of clicksoftware and other acquired israeli entities 

any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations in addition to facilitate acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or 

loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may be impaired by the effects of the covid19 pandemic government actions in light of the pandemic trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the technology sector for example a number of countries including the us and countries in europe and the asiapacific region are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments whether in response to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with increased scrutiny governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature some of which may apply to acquisitions investments or integrations of businesses by us and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we may not complete the acquisition of slack within the time frame we anticipate or at all 

the completion of the acquisition of slack is subject to a number of conditions including receipt of slack stockholder approval expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the hsr act and receipt of other approvals consents or clearances under specified antitrust and foreign investment laws pursuant to the hsr act on february 16 2021 we and slack each received a request for additional information and documentary material often referred to as a “second request” from the antitrust division of the department of justice the “doj” issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the hsr act until 30 days after we and slack have each substantially complied with the second request unless the period for review is extended voluntarily by the parties and the doj or is terminated earlier by the doj we and slack have and will continue to cooperate fully with the doj in its review we continue to anticipate completing the transaction during its fiscal quarter ending july 31 2021 subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement 

the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all for example under certain limited conditions we and slack may elect to terminate the merger agreement which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation a delay in completing the acquisition could cause us to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated time frame which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about the completion of the acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the slack acquisition and the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

we believe that there are significant benefits and synergies that may be realized through combining the products scale and combined enterprise customer bases of salesforce and slack however the efforts to realize these benefits and synergies will be a complex process and may disrupt both companies’ existing operations if not implemented in a timely and efficient manner the full benefits of the acquisition including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay any accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock 

in addition we will be required postclosing to devote significant attention and resources to successfully align our business practices and operations this process may disrupt the businesses and if ineffective would limit the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel particularly through acquisitions which has placed a strain on and in the future may stress the capabilities of our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term whether due to the effects of and financial burdens associated with the covid19 pandemic or otherwise we may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed additionally changes in our work environment and workforce as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our operations the covid19 pandemic may have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working any adjustments made to our current and future office environments or workfromhome policies may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline 

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and mediumsize business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts historically our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees however with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales we have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels mix of customer base decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services 

if customers do not renew their subscriptions do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase our business could be harmed 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in and may in the future result in a reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth and operating results in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure comprises of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent thirdparty organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names “icann” and the internet assigned numbers authority now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future potentially reducing the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

in addition certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content other countries have attempted or are attempting to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on the internet for the delivery of their services additionally the covid19 pandemic has also led to 

quarantines shelterinplace orders and workfromhome directives all of which have increased demands for internet access and may create access challenges these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers increase our risk or add liabilities impede our growth productivity and operational effectiveness result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally include 

• natural disasters acts of war terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies including the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related public health measures and resulting changes to laws and regulations including changes oriented toward protecting local businesses or restricting the movement of our or our customers’ employees 

• localization of our services including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses 

• regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors 

• pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations where we have customers and a balance of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

• foreign currency fluctuations and controls which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results 

• compliance with multiple conflicting ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations including employment tax privacy anticorruption importexport customs antiboycott sanctions and embargoes antitrust data transfer storage and protection and industryspecific laws and regulations including rules related to compliance by our thirdparty resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur 

• liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations including nations with a controlled currency environment which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations 

• vetting and monitoring our thirdparty resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation 

• treatment of revenue from international sources evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

• uncertainty regarding regulation currency tax and operations resulting from the united kingdoms exit from the eu “brexit” on january 31 2020 and possible disruptions in trade the sale of our services and commerce and movement of our people between the united kingdom eu and other locations 

• uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the united states and other governments trade regulations trade wars tariffs other restrictions or other geopolitical events including the evolving relations between the united states and china 

• changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate 

• regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders which grow more complex as we scale expand into new markets and enhance the breadth of our service offerings 

• different pricing environments 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• different or lesser protection of our intellectual property including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property 

• longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties and 

• regional economic and political conditions 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges and we 

may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally moreover restrictions in place in response to the covid19 pandemic have disrupted our operations and our customers’ operations and businesses and this has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our sales efforts 

in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by us a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example in february 2020 keith block resigned as coceo and as a director of the company and in february 2021 mark hawkins resigned as president and chief financial officer of the company such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies our executive officers key management development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business 

the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we are also committed to building a diverse workforce we have experienced significant competition in talent recruitment and retention and may not in the future be successful in our talent recruitment and retention or achieving the diversity goals we have set publicly we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring developing integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers including restrictions imposed in response to the covid19 pandemic these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition equality and a sense of family as our organization grows and expands globally and as employees’ workplace expectations develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture these difficulties may be further amplified by workfromhome requirements imposed and other workforce actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic our inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings outsourced provision of technical support may be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen events for example as occurred when certain business process outsourced service providers were delayed in effectively servicing our customers due to conditions related to the covid19 pandemic increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

strategic and industry risks 

our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate in addition the markets for certain of our offerings including workcom customer 360 truth and other offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts and related investments will ever result in significant revenue for us in addition we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades such as our introduction of hyperforce in fiscal 2021 may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customers administrators and developers as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues in addition because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technologies as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely additionally changes to our work environment and workforce as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our ability to timely develop enhancements to and new features for existing or new services our efforts to quickly introduce new offerings designed to help our customers respond to the covid19 pandemic including our workcom offering may not be successful 

furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies including hyperforce or modifications to existing platforms or technologies including text messaging capabilities or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed including associations with trust customer success innovation and equality have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength particularly for our core services will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features securely reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers’ success even as we scale and expand our services in order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands we may make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services or enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful 

in addition we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties such as office towers and a transit center and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand 

further entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands if we fail to maintain enhance or protect our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies could negatively impact our financial results 

we have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in both domestic and international markets including in emerging markets these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore they are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment likewise the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market conditions and to a lesser extent on liquidity events the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

the rapid spread of covid19 and its reverberating effects on the global economy have caused disruptions to our industry to the industries in which our portfolio companies operate and to financial markets these disruptions are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of our portfolio companies to meet their performance targets raise fundraising rounds or complete a liquidity event in some cases our portfolio companies may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced revenues or profitability increased customer attrition delayed cancelled or unsuccessful public offerings reduced ability to raise additional rounds of financing reduced acquisition offers or acquisition offers on unfavorable terms reduced valuations in both private and public markets or insolvency and bankruptcy these outcomes could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem has matured the opportunities in which we can invest have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with an initial public offering in addition to our investments in earlytolatestage private companies therefore our investment strategy and portfolio have also expanded to include more mature companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a period of time after a public offering including market standoff agreements and lockup agreements 

we record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations as a result we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time for example some of our investments in publicly traded securities may be subject to lockup agreements which would prevent our ability to sell these investments after a public offering or otherwise impede our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities volatility in the financial markets including the impact of the covid19 pandemic has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio 

all of our investments especially our investments in privately held companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital in addition in the future we may deploy material investments in individual investee companies resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements 

if thirdparty developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services or if our customers seek warranties from us for thirdparty applications integrations data and content our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of thirdparty developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations data and content that are complementary to our services without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations data and content both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive which could impact future sales in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security or 

integrity of the data access transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our reputation and our business 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

our current competitors include 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality 

• vendors who offer software tailored to specific services that are more directed toward those specific services than our full suite of service offerings 

• suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products as well as business analytics software companies 

• integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions 

• marketing vendors which may specialize in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation 

• ecommerce solutions from established and emerging cloudonly vendors and established onpremises vendors and 

• traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services 

in addition we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories more significant installed bases broader geographic scope broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical personnel and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers’ demands these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing as a result even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business 

social and ethical issues including the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability 

positions we take on social and ethical issues may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers which has in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain customers we also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to these positions further actions taken by our customers including through the use or misuse of our products may result in reputational harm or possible liability for example we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties although we believe that such claims lack merit such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings as with many innovations ai and our customer 360 platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business for example the development of ai and customer 360 the latter of which provides information regarding our customers’ customers presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on 

human rights privacy employment or in other social contexts we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability data practices by us or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions this in turn could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm 

our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability equality and ethical use and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could harm our reputation or brand and could adversely impact our relationships with our customers our disclosures on these matters and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards may influence our reputation and the value of our brand for example we have elected to share publicly certain information about our corporate environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives and our commitment to the recruitment of a diverse workforce our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities including from the investment community and our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth 

legal and regulatory risks 

privacy concerns and laws such as the forthcoming california privacy rights act the california consumer privacy act and the european union’s general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy cybersecurity data protection data sovereignty and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data generally in some cases data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” that took effect in may 2018 impose obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor as well as on many of our customers in addition new domestic data privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 and the california privacy rights act which will amend the ccpa in january 2023 similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers potentially as both businesses and service providers these laws continue to evolve and as various states introduce similar proposals we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens further laws and legislative proposals such as the eu’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities 

although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance including as a result of penalties fines and lawsuits related to data breaches these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some cases impact our ability or our customers ability to offer our services in certain locations to deploy our solutions to reach current and prospective customers or to derive insights from customer data globally for example on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield framework one of the mechanisms that allowed companies including salesforce to transfer personal data from the european economic area “eea” to the united states in addition the cjeu commented that companies relying on another such mechanism the european commission’s standard contractual clauses should assess on a casebycase basis whether the law of the country of destination ensures adequate protection of personal data transferred under eu law by providing where necessary additional safeguards to those offered by those clauses salesforce relies upon binding corporate rules a third mechanism which provides additional safeguards with respect to government requests for eu personal data as well as the european commission’s standard contractual clauses to transfer eu personal data internationally depending on how the cjeu’s decision is enforced the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase based on draft recommendations issued by the european data protection board “edpb” a body of privacy regulators from across the eu charged with ensuring consistent application of gdpr current indications are that absent agreement on a new bilateral crossborder transfer mechanism to replace the euus privacy shield framework regulators may be inclined to interpret the decision as significantly restricting certain crossborder transfers certain countries outside of the eea eg russia china and india have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency by way of further example statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under ccpa and potentially other states laws may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers and our customers customers lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business in addition we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations including through private actions for alleged noncompliance which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation for example in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a dutch privacy advocacy group on behalf of certain dutch citizens that claims we violated the gdpr and dutch telecommunications act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our audience studio and data studio products we were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the uk although we believe that these claims lack merit these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

furthermore the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate particularly in regard to covid19related data processing may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity which may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively in addition new products we develop in connection with changing events such as in response to the covid19 pandemic may expose us to liability or regulatory risk even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry “pci” data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

further in some cases industryspecific regionallyspecific or productspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results this impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” and related federal communication commission orders which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained we have been and may in the future be subject to one or more classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights as well as commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour antitrust data privacy and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we have also been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers including through the use or misuse of our products for example we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties although we believe that such claims lack merit such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability 

our exposure to risks associated with various claims including claims related to the use of intellectual property as well as securities and related stockholder derivative claims may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against tableau that remain outstanding and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs additionally we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies in addition third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims or lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results including our operating cash flow in a particular period in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many us patents and pending us and international patent applications we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties similar uncertainty applies to our us and international trademark registrations and applications furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us and elsewhere effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries’ intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others’ rights the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standardsetting activity our contribution to open source projects various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us cause us to divert time and resources from our core business and harm our business 

lawsuits were filed against slack salesforce and the members of the slack board in connection with the mergers and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the mergers andor substantial costs to salesforce 

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition merger or other business combination agreements like the merger agreement even if such a lawsuit is without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources an adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition 

after the mergers were announced seven lawsuits were filed by purported slack stockholders in the united states district court for the northern district of california and six lawsuits were filed by purported slack stockholders in the united states district court for the southern district of new york each in connection with the mergers the complaints named as defendants slack the members of the slack board and with respect to three of the actions salesforce and alleged among other things that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement relating to the proposed mergers to be filed with the sec in violation of sections 14a and 20a of the exchange act and rule 14a9 promulgated thereunder and that slack’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the mergers on february 22 2021 slack filed a current report on form 8k in which it voluntarily made supplemental disclosures relating to the proposed mergers by march 3 2021 all thirteen of the pending cases had been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 

one of the conditions to the closing of the mergers is that no injunction by any governmental entity having jurisdiction over salesforce or slack has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted in either case that prohibits the closing of the mergers consequently if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the mergers that injunction may delay or prevent the mergers from being completed within the expected time frame or at all which may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any lawsuits filed in connection with the mergers the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the mergers are completed may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause and termination of any such contract may adversely impact our other existing or prospective government contracts any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls where we conduct our business activities including the us commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with applicable trade laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of trade privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining necessary authorizations including any required licenses may be timeconsuming require expenditure of corporate resources is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and parties even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in trade regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations import and export control regulations in the us and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty including as a result of geopolitical developments relations between the united states and china and the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

financial risks 

because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods including changes resulting from the effects of the covid19 pandemic our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 

due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations and unanticipated events such as the covid19 pandemic may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or at all without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and in some periods we have not been able to and may not be able in the future to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in operations changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws any changes ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state local or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles or changes to our business operations including as a result of acquisitions any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position 

as our business continues to grow increasing our brand recognition and profitability we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes which may impact our cash flows and financial results furthermore our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile and if perceived negatively may cause brand or reputational harm 

as we utilize our tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years which could have a material impact to our future cash flows in addition changes to our operating structure including changes related to acquisitions may result in cash tax obligations 

global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business cash flow from operating activities or financial results such developments for example include the organization for economic cooperation and development’s the european commission’s and certain major jurisdictions heightened interest in and taxation of companies participating in the digital economy governments’ responses to the economic impact of covid19 may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the british pound sterling 

we primarily conduct our business in the following regions the americas europe and asia pacific the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets including in emerging markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in euro british pound sterling japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar as well as the euro against the british pound sterling these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings additionally global events including the sudden and unexpected effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as geopolitical developments fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments have caused and may in the future cause global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

our debt service obligations lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as of january 31 2021 we had a substantial level of debt including our 2023 and 2028 senior notes senior notes” and the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 fremont due june 2023 in december 2020 we entered into a credit agreement the “revolving loan credit agreement” which provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” that matures in december 2025 replacing our previous revolving credit facility of 10 billion there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of january 31 2021 we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include without limitation financing the consideration for and fees costs and expenses related to any acquisition in addition in connection with our pending acquisition of slack in december 2020 we obtained a 364day senior unsecured bridge loan facility “bridge facility” the original commitments in respect of the bridge facility were 100 billion but were reduced to 70 billion in december 2020 following our entry into a 30 billion threeyear senior unsecured loan agreement “acquisition term loan” in february 2021 we elected to further reduce our bridge facility commitments to 40 billion the availability and funding of the bridge facility and the acquisition term loan are conditioned on the consummation of the acquisition of slack in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and are subject to certain exceptions qualifications and other conditions we expect to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the acquisition with the incurrence of new indebtedness or commitments in respect thereof 

in addition to the outstanding and contemplated debt obligations above we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our longterm lease agreements we also have significant other contractual commitments such as commitments with infrastructure service providers which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 

maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments and 

• make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business our industry or the economy in general such as recent downturns in connection with the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to 

service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business in addition we may seek debt financing to fund future acquisitions following the slack acquisition we can offer no assurance that we can obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

in addition adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit facilities may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

lease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease these options are reflected in the operating lease rightofuse rou asset which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option we reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control the potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we may be required to change our accounting policies to alter our operational policies to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards and to adjust our published financial statements such changes may have an adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets which may negatively impact our financial results 

in addition as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” the sustainability accounting standards board “sasb” and our own esg materiality assessment we have expanded and in the future may continue to expand our disclosures in these areas our failure to report accurately or achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth 

risks related to owning our common stock 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks including the sudden and unanticipated effects of the covid19 pandemic in addition our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter this trend has been adversely impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related economic downturn and uncertainties 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

• general economic or geopolitical conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which can adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services or delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect attrition rates 

• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements 

• the attrition rates for our services 

• the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force 

• the length of the sales cycle for our services 

• new product and service introductions by our competitors 

• our success in selling our services to large enterprises 

• changes in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation due to seasonality the timing of and compounding effects of renewals invoice duration size and timing new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter average contract term the collectability of invoices related to multiyear agreements the timing of license software revenue recognition or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements all of which may impact implied growth rates 

• our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships acquisitions or investments 

• variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an onpremise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront 

• the seasonality of our sales cycle including software license sales and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time 

• changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts whether initiated by us or as a result of competition customer preference or other factors 

• changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers as have been and may continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• the seasonality of our customers’ businesses especially our commerce service offering customers including retailers and branded manufacturers 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business 

• the number of new employees 

• the timing of commission bonus and other compensation payments to employees including decisions to guarantee some portion of commissions payments in connection with extraordinary events such as the partial commission guarantee in the fiscal quarter ended april 30 2020 

• the cost timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services 

• the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the followon costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses 

• expenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate including our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion 

• timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services 

• expenses related to significant unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur including for example expenses related to the covid19 pandemic 

• extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other disputerelated settlement payments 

• income tax effects resulting from but not limited to tax law changes court decisions on tax matters global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity 

• the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock options 

• technical difficulties or interruptions in our services 

• changes in interest rates and our mix of investments which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities 

• conditions and particularly sudden changes in the financial markets such as the recent volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic which have impacted and may continue to impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio 

• changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in earlytolatestage privately held and public companies which could negatively and materially impact our financial results particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations 

• equity or debt issuances including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions 

• the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straightline basis over their vesting schedules 

• evolving regulations of cloud computing and crossborder data transfer restrictions and similar regulations 

• regulatory compliance and acquisition costs and 

• the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet the market price of our common stock could decline in addition if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

• variations in our operating results earnings per share cash flows from operating activities unearned revenue remaining performance obligation yearoveryear growth rates for individual service offerings and other financial metrics and nonfinancial metrics such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics and how those results compare to analyst expectations 

• variations in and limitations of the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business 

• forwardlooking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to for example future revenue current remaining performance obligation cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors many of which are beyond our control including general economic and market conditions and unanticipated delays in the integration of acquired companies as a result of regulatory review 

• our ability to meet or exceed forwardlooking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors analysts or others our ability to give forwardlooking guidance consistent with past practices and changes to or withdrawal of previous guidance or longrange targets including due to uncertainty in connection with effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock 

• announcements of technological innovations new services or service enhancements strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors 

• announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors 

• announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases 

• the coverage of our common stock by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs

• the issuance of shares of common stock by us whether in connection with an acquisition or a capitalraising transaction 

• issuance of debt or other convertible securities 

• changes to our credit ratings and 

• environmental social governance and other issues impacting our reputation 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market including debt offerings in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation such as securities litigation against tableau that was brought before we acquired that company such litigation whether against salesforce or an acquired subsidiary could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

• permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan also known as a “poison pill” 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

general risks 

volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in connection with the covid19 pandemic and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can arise suddenly as did the conditions associated with the covid19 pandemic and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict in addition geopolitical and domestic political developments such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets as has been the case with the covid19 pandemic and relations between the united states and china moreover these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of it spending could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services have delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts and we expect these conditions will adversely affect our customer attrition rates all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shutoffs or shortages actual or threatened public health emergencies including the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other events beyond our control for example in response to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed our offices globally including our corporate headquarters and are experiencing and expect to continue to experience ongoing effects related to the local and global economic and other effects of this 

pandemic although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our personnel research and development activities it systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event such as the covid19 pandemic for example wildfires have resulted in power shutoffs in the san francisco bay area and are likely to occur in the future and this could adversely affect the workfromhome operations of our employees in the san francisco bay area 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climaterelated risks we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our california headquarters have historically experienced and are projected to continue to experience climaterelated events at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention furthermore it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees while they work from home as a result of the covid19 pandemic changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our thirdparty suppliers and the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations

 item 2 properties 

as of january 31 2021 our executive and principal offices for sales marketing professional services development and administration consisted of approximately 18 million square feet of leased and owned property in san francisco excluded from this amount is approximately 362000 square feet in san francisco that is currently sublet as well as approximately 297000 square feet in san francisco currently available for sublease as we began consolidating and subleasing additional real estate leases in fiscal 2021 

we also lease office space for our operations in various locations throughout the united states as well as office space in a number of countries in europe north america asia south america africa and australia 

we operate data centers in the us europe and asia pursuant to various colocation lease arrangements 

we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements if we require additional space we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable commercially reasonable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements

overview 

we are a global leader in customer relationship management crm technology that brings companies and customers together with our customer 360 platform we deliver a single source of truth connecting customer data across systems apps and devices to help companies sell service market and conduct commerce from anywhere since our founding in 1999 we have pioneered innovations in cloud mobile social analytics and artificial intelligence “ai” enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the alldigital workfromanywhere era 

covid19 impact 

in december 2019 the novel coronavirus and resulting disease “covid19” was first reported after ongoing assessment of the rapid spread number of cases and countries affected on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have been guided by our core values of trust customer success innovation and equality beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal 2021 we took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity supporting our employees helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and the longterm success of our business 

as a result of the pandemic we experienced a slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same prioryear period however new business grew during the remainder of fiscal 2021 at rates consistent with historical trends prior to covid19 in addition as a result of actions taken by us in response to the pandemic we experienced incremental operating expenses and lower than expected operating cash flows for the full year of fiscal 2021 when compared to historical trends for example changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our gotomarket efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the year in fiscal 2021 our income from operations benefited from our global work from home policy and limited business travel by our employees we continue to evaluate our office space needs and as a result we recorded approximately 216 million of impairments to assets associated with real estate 

leases in select locations we have decided to exit of which approximately 184 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

in addition we have in the past implemented strategic realignments to position our company for future growth and will continue to do so particularly as we evaluate the impact of covid19 on our business as part of our current strategic realignment we have redirected and may in the future redirect some resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas as well as to increase investments in our gotomarket and product efforts as a result of these investments and redirection efforts which included some position eliminations we saw an increase in expenses in fiscal 2021 in addition as we continue to evaluate our office space needs we may record additional impairments to associated assets as we adjust and refine our strategy there may be additional investments and redirection efforts in the future 

we do not yet know the impact the pandemic will have on our longterm revenue growth and profitability authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines workfromhome directives and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and could continue to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide these business slowdowns and shutdowns have impacted and may continue to impact our business and results of operations for example the extent and duration of these measures could impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents have resulted in increased internet demand which could cause access issues could affect our ability to develop and support products and services and could cause issues with access to data centers 

the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance depends on certain developments including the duration of the pandemic and any resurgences the severity of the disease responsive actions taken by public health officials the development distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines the impacts on our customers and our sales cycles our ability to generate new business leads the impacts on our customers employee and industry events and the effects on our vendors all of which are uncertain and currently cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty as a result the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain due to our primarily subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’ partners’ or customers’ productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed in addition the global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided 

see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

highlights from the fiscal year 2021 

• revenue total fiscal 2021 revenue was 213 billion an increase of 24 percent yearoveryear 

• earnings per share  fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share was 438 as compared to earnings per share of 015 from a year ago and was benefited by approximately 20 billion from the onetime discrete tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intraentity transfer of intangible property and an unrealized gain of 17 billion associated with the initial public offerings of two of our strategic investments 

• cash cash provided by operations for fiscal 2021 was 48 billion an increase of 11 percent yearoveryear total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities ended fiscal 2021 at 120 billion 

• remaining performance obligation  remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately 361 billion an increase of 17 percent yearoveryear current remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately 180 billion an increase of 20 percent yearoveryear 

• acquisition during fiscal 2021 we completed the acquisition of vlocity inc vlocity for 14 billion consisting primarily of 12 billion in cash additionally during fiscal 2021 we announced our pending acquisition of slack technologies inc “slack” a leading channelbased messaging platform which is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals for an estimated 156 billion in cash and 45 million shares of salesforce common stock based on slack class a and class b shares outstanding as of january 31 2021 

we continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key growth levers including driving multicloud adoption increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industryspecific reach with more vertical software solutions these growth drivers often require a more sophisticated gotomarket approach and as a result we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue as a result we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics have lower attrition rates than our company average 

we plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions we regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings past acquisitions have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions in new categories including analytics and integration we continue to evaluate investment opportunities and expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future such as our pending acquisition of slack slack has an integrated value proposition across all of our service offerings and upon close of the transaction and successful product integration we believe it will further enable companies to grow and succeed in an alldigital workfromanywhere era 

as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income 

we periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for longterm growth which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity in addition we have experienced and may at times in the future experience more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions and increased enterprise solution selling activities slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods particularly if experienced on a sustained basis 

the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets including as a result of covid19 expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on our revenue results for fiscal 2021 in addition fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on both our remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation as of january 31 2021 we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2021 for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2021 

operating segments 

we operate as one segment see note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources subscription and support revenues and related professional services subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2021 

subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services collectively cloud services cloud services allow customers to use our multitenant software without taking possession of the software revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support are generally recognized ratably over the contract term changes in contract duration for multiyear licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2021 

the revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings as described below in “results of operations” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time additionally we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and as a result the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter in addition some of our cloud service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use our sales service or platform service offering to record account and contact information which are similar features across these service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage 

our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers we calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelvemonth basis as of the end of each month as of january 31 2021 our attrition rate excluding our integration service offering salesforceorg and tableau 

was between 90 and 95 prior to fiscal year 2021 our attrition rate excluded our commerce service offering in general we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization while our attrition rate is difficult to predict we expect it to remain consistent or slightly better in the near term due to the diversity of size industry and geography within the customer base however our attrition rate may increase over time including for example as a result of covid19 

we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues 

seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearonyear compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter conversely our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter in response to covid19 we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and changed billing frequencies for other customers throughout fiscal 2021 which has delayed payments to periods later than expected we also have accelerated our investments in our gotomarket and product efforts throughout fiscal 2021 which resulted in increased expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flow these efforts have affected and may continue to affect trends related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenues accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions for example operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below in millions 

remaining performance obligation 

our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months 

remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors including seasonality the timing of renewals average contract terms foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increase if the agreement is renewed low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer changes in contract duration can impact remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation 

remaining performance obligation consisted of the following in billions 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions including our acquisition of vlocity in june 2020 and our acquisition of tableau in august 2019 expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support including the costs of data center capacity certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data and employeerelated costs such as salaries and benefits 

cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and certain thirdparty fees we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and allocated overhead 

marketing and sales   

marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and commissions for our sales and marketing staff as well as payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities we capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts such as commissions and amortize these costs on a straightline basis payments of these commissions are not consistent with the period in which the expense is recognized 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition  contracts with multiple performance obligations we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services software licenses premium support and professional services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment 

cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately in determining whether professional services are distinct we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct 

we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where services are sold price lists our gotomarket strategy historical sales and contract prices in instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to ssp 

in certain cases we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices if ssp is not directly observable for example when pricing is highly variable we use a range of ssp we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography 

costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straightline basis over four years which although longer than the typical initial contract period reflects the average period of benefit including expected contract renewals significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit therefore we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are 

• future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts professional services contracts other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents 

• historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers 

• assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings 

• discount rates 

• uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed 

• fair value of assumed equity awards and 

• fair value of preexisting relationships 

unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

in fiscal 2021 we changed our international corporate structure which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of 20 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible property we made significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projected revenues operating expenses and geographic earnings mix in the valuation models we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and will regularly evaluate its realizability 

strategic investments accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 

valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available as adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold 

we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics market acceptance of the product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is considered to be impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment 

the particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company as a result our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of january 31 2021 could result in a 66 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated in millions 



1 amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations as follows in millions 



2 amounts related to stockbased expenses as follows in millions 



3 during fiscal 2021 two of our strategic investments completed their initial public offering resulting in an unrealized gain of 17 billion as of january 31 2021

the following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated in millions except remaining performance obligation which is presented in billions 



1 amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations 

remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods 

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 compared to the same period of fiscal 2020 was impacted by our acquisitions in the current and prior year including the acquisition of tableau in the prior year which was our largest acquisition to date in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2020 we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the fiscal year subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

fiscal year ended january 31 2021 and 2020 

revenues 



the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity pricing was 

not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period revenues from term and perpetual software licenses which are recognized at a point in time represent approximately six percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2021 subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately 15 billion and 652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively and is included in the above amounts as a result of our business combination activity we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity 

the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

subscription and support revenue by service offering 

subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



our industry offerings revenue is included in either sales service or platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased subscription and support revenues from platform and other benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of tableau in fiscal 2021 as compared to six months in fiscal 2020 the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings have been and may be impacted by covid19 in the future depending on our customers’ actual and projected business needs for example we experienced increased demand for our marketing and commerce service offering for fiscal 2021 when compared to prior periods 

revenues by geography were as follows  



revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity which may be different than the region of the customer the increase in americas revenues was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services and the investment of additional sales resources the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international sales resources revenues in the americas and europe also benefited from our acquisition of tableau in august 2019 foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2021 and 2020 

cost of revenues 



for fiscal 2021 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of 330 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 37 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 275 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 222 million and an increase in third party fees and allocated overhead service delivery costs associated with our perpetual and term software licenses are lower than service delivery costs associated with our cloud service offerings and as a result our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2021 benefited in part due to this shift in our business mix 

we have increased our headcount associated with our data centers customer support and professional services by 18 percent since fiscal 2020 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

operating expenses 



for fiscal 2021 the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 508 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 193 million in stockbased expenses and increases in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead our research and development headcount increased by 11 percent since fiscal 2020 in order to improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

for fiscal 2021 the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of 14 billion in employeerelated costs and amortization of deferred commissions an increase of 89 million in stockbased expenses an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 107 million and allocated overhead partially offset by a reduction in employee travel and expenses marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2021 were also negatively impacted by the onetime partial minimum commission guarantee offered to our direct sales force our marketing and sales headcount increased by 14 percent since fiscal 2020 primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel we also expect an increase in marketing and sales expenses due to the gradual increase of travel and related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2022 

for fiscal 2021 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs as well as being impacted by our charitable donations to members of our ecosystem and community our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since fiscal 2020 as we added personnel to support our growth while not material to date we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid19 pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessments 

as a result of the june 2019 salesforceorg business combination we effectively settled all existing agreements between ourselves and salesforceorg and as part of business combination accounting accordingly recorded a onetime noncash operating expense charge of approximately 166 million in fiscal 2020 related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement 

other income and expense 



gains on strategic investments net consists primarily of marktomarket adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments net gains recognized during fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded equity securities of 17 billion and realized gains on sales of equity securities of 04 billion 

other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income interest expense was 126 million and 131 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively investment income decreased 34 million in fiscal 2021 respectively compared to the same period a year ago due to lower interest rates across our portfolio modestly offset by larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances upon closing of our acquisition of slack we expect an increase in interest expense due to debt agreements we plan to enter into in connection with the pending acquisition 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



in fiscal 2021 we recognized a tax benefit of 15 billion on a pretax income of 26 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we changed our international corporate structure which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of 20 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value the determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management the tax amortization related to the intellectual property transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under irish tax laws the deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted irish tax rate we believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in ireland 

in fiscal 2020 we recognized a tax provision of 580 million on a pretax income of 706 million our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states

foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada latin america asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets including emerging markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion costs associated with thirdparty infrastructure providers additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and brazilian real against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including market impacts associated with covid19 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

in fiscal 2020 we began transitioning away from our ukcentralized european structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe including germany and france to invoice customers directly this transition which may take multiple years is expected to enable local subsidiaries to recognize revenues operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies with the change to local invoicing in some markets we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency 

in january 2020 the uk exited the european union “eu” “brexit” in december 2020 a trade agreement was entered into between the uk and the eu and in january 2021 the transition period ended and the uk was no longer subject to eu rules or regulations brexit and the new ukeu trade agreement could adversely affect the uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound sterling and euro we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations in fiscal 2021 and 2020 revenues generated in europe were approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total revenues respectively of which most are recorded in our uk germany france italy spain and ireland subsidiaries revenues in europe had a minimal favorable impact in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of fluctuations in the euro and british pound sterling against the usd we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer accounts receivable intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies throughout the year the amounts of revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during fiscal 2020 using a constant currency rate however fluctuations in usd against certain international currencies over the past several months modestly benefited our remaining performance obligation as of january 31 2021 compared to what we would have reported as of january 31 2020 using constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 120 billion as of january 31 2021 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixedrate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses 

our fixedincome portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at january 31 2021 could result in a 63 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 79 billion changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 38 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in addition we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk as follows in millions 



1 maturity date will be 364 days following the closing of the pending slack acquisition 

2 maturity date is three years following the closing of the pending slack acquisition 

any borrowings under the bridge facility will bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0875 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time and subject to increases of 025 on each of the 90th 180th and 270th day following the initial funding of the bridge facility as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amounts under the bridge facility 

any borrowings under our acquisition term loan bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0125 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time our acquisition term loan allows for the libor rate to be phased out and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the acquisition term loan 

the borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0125 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 050 to 1125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating our credit facility allows for the libor rate to be phased out and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts as of january 31 2021 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our 

counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally including in emerging markets we primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies technology startups and system integrators to advance and expand our ecosystem as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies we plan to continue these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive our strategy includes using proceeds from realized gains recognized on the sales of our existing strategic investments to in part fund these new strategic investments 

as of january 31 2021 our portfolio consisted of investments in over 280 companies with capital investments ranging from less than 03 million to approximately 335 million and 40 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately 10 million as of january 31 2021 we held one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investments one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was greater than 15 percent of our total strategic investments and one privately held investment with a carrying value greater than five percent of our strategic investment portfolio 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of january 31 2021 and excludes exited investments in millions 



we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices observable price changes and impairments to our investments these changes could be material based on market conditions and events while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio volatility in the global market conditions including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of covid19 and related public health measures may impact our investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations 

our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences the particular securities we hold and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company as a result our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our publicly traded and significant privately held equity securities held as of january 31 2021 which represents 74 percent of the strategic investment portfolio could result in a 272 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment 

we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering one of our publicly traded investments which individually had a carrying value of approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investment portfolio is subject to lockup agreements until march 2021 for the investment made prior to their initial public offering “ipo” and september 2021 for the investment made concurrent with their ipo a portion of our holdings was released from the lockup agreement early as certain criteria were met 

in addition the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment all of our investments particularly those in privately held companies are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital the rapid spread of covid19 and its reverberating effects on the global economy have caused disruptions to the industry and to financial markets that are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of investee companies to complete a liquidity event in severe cases our investee companies may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced profitability delayed public offerings reduced ability to raise favorable rounds of financing or acquisitions at less favorable 

terms these outcomes could have a material adverse affect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this report 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

as a result of covid19 our employees globally shifted to working from home beginning in march 2020 while preexisting controls were not specifically designed to operate in our current workfromhome operating environment we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures can be executed effectively and continue to be effective 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2021 based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

as a result of covid19 and as described above we took precautionary actions to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2021 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2021 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls 

can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 

our current competitors include 

table of contents 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations stockholders equity cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems or authorized access is blocked or disabled our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant reputational harm legal exposure and liabilities or a negative financial impact 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data including financial information and personally identifiable information while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers’ customers data our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following 

• thirdparty attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data our data or our it systems 

• efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates 

• cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate 

table of contents 

• vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings 

• vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on 

• vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures including those from newly acquired companies 

• attacks on or vulnerabilities in the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors partners or customers and 

• employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems 

these risks are mitigated to the extent possible by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies enhanced processes and internal security controls including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks our board of directors audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security as well as periodic updates on cybersecurity events although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security for example our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following 

• frequent changes to and growth in complexity of the techniques used to breach obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it systems and infrastructure which are generally not recognized until launched against a target possibly resulting in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques 

• the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers which increases the complexity of our it systems 

• authorization by our customers to thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data which may lead to our customers inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers and 

• our limited control over our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of data by thirdparty technology providers which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

in the normal course of business we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents to date such identified security events have not been material or significant to us including to our reputation or business operations or had a material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant 

a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to or the denial of authorized access to our it systems or data or our customers systems or data including intellectual property and proprietary sensitive or other confidential information a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities including those arising from thirdparty hardware or software may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware proprietary software and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data for example in fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our services for certain customers as a precaution we immediately disabled access to our services for potentially impacted customers while we worked to remediate the issue upon completion of the evaluation of the cause and impact of the disruption we determined it did not materially affect our business reputation or financial results 

in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our 

table of contents 

brand and reputation as a result our services may have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions 

since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

any interruptions or delays in services from thirdparties including data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software hardware and data from a variety of vendors any disruption or damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future in addition the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems or to run our business as we increase our reliance on these thirdparty systems our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

for many of our offerings our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near realtime in a separate facility located elsewhere certain offerings including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our business as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

privacy concerns and laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the european union’s general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy cybersecurity data protection data sovereignty and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data generally in some cases data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s eu general data protection regulation gdpr that took effect in may 2018 impose obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor as well as on many of our customers in addition new domestic data privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers potentially as both businesses and service providers as the ccpa continues to evolve and various states introduce similar proposals we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens further laws and legislative proposals such as the eu’s proposed eprivacy 

table of contents 

regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities 

although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments such as gdpr and ccpa readiness these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance including as a result of data breaches these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some cases impact our ability or our customers ability to offer our services in certain locations to deploy our solutions to reach current and prospective customers or to derive insights from customer data globally for example ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support crossborder data transfers such as the euus and swissus privacy shield framework additionally certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency by way of further example statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under ccpa and potentially other states laws may increase our and our customers potential liability and the demands our customers place on us the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers and our customers customers lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

furthermore the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market such as with analytics and integration may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate in addition the markets for certain of our offerings including einstein analytics and voice blockchain and other offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts and related investments will ever result in significant revenue for us in addition we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customers administrators and developers as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues in addition because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technologies as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore 

table of contents 

uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions and other transactions arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all 

• potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment 

• difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services and related costs 

• difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis 

• augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation 

• challenges converting the acquired companys revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues including subscriptionbased revenues and software license revenue as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

• the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

• currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets 

• difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations technologies services platforms and personnel 

• the inability to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete transactions or to integrate operations or potential remedies imposed by regulatory authorities either as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction such as the review of our tableau acquisition by the united kingdom competition  markets authority which was completed in fiscal 2020 which may include divestitures ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies 

• failure to assimilate acquired employees which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams 

• difficulties in retraining key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture 

• differences between our values and those of our acquired companies 

• inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 

• inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business 

• challenges with the acquired companys thirdparty service providers including those that are required for ongoing access to thirdparty data 

• changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition 

• potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products 

• unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses 

table of contents 

• potential writeoffs of acquired assets or investments and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers 

• negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets fixed assets and deferred compensation 

• the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue 

• challenges relating to the structure of an investment such as governance accountability and decisionmaking conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments 

• difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure 

• additional stockbased compensation including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations 

• delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition 

• ineffective or inadequate controls procedures and policies at the acquired company 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions challenges caused by integrating operations over distance and across different languages cultures and political environments and 

• the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities 

any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations in addition to facilitate acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

further in some cases industryspecific laws regionallyspecific or productspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results this impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” and related federal communication commission “fcc” orders which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained we have been and may in the future be subject to one or more classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel particularly through acquisitions which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

our current competitors include 

• vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through onpremises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers either individually or with others 

• internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ it departments 

• software companies that provide their product or service free of charge and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality 

• suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products as well as business analytics software companies 

• integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions 

• marketing vendors which may be specialized in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation 

• ecommerce solutions from established and emerging cloudonly vendors and established onpremises vendors 

• traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services 

• iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies and 

• ai solutions from new startups and established companies 

in addition we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories significant installed bases broader geographic scope and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical personnel and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers demands these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing as a result even if our services are more 

table of contents 

effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed including that of trust customer success innovation and equality have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features securely reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers success in order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands we may make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful 

in addition we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties such as office towers and a transit center and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand 

if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent thirdparty organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names “icann” and the internet assigned numbers authority “iana” now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet resulting in multiple separate internets these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

in addition certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers impede our growth result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies could negatively impact our financial results 

we have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment likewise the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market conditions and to a lesser extent on liquidity events the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem has matured the opportunities in which we can invest have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with an initial public offering in addition to our investments in early to late stage private companies therefore our investment strategy and portfolio has also expanded to include more mature companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a period of time after a public offering including market standoff agreements and lockup agreements 

we record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations as a result we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be 

table of contents 

impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time this volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio 

all of our investments especially our investments in privately held companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital in addition in the future we may deploy material investments in individual investee companies resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements 

• the attrition rates for our services 

• the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force 

• the length of the sales cycle for our services 

• new product and service introductions by our competitors 

• our success in selling our services to large enterprises 

• changes in unearned revenue and the remaining performance obligation due to seasonality the timing of and compounding effects of renewals invoice duration size and timing new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter average contract term the collectibility of invoices related to multiyear agreements the timing of license software revenue recognition or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements all of which may impact implied growth rates 

• our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships acquisitions or investments 

• general economic or geopolitical conditions which may adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect attrition rates 

• variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an onpremise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront 

• the seasonality of our sales cycle including software license sales and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time 

• changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts whether initiated by us or as a result of competition 

• changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers 

• the seasonality of our customers’ businesses especially commerce cloud customers including retailers and branded manufacturers 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound sterling 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business 

• the number of new employees 

• the timing of commission bonus and other compensation payments to employees 

• the cost timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services 

• the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the followon costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses 

• expenses related to our real estate our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion 

table of contents 

• timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services 

• expenses related to significant unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur 

• extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other disputerelated settlement payments 

• income tax effects resulting from but not limited to tax law changes court decisions on tax matters global tax developments applicable to multinationals changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity 

• the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards 

• technical difficulties or interruptions in our services 

• changes in interest rates and our mix of investments which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities 

• conditions particularly sudden changes in the financial markets which have impacted and may continue to impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio 

• changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in earlytolate stage privately held and public companies which could negatively and materially impact our financial results particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations 

• equity issuances including as consideration in acquisitions 

• the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straightline basis over their vesting schedules 

• evolving regulations of cloud computing and crossborder data transfer restrictions and similar regulations 

• regulatory compliance costs and 

• the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet the market price of our common stock could decline in addition if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or at all without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally include 

• localization of our services including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses 

• regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors 

• pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations where we have customers and a balance of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

table of contents 

• foreign currency fluctuations and controls which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results 

• compliance with multiple conflicting ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations including employment tax privacy anticorruption importexport antitrust data transfer storage and protection and industryspecific laws and regulations including rules related to compliance by our thirdparty resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur 

• liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations including nations with a controlled currency environment which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations 

• vetting and monitoring our thirdparty resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation 

• treatment of revenue from international sources evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

• uncertainty regarding regulation currency tax and operations resulting from the united kingdoms exit from the eu brexit on january 31 2020 and possible disruptions in trade the sale of our services and commerce and movement of our people between the united kingdom eu and other locations 

• uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the united states and other governments trade regulations trade wars tariffs other restrictions or other geopolitical events 

• changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate 

• regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders which grow more complex as we scale and expand into new markets 

• different pricing environments 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• different or lesser protection of our intellectual property including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property 

• longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties 

• natural disasters acts of war terrorism or pandemics including the ongoing coronavirus epidemic and 

• regional economic and political conditions 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term 

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue could decline and our business may suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and 

table of contents 

medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts historically our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees however with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales we have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels mix of customer base decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services 

if customers do not renew their subscriptions do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase our business could be harmed 

if thirdparty developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services or if our customers seek warranties from us for thirdparty applications integrations data and content our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of thirdparty developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations data and content that are complementary to our services without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations data and content both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive which could impact future sales in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the british pound sterling 

we primarily conduct our business in the following regions the americas europe and asia pacific the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling euro japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar as well as the euro against the british pound sterling these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings additionally global political events including brexit and similar geopolitical developments fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain in addition geopolitical developments such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control such as the coronavirus epidemic can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets for example in response to the coronavirus epidemic we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtualonly experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee or industry events in the future moreover these conditions can affect the rate of it spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

table of contents 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a thirdparty our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a thirdparty or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

social and ethical issues including the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability 

social and ethical issues including the use of new and evolving technologies such as ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings as with many innovations ai and our customer 360 platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business for example the development of ai and customer 360 the latter of which provides information regarding our customers’ customers presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights privacy employment or in other social contexts we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability data practices by us or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions this in turn could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm 

in addition positions we take on social and ethical issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers we also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue business with existing customers due to these positions our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability equality and ethical use and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers 

table of contents 

for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many us patents and pending us and international patent applications we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example in february 2020 keith block resigned as coceo and as a director of the company such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring developing integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located if we fail to attract new 

table of contents 

personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family as our organization grows and expands globally and as employees’ workplace expectations develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth and operating results in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and recent global tax developments may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in operations changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws any changes ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles or changes to the business operations including acquisitions any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results of financial positions 

as our business continues to grow increasing our brand recognition and profitability we may be subject to additional public scrutiny and income tax obligations furthermore our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile and if perceived negatively may cause brand or reputational harm 

as we utilize our tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years which could have a material impact to our future cash flows in addition changes to our operating structure including the integration of acquisitions may result in cash tax obligations 

in addition recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business cash flow from operating activities or financial results such developments for example include the organization for economic cooperation and development the european commission and certain major jurisdictions taxation of the digital economy

our debt service obligations lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as of january 31 2020 we had a substantial level of debt including the 2023 and 2028 senior notes senior notes” the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco california “50 fremont” due june 2023 and lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments such as commitments with infrastructure service providers which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in april 2018 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to 10 billion maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments and 

• make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business our industry or the economy in general 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business 

in addition adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

new lease accounting guidance requires that we now record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in an increase in both our assets and liabilities the implementation of this guidance including the increase in operating and finance lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease these options are reflected in the operating lease rightofuse rou asset which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option we reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control the potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics including the ongoing coronavirus epidemic and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our research and development activities it systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business whether for our offices data centers vendors customers or other stakeholders is a priority any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our california headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change climate related events including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on us critical infrastructure have the potential to disrupt our business our thirdparty suppliers or the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we may be required to change our accounting policies to alter our operational policies to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards and to adjust our published financial statements such changes may have an adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets which may negatively impact our financial results 

in addition as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and our own environmental social governance “esg” materiality assessment we may expand our disclosures in these areas this transparency is consistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the economic social and environmental impact we have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy these metrics whether it be the standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these metrics may influence our reputation and the value of our brand our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

by electing to set and share publicly these corporate esg metrics our business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg activities as a result we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls including the commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with these us export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of export or import privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining the necessary authorizations including any required license may be timeconsuming is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore the us export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results

risks related to our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements

we continue to invest for future growth through focusing on multicloud adoption by our existing customers growing our relationships with our enterprise customers expanding internationally and expanding and strengthening our ecosystem of partners and independent software vendors “isvs” as a result we continue to win customers from competitors in the markets in which we compete in addition we continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings providing additional opportunities for growth in our business and results 

we regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings through a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as part of our business and growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including analytics and integration we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions such as our recent business combination with salesforceorg in june 2019 and acquisitions of tableau in august 2019 and clicksoftware in october 2019 

as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income 

we periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for longterm growth which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity in addition we have experienced and may at times in the future experience more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions while we do not expect any of these changes to have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our nearterm or longterm revenue targets slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods particularly if experienced on a sustained basis 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in wuhan china the world health organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a public health emergency of international concern the extent of the impact of the coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak impact on our customers and our sales cycles impact on our customer employee or industry events and effect on our vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted for example in response to the coronavirus epidemic we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtualonly experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee or industry events in the future at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain due to our subscription based business model the effect of the coronavirus may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if at all 

the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue results for fiscal 2020 and had a minimal impact on our remaining performance obligation as of january 31 2020 we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2020 for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2020 

operating segments 

we operate as one segment see note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments 

table of contents 

adoption of new accounting standards 

we adopted accounting standards update no 201602 leases topic 842 asu 201602 also referred to as topic 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and as a result the consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2020 is not comparable with that of january 31 2019 in addition in fiscal 2019 we prospectively adopted accounting standards update no 201601 financial instrumentoverall subtopic 82510 asu 201601 see note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources subscription and support revenues and related professional services subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 

subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services collectively cloud services with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 

the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings as described below in “results of operations” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time additionally we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and as a result the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter in addition some of our cloud service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or the salesforce platform to record account and contact information which are similar features across these service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful 

seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter conversely our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below in millions 

table of contents 

remaining performance obligation 

our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months 

remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors including seasonality the timing of renewals average contract terms foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer 

remaining performance obligation consisted of the following in billions 

table of contents 

1 includes approximately 450 million and 650 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforceorg business combination in june 2019 and the tableau acquisition in august 2019 respectively 

2 includes approximately 400 million and 550 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforceorg business combination in june 2019 and the tableau acquisition in august 2019 respectively 

3 includes approximately 350 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforceorg business combination in june 2019 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions including the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support including the costs of data center capacity certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data and employeerelated costs such as salaries and benefits 

cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and certain thirdparty fees 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and allocated overhead 

marketing and sales   

marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses and commissions for our sales and marketing staff as well as payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition  contracts with multiple performance obligations we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services software licenses premium support and professional services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment 

cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately in determining whether professional services are distinct we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct 

we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where services are sold price lists our gotomarket strategy historical sales and contract prices in instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to ssp 

in certain cases we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices if ssp is not directly observable for example when pricing is highly variable we use a range of ssp we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography 

costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straightline basis over four years which although longer than the typical initial contract period reflects the average period of benefit including expected contract renewals significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit therefore we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts professional services contracts other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents 

• the acquired company’s trade name and existing customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings 

• discount rates 

• uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed 

• fair value of assumed equity awards and 

• fair value of preexisting relationships 

table of contents 

unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

strategic investments accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 

valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics market acceptance of the product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is considered to be impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment

impact of acquisitions 

the comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended january 31 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended january 31 2019 was impacted by our recent business combination and acquisitions including the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 which has been our largest acquisition to date in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the oneyear period subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented  

fiscal year ended january 31 2020 and 2019 

revenues 



the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period revenues from term and perpetual software licenses which are recognized at a point in time represent approximately five percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2020 subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively

the business combination with salesforceorg in june 2019 and acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately 217 million and 652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2020 respectively in addition total revenues for fiscal 2020 benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 as a result of our business combination activity we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity 

our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers we calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve month basis as of the end of each month as of january 31 2020 our attrition rate excluding commerce cloud integration cloud salesforceorg and tableau was less than nine percent our attrition rate for fiscal 2020 benefited in part from the ongoing shift in our business mix to enterprise and international markets which have longer customer contract term durations in general we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until fully integrated into our customer success organization while it is difficult to predict we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

subscription and support revenue by service offering 

subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



subscription and support revenues from quip collaboration platform were not significant in fiscal 2020 and 2019 our industry offerings revenue is included in either sales cloud service cloud or salesforce platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased integration and analytics revenues are included in salesforce platform and other the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately 652 million to salesforce platform and other 

revenues by geography were as follows  



revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity which may be different than the region of the customer the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources revenues in the americas and europe also benefited from our acquisition of tableau in august 2019 f oreign currency fluctuations primarily the strengthening british pound sterling had a negative impact on revenues outside of the americas of approximately 91 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a positive impact of approximately 39 million in fiscal 2019

cost of revenues 



for fiscal 2020 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of 245 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 43 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 213 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of 225 million service delivery costs associated with perpetual and term software licenses is lower than our service delivery costs for our cloud service offerings and as a result our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2020 benefited in part due to this shift in our business mix 

we have increased our headcount by 30 percent since fiscal 2019 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

our professional services and other gross margin was positive 18 million during fiscal 2020 and positive 22 million during fiscal 2019 we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

operating expenses 



for fiscal 2020 the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 561 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 203 million in stockbased expenses an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead our research and development headcount increased by 54 percent since fiscal 2019 in order to improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

for fiscal 2020 the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of 11 billion in employeerelated costs and amortization of deferred commissions an increase of 209 million in stockbased expenses an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 120 million and allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 36 percent since fiscal 2019 primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel 

for fiscal 2020 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 38 percent since fiscal 2019 as we added personnel to support our growth and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase we also incurred transaction costs associated with our 

table of contents 

various acquisitions during fiscal 2020 including approximately 40 million from tableau during fiscal 2019 we incurred approximately 24 million of transaction costs from our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2019 

as a result of the june 2019 salesforceorg business combination the company effectively settled all existing agreements between the company and salesforceorg and as part of business combination accounting accordingly recorded a onetime noncash operating expense charge of approximately 166 million related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement 

other income and expense 



gains on strategic investments net consists primarily of marktomarket adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on privately held equity securities of 208 million and unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of 138 million in addition net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 included gains of approximately 9 million and 39 million as a result of remeasuring our prior equity interest in mapanything and clicksoftware respectively net gains recognized during fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of 345 million 

other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income interest expense was 131 million and 154 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively investment income increased 61 million in fiscal 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago due to higher interest income across our portfolio which is primarily a result of the larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



in fiscal 2020 we recognized a tax provision of 580 million on a pretax income of 706 million our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

in fiscal 2019 we recognized a tax benefit of 127 million on a pretax income of 983 million the tax benefit recognized was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits in addition we recognized tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash provided by operating activities and if necessary our borrowing capacity under our revolving loan credit agreement that provides for 10 billion unsecured financing credit facility and unbilled amounts related to contracted noncancelable subscription agreements which is not reflected on the balance sheet will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion costs associated with thirdparty infrastructure providers additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

table of contents 

our european revenue operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom uk subsidiary which has a functional currency of the british pound sterling this results in a twostep currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound sterling are first remeasured into the british pound sterling and then the british pound sterling is translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements as an example costs incurred in france are remeasured from the euro to the british pound sterling and then translated into the usd our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the remeasurement of nonfunctional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 

in fiscal 2020 we began transitioning away from this ukcentralized european structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe including germany and france to invoice customers directly this transition which may take multiple years would thereby enable the local subsidiaries to recognize revenues operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies with the change to local invoicing in some markets we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency 

in january 2020 the uk exited the european union “eu” “brexit” and entered a transition period expected to last until the end of calendar 2020 during which the uk will continue to be subject to eu rules and regulations while it negotiates the future terms of its relationship with the eu brexit and the outcome of these ongoing negotiations could adversely affect the uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound sterling and euro we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 total revenues generated in europe were approximately 20 percent 19 percent and 18 percent of total revenues respectively of which substantially all were recorded in our uk subsidiary revenues in europe were negatively impacted by approximately 79 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer accounts receivable intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 “asc 815” derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months the amounts of revenue and remaining performance obligation that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the fiscal year using a constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 79 billion at january 31 2020 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at january 31 2020 could result in a 38 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2019 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 43 billion the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 21 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in addition we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk as follows in millions 



the borrowings under our revolving credit facility “credit facility” bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0375 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 075 to 1375 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating our revolving credit facility allows for the libor rate to be phasedout and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit facility we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 005 to 0175 with such rate being based on our credit rating payable in arrears quarterly as of january 31 2020 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally we primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies technology startups and system integrators to create and expand our ecosystem as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies we plan to continue these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive 

as of january 31 2020 our portfolio consisted of investments in over 260 companies with capital investments ranging from less than 03 million to approximately 300 million and 27 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately 10 million 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding active investments within our strategic investment 

table of contents 

portfolio as of january 31 2020 and excludes exited investments in millions 



we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices observable price changes and impairments to our investments these changes could be material based on market conditions and events while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio 

our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences the particular securities we hold and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total company value as such our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company for example an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our significant publicly traded and privately held equity securities held as of january 31 2020 which represents 65 of the strategic investment portfolio could result in a 97 million reduction to the investment portfolio fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment 

we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering currently two of our five publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

in addition the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment all of our investments particularly those in privately held companies are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 our growth strategy 

we invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities 

cross selling and upselling we see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers as our customers realize the benefits of our service offerings we aim to upgrade the customer experience with premium editions and additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units with the goal of ultimately becoming our customers trusted advisors inspiring enterprisewide digital transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct discussions with the highest levels of our customers executive management 

extending existing service offerings  we offer multiple editions of our cloud service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to accommodate new features and functionality we intend to continue to expand all editions of our service offerings with new features functions and increased security through our own development acquisitions and partnerships we have invested heavily in the ai capabilities of einstein which allows users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences as well as innovations like lightning and trailhead that improve the entire platform 

reducing customer attrition  we strive to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms with us through among other things customer success and other related programs 

expanding and strengthening the partner ecosystem  we continue to work with and invest in strategic system integrators “sis” and independent software vendors “isvs” to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries offer a variety of solutions natively and through the appexchange our enterprise cloud marketplace and address the business requirements of both current and future customers 

international expansion  we continue to increase our investment in our international gotomarket resources operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest quality service to our customers around the world 

targeting vertical industries  to meet the needs of our customers in certain industries we provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries such as financial services healthcare and government 

expanding into new horizontal markets  as part of our growth strategy which is driven both organically and through acquisitions we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including analytics commerce iot and integration and expect to continue this type of horizontal expansion in the future 

extending gotomarket capabilities we believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size we will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally primarily through our direct sales force we have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe 

promoting strong customer adoption we believe that we have the people processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully we have free curated resources such as trailhead to help companies of every size learn our systems as well as advisory services technical architects and business strategists to enable and accelerate digital transformation 

encouraging the development of thirdparty applications on our cloud computing platform  the lightning platform enables customers isvs and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloudbased apps it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will help address the business requirements of both current and future customers 

in addition to the key elements of our growth strategy described above from time to time we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services technologies and intellectual property rights these evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in fiscal 2019 including mulesoft inc mulesoft and datorama inc datorama which expanded our integration and marketing capabilities 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture we also offer integration capabilities in the cloud as well as onpremises to provide our customers more options to integrate their data multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other this approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality 

we provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center facilities located in the united states united kingdom germany france japan and other countries these thirdparty data center operators provide space physical security and continuous power and cooling in combination with these thirdparty data center facilities we also run our services on cloud computing platform partners who offer infrastructureasaservice including servers storage databases and networking the use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and those with incountry data privacy requirements as well as to support acquired companies 

our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services and integrating businesses services and technologies from acquisitions performance functional depth security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 

our current competitors include 

 we believe more traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors may become a greater competitive threat as they shift more of their focus to cloud computing 

sources of revenue 

for revenue reporting purposes we group all of our service offerings into four major categories sales cloud service cloud salesforce platform and other and marketing and commerce cloud our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings for a more detailed discussion see the “revenue by cloud service offering” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription revenues from our enterprise cloud computing services software licenses and support fees for our services we also derive revenues from related professional services via our customer success group 

for our subscription and support offerings we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract for software license sales which resulted from our may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft revenues are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer we enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we recognize revenue over time as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in either unearned revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met unearned revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met remaining performance obligations representing future revenues that are under contract but have not yet been recognized are not recorded in unearned revenue we generally invoice customers annually typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing size and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and our first quarter is generally our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

refer to our liquidity and capital resources discussion in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017

to a lesser extent we also have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and other partners in return we typically pay 

these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers we focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity 

our primary marketing activities include 

• multichannel marketing campaigns that span email social web and more which align to a broader customer journey

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and patents as well as contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

employees

risk factors 

tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations stockholders equity cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems or authorized access is blocked or disabled our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant reputational harm legal exposure and liabilities or a negative financial impact 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers customers proprietary and other sensitive data including financial information and personally identifiable information while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers’ customers data our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following 

 these risks are mitigated to the extent possible by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies enhanced processes and internal security controls including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks our board of directors audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security as well as periodic updates on cybersecurity events although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security for example our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following 

 in the normal course of business we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents to date such identified security events have not been material or significant to us including to our reputation or business operations or had a material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant 

a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to or the denial of authorized access to our it systems or data or our customers systems or data including intellectual property proprietary sensitive or other confidential information a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities including those arising from thirdparty hardware or software may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware proprietary software and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

any interruptions or delays in services from thirdparties including data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software hardware and data from a variety of vendors any damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future as we increase our reliance on these thirdparty systems our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements for many of our offerings our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near realtime in a separate facility located elsewhere certain offerings including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our business as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

privacy concerns and laws such as the european union’s general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data in some cases data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s eu general data protection regulation that took effect in may 2018 impose new obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor as well as on many of our customers in addition domestic data privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which will take effect in january 2020 continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens further laws such as the european union’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities 

although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments such as gdpr and ccpa readiness these laws may require us to make additional changes to our services to enable salesforce or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for noncompliance these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some cases impact our ability or our customers ability to offer our services in certain locations to deploy our solutions to reach current and prospective customers or to derive insights from customer data globally for example ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support crossborder data transfers such as the euus and swissus privacy shield framework additionally certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

furthermore the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate the markets for certain of our offerings including our einstein artificial intelligence and data integration offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts and related investments will ever result in significant revenue for us in addition we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades including our lightning platform and customer 360 platform may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customers administrators and developers as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and 

develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues in addition because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technologies as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future in particular in may 2018 we completed our largest acquisition to date of mulesoft for 64 billion which we are continuing to integrate acquisitions and other transactions arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures including 



 any of these risks could harm our business in addition to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

further in some cases industryspecific laws regionallyspecific or productspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa and related federal communication commission fcc orders which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained we have been and may in the future be subject to one or more classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we 

are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services requires continuous innovation and is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

our current competitors include 

 some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories significant installed bases broader geographic scope and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical personnel and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers demands these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing as a result even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent thirdparty organizations that work together to 

provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names icann and the internet assigned numbers authority iana now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet resulting in multiple separate internets these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

in addition certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers impede our growth result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio including changes in the market prices of our investments in public companies and impairments could negatively impact our financial results 

we invest in earlytolate stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and may not realize a return on our strategic investments many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen 

further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

upon adoption of asu 201601 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations as a result we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities this volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter based on market conditions and events and may cause our stock price to decline while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio 

all of our investments especially our investments in privately held companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 



 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet the market price of our common 

stock could decline in addition if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts data center contracts or office leases so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or at all without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally include 



any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue could decline and our business may suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels mix of customer base decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services 

if customers do not renew their subscriptions do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase our business could be harmed 

if thirdparty developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services or if our customers seek warranties from us for thirdparty applications integrations data and content our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of thirdparty developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations data and content that are complementary to our services without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations data and content both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive which could impact future sales in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the pound sterling 

we conduct our business in the following regions the americas europe and asia pacific the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling euro japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar as well as the euro against the pound sterling these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect the fluctuations of 

currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period additionally global political events including the united kingdom’s 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union or “brexit” and similar geopolitical developments fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a thirdparty our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a thirdparty or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many us patents and pending us and international patent applications we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features securely reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers success in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful in addition our services including ai predictions may be used by our customers for purposes inconsistent with our company values which may harm our brand as with many innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business further the development of ai presents emerging ethical issues if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial due to their impact or perceived impact on human rights privacy employment or in other social contexts we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability 

in addition positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers in addition we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties such as office towers and a transit center and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand 

if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our cochief executive officers from time to time there may be changes in our executive 

management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring developing integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of ohana which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family as our organization grows and expands globally and as employees’ workplace expectations develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our income tax obligations are generally determined based on our business operations in these jurisdictions significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes effects from acquisitions changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate any changes ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities 

as our business continues to grow and if we become more profitable we anticipate that our income tax obligations could significantly increase if our existing tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards become fully utilized we may be unable to offset or otherwise mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years this could have a material impact to our future cash flows or operating results 

in addition recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses including certain approaches of addressing taxation of digital economy recently proposed or enacted by the organization for economic cooperation and development the european commission or certain major jurisdictions where we operate might have a material impact to our business and future cash flow from operating activities or future financial results we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position in addition our operations may 

change which may impact our tax liabilities as our brand becomes increasingly recognizable both domestically and internationally our tax planning structure and corresponding profile may be subject to increased scrutiny and if we are perceived negatively we may experience brand or reputational harm 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results 

our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a substantial level of debt including the 2023 and 2028 senior notes we issued in april 2018 senior notes” due april 2023 and april 2028 the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco california “50 fremont” due june 2023 the 5000 million term loan to finance our acquisition of mulesoft due may 2021 2021 term loan and capital lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments including operating lease arrangements which are not reflected on our consolidated  balance sheets as well as a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes in april 2018 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to 10 billion maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

new lease accounting guidance requires that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated  balance sheet in fiscal 2020 which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated  balance sheet 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these 

economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain in addition geopolitical developments such as potential trade wars can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets moreover these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our research and development activities information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business whether for our offices data centers vendors customers or other stakeholders is a priority any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our california headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change climate related events including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on us critical infrastructure have the potential to disrupt our business our third party suppliers or the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards especially but not only concerning revenue recognition cost capitalization and lease accounting may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we have been required to change our accounting policies particularly concerning revenue recognition and the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract to alter our operational policies to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards and to adjust our published financial statements we will have similar requirements related to future accounting pronouncements such as lease accounting such changes may have an adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target which may negatively impact our financial results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls including the commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with these us export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of export or import privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining the necessary authorizations including any required license may be timeconsuming is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore the us 

export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock

legal proceedings 

tableend in the ordinary course of business we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights or alleged violation of commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour or other laws or regulations we have been and may in the future be put on notice andor sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

in december 2018 we were named as a nominal defendant and certain of our current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the delaware court of chancery the complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service included claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors compensation subsequently three similar shareholder derivative actions were filed in the delaware court of chancery the cases have been consolidated under the caption in re salesforcecom inc derivative litigation  we believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not materially and adversely affect the companys business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter the outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are however inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties as a result we may not be able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued including losses that could arise as a result of application of nonmonetary remedies with respect to any contingencies and our estimates may not prove to be accurate 

in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated  results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of a given dispute or other contingency an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows or both in a particular quarter

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues expenses results of operations liquidity plans strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k except as required by law we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors for any reason 

overview 

we are a global leader in customer relationship management crm technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers we introduced our first crm solution in 2000 and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions features and platform capabilities our core mission is to empower our customers of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud mobile social internet of things iot and artificial intelligence ai technologies 

our customer success platform  including sales force automation customer service and support marketing automation digital commerce community management industryspecific solutions analytics integration solutions application development iot integration collaborative productivity tools our appexchange which is our enterprise cloud marketplace and our professional cloud services  provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world key elements of our strategy include 

 we are also committed to a sustainable lowcarbon future advancing equality and diversity and fostering employee success we try to integrate social good into everything we do all of these goals align with our longterm growth strategy and financial and operational priorities 

we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by thirdparty cloud computing platform providers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity whether internally or through the use of third parties the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities 

specifically in our top markets the continued development of our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the continued development of services including community cloud and industry clouds the integration of new and acquired technologies such as commerce cloud artificial intelligence technologies and salesforce quip the expansion of our marketing cloud salesforce platform core service offerings integration cloud through our may 2018 mulesoft inc mulesoft acquisition and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including analytics ecommerce artificial intelligence iot and collaborative productivity tools we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions such as our acquisition of mulesoft and in august 2018 our acquisition of datorama inc datorama we have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income we remain focused on improving operating margins 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month our attrition rate including the marketing cloud service offering but excluding our commerce cloud service offering and integration service offering was less than ten percent as of january 31 2019  while it is difficult to predict we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 46 percent  44 percent  and 45 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 respectively to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base sell more products to existing customers and continue to build greater brand awareness 

during the year we acquired mulesoft an industryleading integration platform to provide our customers the ability to integrate data across platforms the financial results of mulesoft are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the total purchase price for mulesoft was approximately 64 billion  

also in fiscal 2019 we acquired datorama which provides a platform for enterprises agencies and publishers to integrate data across marketing channels and data sources the financial results of datorama are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the total purchase price for datorama was approximately 766 million 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2019  for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2019  

adoption of new accounting standards 

we have adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported due to the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which relates to revenue recognition and the capitalization of costs to acquire a revenue contract the information presented reflects the adjusted amounts as compared to those previously reported in addition we have prospectively adopted accounting standards update no 201601 financial instrumentoverall subtopic 82510 asu 201601 and accounting standards update no 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory asu 201616 see note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated  financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference 

operating segments 

we operate as one operating segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision makers marc benioff who is the cochief executive officer and the chairman of the board and keith block who is the cochief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance over the past few years we have completed a number of acquisitions including the acquisitions of mulesoft and datorama in fiscal 2019 these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments including as a result of our acquisitions our business operates in one operating segment because most of our offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way and our chief operating decision makers evaluate our financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a 

consolidated basis since we operate as one operating segment all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements 

in august 2018 we moved to a cochief executive officer model with the promotion of our vice chairman and chief operating officer keith block we determined that both cochief executive officers also serve as chief operating decision makers for the purposes of segment reporting despite the change in the chief operating decision maker we determined no change to segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services collectively cloud services software licenses and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent  of our total revenues for fiscal 2019  subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types and the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services 

subscription and support revenues for cloud services are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract subscription revenues for software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 

we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in note 1 summary of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference 

revenue by cloud service offering 

the information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings all of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



subscription and support revenues from the community cloud quip and our industry offerings were not significant in fiscal 2019  quip revenue is included with salesforce platform and other in the table above our industry offerings and community cloud revenue are included in either sales cloud service cloud or salesforce platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased revenue from our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 is included in salesforce platform and other 

as required under us gaap we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from mulesoft at fair value on the date of acquisition as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that mulesoft would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity of the 29 billion subscription and support revenue for salesforce platform and other for fiscal 2019  approximately 360 million was attributed to mulesoft 

in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings such as through an enterprise license agreement we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan the service that was provided at the inception of the contract and standalone selling price ssp of those products we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract we have allocated approximately 17 percent  15 percent  13 percent  of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2019   2018 and 2017 respectively based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above 

additionally some of our service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or the salesforce platform to record account and contact information which are similar features across these core service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful 

our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues as a result sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings conversely revenue for marketing and commerce cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement 

the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time while we are a market leader in each core offering we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers accordingly the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter 

seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in unearned revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below in millions  





the unearned revenue balance on our consolidated  balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors including seasonality the timing of renewals average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low remaining performance obligations attributable to a particular subscription agreement are often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer 

remaining performance obligation formerly referred to as remaining transaction price consisted of the following in billions 

includes 500 million of remaining performance obligation related to fiscal 2019 acquisitions including contracts executed subsequent to acquisition 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data we allocate overhead such as it infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors certain thirdparty fees and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and thirdparty infrastructure providers in addition we intend to continue to invest additional resources in enhancing our cyber security measures as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with the purchase of acquired developed technology will be included in cost of revenues additionally as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology services or data or as our sales volume grows the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase finally we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses technologies and all of our service offerings 

marketing and sales   

marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions as well as payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter in addition as we acquire new businesses and technologies a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost we expect marketing and sales expenses excluding sales personnel expenses to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses these may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs security costs professional fees other corporate expenses such as transaction costs for acquisitions and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters however the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues will affect our general and administrative expenses 

stockbased expenses   

our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired through business combinations 

our cost of revenues operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology trade names and trademarks and customer relationships we expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated  financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition    contracts with multiple performance obligations  we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services software licenses premium support and professional services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment 

cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately in determining whether professional services are distinct we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct 

we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where services are sold price lists our gotomarket strategy historical sales and contract prices as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to ssp 

in certain cases we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices if ssp is not directly observable for example when pricing is highly variable we use a range of ssp we determine the ssp range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography 

costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straightline basis over four years which although longer than the typical initial contract period reflects the average period of benefit including expected contract renewals significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit therefore we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

strategic investments  accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions privately held 

equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer and impairments 

privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is considered to be impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated  statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment

3 amount includes a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of 612 million  2 million  and 226 million  for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the fiscal 2019 benefit was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 

prior period information has been adjusted for the adoption of topic 606 

the following table sets forth selected balance sheet and other metrics data for each of the periods indicated in millions other than remaining performance obligation which is presented in billions

fiscal year ended january 31 2019  and 2018 

revenues 



the increase  in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 contributed 431 million  to total revenues in fiscal 2019  the increase was also driven by approximately 227 million  of revenue recognized at a point in time which includes the portion of software subscriptions allocated to the onpremise software element 

we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented the increase  in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

revenues   by geography were as follows  



revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity which may be different than the region of the customer americas revenue attributed to the united states was approximately 96 percent  during fiscal year 2019 and 2018  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 38 billion  or 29 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2019  compared to 29 billion  or 28 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 09 billion  or 31 percent  the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources revenues outside of the americas increased on a total dollar basis by 39 million  in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling 

cost of revenues 



the increase  in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of 156 million  in employeerelated costs an increase  of 31 million  in stockbased expenses an increase of 326 million  in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase  of amortization of purchased intangible assets of 49 million  and an increase of 26 million  in allocated overhead we have increased our headcount by 16 percent  since january 31 2018  to meet the higher demand for services from our customers of which a component was also due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

the cost of professional services and other revenues was 847 million  during fiscal 2019  resulting in positive  gross margin of 22 million  the cost of professional services and other revenues was 740 million  during fiscal 2018  resulting in positive  gross margins of 34 million  we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

operating expenses 



the increase  in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 216 million  in employeerelated costs an increase  of 47 million  in stockbased expenses an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 19 percent  since january 31 2018  in order to improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies including our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 additionally a component of our increased headcount was also due to the acquisition of mulesoft we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of 797 million  in employeerelated costs and amortization of deferred commissions an increase  of 174 million  in stockbased expenses an increase  in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 111 million  and allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent  since january 31 2018  of which a component was due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel 

the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 27 percent  since january 31 2018  as we added personnel to support our growth as well as an increase due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 

other income and expense 



the increase in investment income was due to higher interest income across our portfolio which is primarily a result of increasing interest rates 

interest expense consists of interest on our debt capital leases and financing obligation related to 350 mission the increase in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense on the 2023 senior notes and 2028 senior notes of approximately 71 million  we expect interest expense to increase in future years as the 2023 senior notes and 2028 senior notes will be outstanding for a full year as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2019 

gains on strategic investments net consists primarily of marktomarket adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments the prospective adoption of asu 201601 resulted in unrealized gains in our equity securities of approximately 446 million  during fiscal 2019  excluding gains on sales of equity securities these gains were primarily driven by marktomarket adjustments to our publicly traded securities of 345 million  during fiscal 2019  

other income expense primarily consists of nonoperating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



we recorded a tax benefit  of 127 million  on a pretax income  of 983 million  for fiscal 2019  the tax benefit recorded was primarily related to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits in addition we recorded current tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

in fiscal 2018  we recorded a tax provision  of 60 million  on a pretax income  of 420 million  the tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

fiscal years ended january 31 2018 and 2017 

revenues 



the increase in subscription and support revenues during fiscal 2018 was primarily caused by volumedriven increases from new business which included new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers additionally fiscal 2018 benefited from a full year of revenue from demandware which we acquired in july 2016 this was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately 20 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

revenues by geography were as follows in millions 



revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity which may be different than the region of the customer americas revenue attributed to the united states was approximately 96 percent during fiscal 2018 and 2017 

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 29 billion or 28 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 22 billion or 26 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2017 an increase of 07 billion or 34 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources revenues outside of the americas increased on a total dollar basis by 96 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling 

cost of revenues   



the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of 192 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 23 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 197 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of 38 million and an increase of 23 million in allocated overhead we increased our headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions 

the cost of professional services and other revenues was 740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margin of 34 million the cost of professional services and other revenues was 617 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margins of 21 million 

operating expenses   



the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 212 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 72 million in stockbased expenses an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate previously acquired companies including our fiscal 2017 acquisitions 

the change in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of 637 million in employeerelated costs and amortization of deferred commissions an increase of 80 million in stockbased expenses an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of 23 million and allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent 

during fiscal 2018 the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 16 percent during fiscal 2018 as we added personnel to support our growth 

other income and expense 



the increase in investment income was due to higher interest income across our portfolio 

interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes capital leases financing obligation related to 350 mission the loan assumed on 50 fremont revolving credit facility and the 500 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of demandware 

gains on strategic investments net represents strategic investments fair market value adjustments and gains recognized related to strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss the change in gains on strategic investments net was primarily due to 14 million of gains resulting from our acquisition of companies in which we held strategic investments in fiscal 2017 

other income expense primarily consists of nonoperating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



we recognized a tax provision of 60 million on a pretax income of 420 million for fiscal 2018 the tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

in fiscal 2017 we recorded a tax benefit of 144 million on a pretax income of 179 million for fiscal 2017 the most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of 210 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of demandware the net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result we released a portion of our valuation allowance the tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2019  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 43 billion  and accounts receivable of 49 billion  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations us treasury securities asset backed securities foreign government obligations mortgage backed obligations time deposits money market mutual funds and municipal securities 

as of january 31 2019  our remaining performance obligation was 257 billion  our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet that will be recognized as revenue in future periods 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash provided by operating activities and if necessary our borrowing capacity under our credit facility and unbilled amounts related to contracted noncancelable subscription agreements which is not reflected on the balance sheet will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies and intellectual property rights to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments 

cash flows 

for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017 our cash flows were as follows in millions 



cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income  adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations the expense associated with stockbased awards net gains on strategic investments the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of payments against accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities the timing of our semiannual interest payments related to our senior notes the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs and changes in working capital accounts net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2019  for the transaction fees related to the acquisition of mulesoft 

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses unearned revenue and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across the quarters 

as described above in “seasonal nature of unearned revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and correspondingly the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and unearned revenue which is reflected on the balance sheets and as the next billing cycle approaches the corresponding unearned revenue decreases to zero the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers as such our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019  primarily related to the acquisitions of mulesoft datorama and cloudcraze net of cash acquired for a total of 51 billion  net cash used in investing activities also included purchases of marketable securities of 11 billion  purchases of strategic investments of 362 million  and new office build outs and capital investments of 595 million  offset by sales of marketable securities of 14 billion  the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of 20 billion  new office buildouts and capital investments of 534 million  which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of 636 million  the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of demandware in july 2016 and purchases of marketable securities which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities 

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019  consisted primarily of 30 billion  from proceeds from issuance of debt which were used in the acquisition of mulesoft and 704 million  from proceeds from equity plans offset by 15 billion  of repayments of debt including principal payments on the maturity of the 025 senior notes and the early repayment and termination of the 2019 term loan net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of 650 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by 323 million in repayments of debt net cash provided by 

financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt which were used to partially fund acquisitions offset by repayments of debt 

debt 

the carrying values of our borrowings were as follows in millions  



as of january 31 2019  we have senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2021 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of 30 billion  in addition we have senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on 50 fremont due in 2023 with a total carrying value of 196 million  we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of january 31 2019  

we maintain a revolving loan credit agreement that provides for 10 billion  unsecured financing credit facility that matures in april 2023 we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the credit facility for refinancing other indebtedness working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes including permitted acquisitions there were no  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of january 31 2019  

as of january 31 2019  we have a total of 92 million  in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and expire at various dates through december 2030 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space colocation data center facilities and our development and test data center as well as leases for computer equipment software furniture and fixtures excluding all secured and unsecured debt at january 31 2019  the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in millions  



the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations

the lease obligation  buildings to be constructed above represents the total obligation for two separate agreements for office facilities we entered into during fiscal 2019  the first agreement is for approximately 324000  rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of our urban campus in san francisco california we expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024 and the total noncancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately 480 million  over 16 years  construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the city and county of san francisco the second agreement is for approximately 603000  rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in chicago illinois we expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2022 and the total noncancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately 475 million  over 17 years  as of january 31 2019  construction has not commenced on either of these buildings and the timing of completion of construction is unknown due to this uncertainty the entire commitment for these two obligations is reflected as payments due in more than five years in the table above

during fiscal 2019  and in future fiscal years we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations increase productivity and enhance our security measures we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

utilization of tax carryforwards and credits 

as we continue our trend in profitability we expect to utilize our net operating loss carryforward and various tax credits to reduce our cash tax payments for example our federal net operating loss carryforwards are 21 billion  as of january 31 

2019 as compared to 27 billion as of january 31 2018 we expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the us to be consistent with those paid in prior years

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

our european revenue operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom uk subsidiary which has a functional currency of the british pound this results in a twostep currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated  financial statements as an example costs incurred in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the remeasurement of nonfunctional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 

in fiscal 2020 we will begin transitioning away from this ukcentralized european structure and enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe to invoice customers directly and thereby recognize revenues operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies with the change to local invoicing in some markets we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency thereby reducing our foreign currency exposure 

the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union eu “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the eu and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 total revenues generated in europe were approximately 19 percent  18 percent and 16 percent  of total revenues respectively of which substantially all were recorded in our uk subsidiary revenues in europe increased on a total dollar basis by 35 million and 104 million in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 respectively as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer accounts receivable intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 “asc 815” derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated  balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated  statements of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate 

realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months the amounts of revenue and unearned revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the three months using a constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 43 billion  at january 31 2019  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2019  could result in a 21 million  market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 45 billion  the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 34 million  

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in addition we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk as follows in millions 



the 2021 term loan bears interest at our option at either a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 025 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0625 to 125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating by entering into the 2021 term loan we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations the 2021 term loan was signed in april 2018 and funds were received in may 2018 

the borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 0375 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 075 to 1375 in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the revolving credit facility we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 005 to 0175 with such rate being based on our public 

debt rating payable in arrears quarterly as of january 31 2019  there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the revolving credit facility 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models as of january 31 2019  our portfolio which consists of investments in over 235  privately held companies and six  public companies is primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators our investments in these companies range from 01 million  to approximately 105 million  with 21  investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately 10 million as of january 31 2019  

we invest in earlytolate stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions the americas europe and asia pacific we plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive 

the primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of ai mobile applications and connected products therefore we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering currently three  of our six publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 

upon adoption of asu 201601 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the statement of operations as such we anticipate additional volatility to our statements of operations in future periods due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of our investments in privately held securities these changes could be material based on market conditions and events while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results that may not be true for future periods particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our strategic investments portfolio 

in addition the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment all of our investments particularly those in privately held companies are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital

controls and procedures 

tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this report 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2019  based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework  2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of mulesoft inc “mulesoft” which we acquired in may 2018 as discussed in note 7 business combinations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of mulesoft in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenues subject to mulesoft’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately three percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2019 total net income subject to mulesoft’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately three percent of our consolidated total net income for the fiscal year ended january 31 2019 total assets subject to mulesofts internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated total assets excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of january 31 2019 total net assets subject to mulesofts internal control over financial reporting represented approximately one percent of our consolidated net assets excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of january 31 2019 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2019  we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2019  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2019  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

technology development and operations 

we deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other this approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality 

we provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center facilities located in the united states united kingdom germany france japan and other countries these thirdparty data center operators provide space physical security continuous power and cooling in combination with these thirdparty data center facilities we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer infrastructure as a service including servers storage databases and networking the use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and those with incountry data privacy requirements as well as to support acquired companies 

our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services performance functional depth security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

sources of revenue 

for revenue reporting purposes we group all of our service offerings into four major categories sales cloud service cloud salesforce platform and other and marketing and commerce cloud our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings for a more detailed discussion see the “revenue by cloud service offering” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription and support fees for our services we also derive revenues from related professional services via the success cloud 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract we enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we recognize revenue as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual installments 

deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing size and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and our first quarter is generally our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 

customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee which can include services such as priority access to technical resources developer support and system administration in addition we offer a mission critical support addon that is 

designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customers specific enterprise architecture and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products 

sales and marketing 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and other partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers we focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity 

our primary marketing activities include 

 we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions such as the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 28 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2018 comes from customers outside of the americas 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 

our current competitors include 



we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they may become a greater competitive threat 

strategic investments 

since 2009 we have been investing in early to latestage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives which include among other things extending the capabilities of our platform and service offerings increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the nextgeneration of mobile applications and connected products our minority investments in over 200 companies as of january 31 2018 also help us stay connected with the rapid pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry in some cases we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested due to the inherent risk in investing our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and patents as well as contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

employees 

as of january 31 2018 we had more than 29000 employees none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however for certain foreign subsidiaries works councils represent our employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems or authorized access is blocked or disabled our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers customers proprietary and other sensitive data including financial information and other personally identifiable information while we have security measures in place they may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to or denying authorized access to our it systems our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data our data or our it systems 

because the techniques used to breach obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it systems change frequently grow more complex over time and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem and as illustrated by the recent spectre and meltdown threats if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components a security breach could occur in addition our internal it systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers which increases the complexity of our it systems these risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks 

in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our servers because we do not control our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services 

a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data or the denial of access to this data a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities including those arising from thirdparty hardware or software may result in additional direct and indirect costs for example additional infrastructure capacity to mitigate any system degradation that could result from remediation efforts 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware proprietary software and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

any interruptions or delays in services from thirdparties including data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software hardware and data from a variety of vendors any damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements for many of our offerings our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near realtime in a separate facility located elsewhere certain offerings including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our business when we add data centers and add capacity we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

privacy concerns and laws such as the european union’s general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data in some cases new data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s eu general data protection regulation that takes effect in may 2018 and an amended act on the protection of personal information in japan impose new obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor as well as on many of our customers these new laws may require us to make changes to our services to enable salesforce andor our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for noncompliance further laws such as the european union’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers ability to deploy our solutions globally for example ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support crossborder data transfers such as the euus and swissus privacy shield framework additionally certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

furthermore concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate the markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts and related investments will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades including our conversion to our new lightning platform and introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customers administrators and developers as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues in addition because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition 

• difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations technologies services platforms and personnel 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

 any of these risks could harm our business in addition to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability 

to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

further in some cases industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa and related federal communication commission fcc orders which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained we are and may in the future be subject to one or more classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure data center capacity research customer support and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current 

enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

our current competitors include 

 some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories significant installed bases broader geographic scope and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers demands as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent thirdparty organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names icann and the internet assigned numbers authority iana now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet resulting in multiple separate internets these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

in addition certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers impede our growth result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments otherthantemporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results 

we invest in earlytolate stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and may not realize a return on our strategic investments many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are 

dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record an otherthantemporary impairment which could be material we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results and may harm our business and cause our stock price to decline all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 



 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet the market price of our common stock could decline in addition if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with deferred commissions data center contracts or office leases so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or at all without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally include 



 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue could decline and our business may suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels mix of customer base decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services 

if customers do not renew their subscriptions do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase our business could be harmed 

if thirdparty developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services or if our customers seek warranties from us for thirdparty applications integrations data and content our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of thirdparty developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations data and content that are complementary to our services without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations data and content both current and potential customers 

may not find our services sufficiently attractive which could impact future sales in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the pound sterling 

we conduct our business in the following regions the americas europe and asia pacific the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling euro japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar as well as the euro against the pound sterling these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve economic conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period additionally global political events including the united kingdom’s 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union or “brexit” and similar geopolitical developments have caused global economic uncertainty which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging our hedging activities are limited and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a thirdparty our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a thirdparty or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we 

have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many us patents and pending us and international patent applications we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features securely reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers success in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful in addition positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers in addition we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties such as office towers and a transit center and any negative events or publicity arising from these facilities could adversely impact our 

brand if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of ohana which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family as our organization grows and expands globally and as employees’ workplace expectations develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees and negatively impact our future growth 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles and changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals for example the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act tax act significantly changed income tax law that affect us corporations we made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations of the provisional amounts reflected in our financial statements the us treasury department the internal revenue service irs and other standardsetting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered and additional accounting guidance or interpretations may be issued in the future that is different from our current interpretation as we further analyze the new law and collect relevant 

information to complete our computations of the related accounting impact we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made in addition other countries are considering fundamental tax law changes any changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a substantial level of debt including the 025 convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 “025 senior notes” due april 1 2018 the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco california “50 fremont” the 5000 million term loan to finance our acquisition of demandware due july 2019 the “term loan” and capital lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes in july 2016 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to 10 billion maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 

a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

new lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020 which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain in addition geopolitical developments can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets moreover these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ 

purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our research and development activities information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

while we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business whether for our offices vendors customers or other stakeholders is a priority any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to resume operations 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards especially but not only concerning revenue recognition cost capitalization and lease accounting may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we might be required to change our accounting policies particularly concerning revenue recognition the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting to alter our operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards or to restate our published financial statements such changes may have an adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target which may negatively impact our financial results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls including the commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with these us export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of export or import privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining the necessary authorizations including any required license may be timeconsuming is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore the us export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

we may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes in addition if a holder converts its notes we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes which could harm our reputation financing opportunities and our business 

the fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes if however the price of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions 

the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities once commenced will not be discontinued without notice the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in or discontinue engaging in any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 



 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

legal proceedings 

tableend in the ordinary course of business we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights or alleged violation of commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour or other laws or regulations we have been and may in the future be put on notice andor sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a thirdparty in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and 

expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter the outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are however inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties as a result we may not be able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued including losses that could arise as a result of application of nonmonetary remedies with respect to any contingencies and our estimates may not prove to be accurate 

in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of a given dispute or other contingency an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows or both in a particular quarter

tableend

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues expenses results of operations liquidity plans strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k except as required by law we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors for any reason 

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions with a focus on customer relationship management or crm we introduced our first crm solution in 2000 and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions features and platform capabilities our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud mobile social internet of things “iot” and artificial intelligence technologies 

our customer success platform  including sales force automation customer service and support marketing automation digital commerce community management industryspecific solutions analytics application development iot integration collaborative productivity tools our appexchange which is our enterprise cloud marketplace and our professional cloud services  provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world key elements of our strategy include 

 we are also committed to a sustainable lowcarbon future advancing equality and diversity and fostering employee success we try to integrate social good into everything we do all of these goals align with our longterm growth strategy and financial and operational priorities 

we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by thirdparty cloud computing platform providers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity whether internally or through the use of third parties the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities specifically in our top markets the continued development of our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the continued development of services including community cloud industry clouds and success cloud the integration of new and acquired technologies such as commerce cloud artificial intelligence technologies and salesforce 

quip the expansion of our marketing cloud and salesforce platform core service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including analytics ecommerce artificial intelligence iot and collaborative productivity tools we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions such as our july 2016 acquisition of demandware inc “demandware” a digital commerce leader we have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income we remain focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2019  and beyond 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month our current attrition rate which does not include the marketing and commerce cloud service offerings was between eight and nine percent as of january 31 2018  our attrition rate including the marketing cloud service offering was less than ten percent as of january 31 2018  while it is difficult to predict we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 46  percent and 47 percent for fiscal 2018  and 2017 respectively to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base sell more products to existing customers and continue to build greater brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2018  for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2018  

operating segments 

we operate as one operating segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker who in our case is the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance over the past few years we have completed a number of acquisitions these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments including as a result of our acquisitions our business operates in one operating segment because the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way and   our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis since we operate as one operating segment all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent  of our total revenues for fiscal 2018  subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2018  and 2017  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are 

recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” 

revenue by cloud service offering 

the information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings all of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



subscription and support revenues from the community cloud quip and our industry offerings were not significant in fiscal 2018  quip revenue is included with salesforce platform and other in the table above our industry offerings and community cloud revenue are included in either sales cloud service cloud or salesforce platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased 

as required under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from demandware at fair value on the date of acquisition as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity of the 13499 million  subscription and support revenue for marketing and commerce cloud for fiscal 2018  approximately 2534 million was attributed to commerce cloud 

in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings such as through an enterprise license agreement we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract we have allocated approximately 14 percent  13 percent  and 10 percent   of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2018  2017 and 2016 respectively based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above 

additionally some of our service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or our salesforce platform to record account and contact information which are similar features across these core service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful 

our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues as a result sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings conversely revenue for marketing and commerce cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement 

the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time while we are a market leader in each core offering we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers accordingly the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles approximately 80 percent of the value of all subscription and support related invoices excluding demandware related invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

unbilled deferred revenue an operational measure 

the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table below our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels as we recognize revenue deferred revenue and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sellthrough to an end user customer unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customers minimum commitment 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below in thousands except unbilled deferred revenue 









cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data we allocate overhead such as it infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors certain thirdparty fees and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and thirdparty infrastructure providers as we acquire new businesses and technologies the majority of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues additionally as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology services or data or as our sales volume grows the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase finally we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses technologies and all of our service offerings 

marketing and sales   

marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions as well as payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter in addition as we acquire new businesses and technologies a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute 

dollars and continue to be our largest cost we expect marketing and sales expenses excluding sales personnel expenses to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

general and administrative   

general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters however the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues will affect our general and administrative expenses 

stockbased expenses   

our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

during fiscal 2018  we recognized stockbased expense related to our equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors of 9970 million  as of january 31 2018  the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately 18 billion  we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 8554 million  during fiscal 2019  5827 million  during fiscal 2020  3181 million  during fiscal 2021  595 million  during fiscal 2022  172 million  during fiscal 2023 and 80 million  thereafter the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2018  and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

in prior years we had our annual equity grant cycle for employees in the month of november during fiscal 2018 we changed our annual equity grant to occur in the month of march starting in fiscal 2019 therefore the stockbased expense timing for fiscal 2018 is not consistent with prior years we granted 149 million  shares under the annual equity grant in fiscal 2017 whereas we did not grant any shares under the annual equity grant cycle in fiscal 2018 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations and the purchase of 50 fremont   

our cost of revenues operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology trade names and trademarks customer lists acquired leases and customer relationships we expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 



 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

our professional services contracts are either on a time and materials fixedfee or subscription basis as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services the milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multiple deliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions premium support and professional services if the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual installments the deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2018  we deferred 7993 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 4647 million  to sales expense during fiscal 2017  we deferred 4620 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 3715 million  to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 8743 million  at january 31 2018  and 5396 million  at january 31 2017  

capitalized internaluse software costs  we are required to follow the guidance of accounting standards codification 350 “asc 350” intangibles goodwill and other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internaluse and the accounting for webbased product development costs asc 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs which are incurred during the application development stage and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset we deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems as a result of this software as a service delivery model we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard 

costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 

stockbased expense we recognize stockbased expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period of the awards which is generally the vesting term of four years we recognize stockbased expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 employee stock purchase plan “espp” on a straightline basis over the offering period which is 12 months 

stockbased expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straightline basis over the service period of the awards which is generally the vesting term of three years 

we at times grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment and as a result we have accounted for them as postacquisition stockbased expense we recognize stockbased expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the awards 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

in the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations 

goodwill and intangibles we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected attrition rates discount rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans andor tax planning strategies should there be a change in our ability to realize deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act tax act was enacted into law significantly changing income tax law that affects us corporations key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 expensing of certain qualified property significant changes to the us international tax system such as a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and how foreign earnings are subject to us tax we are required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment including the determination of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred taxes as well as to reassess the realizability of our deferred tax assets subsequent to the enactment of the tax act the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the tax act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date due to the timing of the tax act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued by the us treasury department irs and other standardsetting bodies in the future we have not completed our analysis of the income tax effects of the tax act our provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under sab 118 based upon our ongoing analysis of our data and tax positions along with the new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law 

strategic investments  we hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence as defined in accounting standards codification 323 “asc 323” investments  equity method and joint ventures marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt securities which consist of debt investments in privately held companies are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting if based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and nonmarketable securities relate we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments 

we determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the nonmarketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available to us valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

if the fair value of an investment is below our cost we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis which includes the severity and duration of the impairment if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2018  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 45 billion  and accounts receivable of 39 billion  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations us treasury securities asset backed securities foreign government obligations mortgage backed obligations time deposits money market mutual funds and municipal securities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 27 billion  during fiscal 2018  and 22 billion  during the same period a year ago net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion  during fiscal 2017  and 17 billion  during fiscal 2016  cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income  adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations amortization of debt discount the expense associated with stockbased awards gains on sales of strategic investments the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of payments against accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs and changes in working capital accounts 

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable deferred commissions prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses deferred revenue and other current 

liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and correspondingly the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheets and as the contract renewal approaches the corresponding deferred revenue decreases to zero the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers as such our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement “ revolving loan credit agreement ” which provides for a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” that matures in july 2021 we may use any future borrowings under the credit facility for refinancing other indebtedness working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes including permitted acquisitions we may borrow amounts under the credit facility at any time during the term of the revolving loan credit agreement  as of january 31 2018  we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility we were in compliance with the revolving loan credit agreement ’s covenants as of january 31 2018

as of january 31 2018  we have a total of 999 million  in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and expire at various dates through december 2030 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space colocation data center facilities and our development and test data center as well as leases for computer equipment software furniture and fixtures at january 31 2018  the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands 



the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

the financing obligation  leased facility above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 mission st 350 mission in san francisco california as of january 31 2018  2182 million  of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation  leased facility of which the current portion is included in “accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities” and the noncurrent portion is included in “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

in april 2016 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years we paid 960 million  in connection with this agreement during fiscal 2018  the agreement further provides that we will pay an additional 1080 million  in fiscal 2019 and 1260 million  in fiscal 2020 this agreement is included in the table above under contractual commitments 

in july 2017 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty to obtain the exclusive naming rights for the salesforce transit center project in san francisco for a period of 25 years we paid a nonrefundable fee of 10 million upon execution of the agreement and we are obligated to pay approximately 44 million each year over the life of the agreement the agreement may be terminated by us without cause upon satisfaction of certain conditions and is therefore excluded from the table above 

during fiscal 2018  and in future fiscal years we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies and intellectual property rights to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash provided by operating activities and if necessary our borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months we expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the us to be consistent with those paid in prior years additionally the onetime transition tax under the tax act will not have an impact on our cash taxes based on our provisional assessment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

our european revenue operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom subsidiary which has a functional currency of the british pound this results in a twostep currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements as an example costs incurred in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the remeasurement of nonfunctional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer account receivables intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 “asc 815” derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd as the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were higher relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 45 billion  at january 31 2018  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2018  could result in a 335 million  market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market 

value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2017  we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 22 billion  the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 130 million  

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in march 2013 we issued at par value 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes “notes” due in april 2018 holders of the notes may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes the amounts in excess of the principal amounts if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 025 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of the notes is exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the principal balance of our notes was 103 billion  as of january 31 2018  the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31 2018  was 18 billion  the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2018  which was 17095  

in july 2016 we amended our credit agreement “ revolving loan credit agreement ” to provide for a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” that matures in july 2021 

the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075  or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175  in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the revolving credit facility we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0125 to 025  with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period payable in arrears quarterly as of january 31 2018  there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility 

in february 2015 we assumed a 2000 million  loan with the acquisition of 50 fremont “loan” the loan bears an interest rate of 375  per annum and is due in june 2023 for the remainder of fiscal 2018 the loan requires interest only payments beginning in fiscal 2019 principal and interest payments are required with the remaining principal due at maturity the loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee the agreement governing the loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of january 31 2018  

in july 2016 we entered into a 5000 million  term loan “term loan” which matures in july 2019 and bears interest at our option at either a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175 in each case with such spread being determined based on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period we entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of demandware interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate 

by entering into the term loan we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 22  as of january 31 2018  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies which range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models as of january 31 2018  our portfolio consists of investments in over 200 privately held companies and two  public companies primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators our investments in these companies range from 02 million  to over 900 million  with 16  investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately 100 million as of january 31 2018  

we invest in earlytolate stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions the americas europe and asia pacific we plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives as opportunities arise that we find attractive 

the primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of mobile applications and connected products therefore we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies in certain cases our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering currently one of our publicly held investments is subject to such a contractual obligation which expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

our strategic investments in privately held companies are primarily in preferred stock of the respective investees and therefore provide us with liquidation preferences in the event there are certain liquidation events when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for investments in nonmarketable debt at their estimated fair value and equity securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting 

as of january 31 2018  and january 31 2017  the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was 6528 million  and 5260 million  respectively the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was 9120 million  and 7583 million  as of january 31 2018  and january 31 2017  respectively the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value we may be required to record an impairment that is otherthantemporary which could be material we have in the past recorded other than temporary impairments or written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital

controls and procedures 

tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this report 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2018  based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework  2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2018  we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2018  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2018  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because 

of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

reducing customer attrition our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms we run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers 

encouraging the development of thirdparty applications on our cloud computing platforms the salesforce platform enables existing customers independent software vendors “isvs” and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloudbased apps it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange our online marketplace for business apps or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers 

in addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above from time to time we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies and intellectual property rights this evaluation resulted in our acquisition in fiscal 2017 of several companies such as 

 

prior to this acquisition activity our most significant acquisition was exacttarget inc in fiscal 2014 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture 

multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance and their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants our multitenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications multitenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent incremental improvements to our services benefiting the entire user community 

our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than onpremise software that must be written to the different hardware operating systems and database platforms existing within a customer’s unique systems environment our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform 

our efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology as part of our business strategy we periodically acquire companies or technologies and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions performance functional depth security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

our customers access our services over the internet via all of the major internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems 

we provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries these thirdparty data center providers provide space physical security continuous power and cooling the remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer infrastructure as a service including servers storage databases and networking 

sources of revenue 

all of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings sales cloud service cloud salesforce platform and other and marketing cloud our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings for a more detailed discussion see the “revenue by cloud service offering” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service we also derive revenues from premier support which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract we enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we recognize revenue as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual installments 

 deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing size and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding 

effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions such as the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 26  percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

direct sales 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects 

this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and other partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer 

we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

strategic investments 

since 2009 we have been investing in earlytolate stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives which include among other things extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the nextgeneration of mobile applications and connected products our minority investments in over 180  companies as of january 31 2017  also help us stay connected with the pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry in some cases we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested 

because of the inherent risk in investing in earlytolate stage technology companies our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers we focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity 

our primary marketing activities include 



 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee which can include services such as priority access to technical resources developer support and system administration in addition we offer a mission critical support addon that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customers specific enterprise architecture and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps including crm collaboration ecommerce and business intelligence software we also compete with internally developed apps we may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors as well as startup and midsized companies focused on disruption who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they may become a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

employees 

as of january 31 2017  we had more than 25000  employees none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however for certain foreign subsidiaries workers’ councils represent our employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers customers proprietary and other sensitive data including financial information and other personally identifiable information security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability while we have security measures in place they may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it systems our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data our data or our it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services because we do not control our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in services from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors any damage to or failure of our systems generally including the systems of our thirdparty platform providers could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data are currently replicated in near realtime in a separate facility located elsewhere companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 

these hardware software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities result in customer losses and harm our business when we add data centers and add capacity we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 

the internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names icann and the internet assigned numbers authority iana now under the stewardship of icann 

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure denialofservice attacks or related cyber incidents and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet resulting in multiple separate internets these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internetbased services any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage and use of personal information in some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s data protection directive and the countryspecific laws and regulations that implement that directive also govern the processing of personal information further laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes such as the european union’s eprivacy directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our 

customers ability to deploy our solutions globally for example in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states while other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain the invalidation of the useu safe harbor framework may result in different european data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data which could result in increased regulation cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

furthermore concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results further there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa and related federal communication commission fcc orders the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

in some cases industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps including crm collaboration ecommerce and business intelligence software we also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 



 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition 

• difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations technologies services platforms and personnel 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

 any of these risks could harm our business in addition to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be 

diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments otherthantemporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results 

we invest in earlytolate stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and may not realize a return on our strategic investments many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment which could be material we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 



 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that historical quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a data center contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that historical periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the markets for our analytics community iot commerce and salesforce quip clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in 

significant revenue for us commerce cloud originated as part of our demandware acquisition and salesforce quip originated from our acquisition of quip further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades including our conversion to our new lightning platform and introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business historically sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented less than 30 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states as well as international operations generally include 

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantage or otherwise succeed 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers competition pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer 

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our services without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell all of which could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

we conduct our business in the following locations united states europe canada asia south america and australia the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings recent events including the united kingdom’s 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union or “brexit” and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the european union and elsewhere could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations and related risks for our business 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure data center capacity research customer support and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful in addition positions the company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management 

team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives data scientists and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture or aloha spirit which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family as our organization grows we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future success 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively affect our rate of growth in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation enacted in the united kingdom and australia other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions additionally in october 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development released final guidance covering various topics including transfer pricing countrybycountry reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a high level of debt including the 025 convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 the “ 025  senior notes” due april 1 2018 the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco california “50 fremont” and capital lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes in july 2016 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to 10 billion also in july 2016 we entered into the 5000 million term loan to finance our acquisition of demandware maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 

a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

new lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020 which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain in addition recent geopolitical developments including brexit have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain moreover these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards especially but not only concerning revenue recognition cost capitalization and lease accounting may negatively impact our financial results 

we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us as a result of new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation we might be required to change our accounting policies particularly concerning revenue recognition the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting to alter our operational policies so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards or to restate our published financial statements such changes may have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial position and profit or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target which may negatively impact our financial results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with federal state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws 

our solutions are subject to export and import controls including the commerce department’s export administration regulations us customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control if we fail to comply with these us export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including the possible loss of export or import privileges fines which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and in extreme cases the incarceration of responsible employees or managers obtaining the necessary authorizations including any required license may be timeconsuming is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore the us export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to us sanctions targets our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions any such sales could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties and reputational harm changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries governments or persons altogether any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include 



 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

we may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes in addition if a holder converts its notes we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes which could harm our reputation financing opportunities and our business 

the fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

  

the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes if however the price of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions 

the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities however could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities once commenced will not be discontinued without notice the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in or discontinue engaging in any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

legal proceedings 

tableend in the ordinary course of business we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other claims we have been and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions with a focus on customer relationship management or crm we introduced our first crm solution in february 2000 and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions features and platform capabilities 

our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways our customer success platform  including sales force automation customer service and support marketing automation digital commerce community management analytics application development internet of things “iot” integration and collaborative productivity tools  provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world key elements of our strategy include 

 in addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses services and technologies and intellectual property rights this evaluation resulted in a significant increase in our acquisition activity during fiscal 2017 

we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by thirdparty cloud computing platform providers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities specifically in our top markets continuing to develop our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the development of new services such as the introduction of our analytics cloud community cloud and iot cloud the integration of new and acquired technologies such as commerce cloud artificial intelligence technologies and salesforce quip the expansion of our marketing cloud and salesforce platform formerly app cloud core service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including analytics ecommerce artificial intelligence and the internet of things we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions such as our july 2016 acquisition of demandware inc “demandware” a digital commerce leader we have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have reduced our operating income we remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2017  and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2018 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month our current attrition rate calculation does not include the marketing and commerce cloud service offerings our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended january 31 2017  which is comparable to the eight and nine percent attrition rate during the same period a year ago while it is difficult to predict we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 47  percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017  and 49 percent  for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base sell more products to existing customers and build greater brand awareness 

in july 2016 we acquired demandware an industryleading provider of enterprise cloud commerce solutions in the digital commerce market we acquired demandware to expand our position in customer relationship management and to pursue the digital commerce market segment with the new salesforce commerce cloud the financial results of demandware are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the total purchase price for demandware was approximately 29 billion  

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement the “term loan credit agreement” which provides for a 5000 million  term loan the “term loan” that matures on july 11 2019 all amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for demandware additionally we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the “revolving loan credit agreement” with wells fargo bank national association and certain other institutional lenders that increased our existing revolving credit facility dated october 2014 to 10 billion as of january 31 2017  there was 2000 million  of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

in august 2016 we acquired the outstanding stock of quip inc “quip” quip combines content and communication to create living documents to allow workteams to write edit and discuss documents spreadsheets and checklists in a single experience the total purchase price for quip was approximately 4120 million  

in november 2016 we acquired the outstanding stock of krux digital inc “krux” krux is a leading data management platform that unifies segments and activates audiences to increase engagement with users prospects and customers the total purchase price for krux was approximately 7418 million  

prior to these and other acquisitions during fiscal 2017 our most significant acquisition was exacttarget inc in fiscal 2014 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2017  for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2017  

operating segments 

we operate as one operating segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker who in our case is the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance over the past few years including fiscal 2017 we have completed a number of acquisitions these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments including as a result of the companys acquisitions our business operates in one operating segment because 

the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way and   our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis since we operate as one operating segment all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 92 percent  of our total revenues for fiscal 2017  subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials fixed fee or subscription basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below 

revenue by cloud service offering 

the information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings 

all of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings subscription and support revenues consisted of the following in millions 



subscription and support revenues from the analytics cloud community cloud iot cloud commerce cloud and salesforce quip were not significant analytics cloud iot cloud and salesforce quip revenue is included with salesforce platform and other in the table above community cloud revenue is included in either sales cloud service cloud or salesforce platform and other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased commerce cloud revenue 

resulting from our demandware acquisition in july 2016 is included in marketing cloud as required under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from demandware at fair value as a result we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity of the 9333 million subscription and support revenue for marketing cloud for the fiscal year 2017 approximately 11 percent was attributed to our demandware acquisition to the extent demandware contracts are renewed following the acquisition we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the respective contractual periods 

in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings such as through an enterprise license agreement we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract we have allocated approximately 13 percent  of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2017  and 10 percent  for fiscal 2016  based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above 

additionally some of our service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or our salesforce platform to record account and contact information which are similar features across these core service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful 

our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues as a result sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings conversely revenue for marketing cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement 

the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time while we are a market leader in each core offering we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers accordingly the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent  of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles approximately 80 percent  of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2017  which is consistent with fiscal 2016  occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below in thousands except unbilled deferred revenue 





  



1 operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we adopted accounting standards update no 201609 “stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharedbased payment accounting” “asu 201609” which addresses among other items updates to the presentation and treatment of excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation on the statements of cash flows we have adopted changes to the statement of cash flows on a retrospective basis and have accordingly updated the operating cash flow amounts presented above 

2 unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our noncancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue 

unbilled deferred revenue an operational measure 

the us gaap deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table above our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels as we recognize revenue deferred revenue and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sellthrough to an end user customer unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customers minimum commitment 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors certain third party fees and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues additionally as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology services or data or as our sales volume grows the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters however the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues will affect our general and administrative expenses 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

during fiscal 2017  we recognized stockbased expense of 8204 million  as of january 31 2017  the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was 26 billion  we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 9805 million  during fiscal 2018  7629 million  during fiscal 2019  5405 million  during fiscal 2020  2497 million  during fiscal 2021  174 million  during fiscal 2022  172 million  during fiscal 2023  80 million  during fiscal 2024  the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2017  and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

our professional services contracts are either on a time and materials fixedfee or subscription basis as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services the milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multiple deliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions premium support and professional services if the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual installments the deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2017  we deferred 4620 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 3715 million  to sales expense during fiscal 2016  we deferred 3800 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 3191 million  to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 5396 million  at january 31 2017  and 4491 million  at january 31 2016  

capitalized internaluse software costs  we are required to follow the guidance of accounting standards codification 350 “asc 350” intangibles goodwill and other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internaluse and the accounting for webbased product development costs asc 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs which are incurred during the application development stage and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset we deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems as a result of this software as a service delivery model we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard 

costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 

stockbased expense we recognize stockbased expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period of the awards which is generally the vesting term of four years  we recognize stockbased expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 employee stock purchase plan “espp” on a straightline basis over the offering period which is 12 months  

stockbased expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straightline basis over the service period of the awards which is generally the vesting term of three years 

we at times grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment and as a result we have accounted for them as postacquisition stockbased expense we recognize stockbased expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the awards 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

in the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations 

goodwill and intangibles we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected 

attrition rates discount rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans andor tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

strategic investments  we hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence as defined in accounting standards codification 323 “asc 323” investments  equity method and joint ventures marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and nonmarketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost if based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and nonmarketable securities relate we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments 

we determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the nonmarketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available to us valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

if the fair value of an investment is below our cost we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis which includes the severity and duration of the impairment if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment

the cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  by 419 million  and 40 million  respectively the increase is primarily due to the growth in our headcount as well as the increase in employee costs for our subscription professional services employees we expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

operating expenses

general and administrative expenses were 9676 million  or 11 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2017  compared to 7482 million  or 11 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 2193 million  the increase was primarily due to an increase of 1752 million  in employeerelated costs an increase of 309 million  in stockbased expense and an increase in professional and outside services our general and administrative headcount increased by 22  percent since january 31 2016  as we added personnel to support our growth

benefit from provision for income taxes 



we reported a tax benefit  of 1542 million  on a pretax income of 254 million  which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 608 percent  for fiscal 2017  the most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of 2103 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of demandware the net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance the tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the united states additionally as a result of early adopting accounting standards update no 201609 “stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharedbased payment accounting” “asu 201609” and our valuation allowance position we did not record significant us current income tax expense

expense in the united states we had us current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess 

tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock 

we regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income as well as prudent and feasible taxplanning strategies generally more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence such as the cumulative loss in recent years we will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years for example if the trend in increasing taxable income continues our valuation allowance could contribute to the volatility of our effective tax rate and is difficult to forecast in future periods

our working capital accounts consist of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable deferred commissions prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses deferred revenue and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheet the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers as such our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter

the financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445000 rentable square feet of office space in san francisco california as of january 31 2017  2203 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation  leased facility of which the current portion is included in “accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities” and the noncurrent portion is included in “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

in april 2014 we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732000 rentable square feet of an office building located in san francisco california that is under construction the lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately 5900 million  over the 155 year term of the lease beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 which is reflected above under operating leases 

in february 2016 we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space in new york new york the amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately 2880 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 in may 2016 we entered into an agreement to lease additional office space in indianapolis indiana the amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately 770 million over the approximately 13 year term of the agreement beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018 

during fiscal 2017  and in future fiscal years we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights to facilitate these acquisitions or investments we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

we primarily conduct our business in the following locations the united states europe canada asia south america and australia the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar “usd” these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

our european revenue operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom subsidiary which has a functional currency of the british pound this results in a twostep currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements as an example revenues in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd our statement of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the remeasurement of nonfunctional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multiyear subscriptions in multiple currencies customer trade accounts intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative 

we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 “asc 815” derivatives and hedging accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 

foreign currency translation risk 

fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities revenues operating expense and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars as the us dollar strengthened against certain international currencies over the past several months the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in us dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were lower relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 22 billion  at january 31 2017  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2017  could result in a 130 million  market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 27 billion  the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 209 million  

market risk and market interest risk 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions 

in march 2013 we issued the 025 senior notes due april 1 2018 holders of the 025 senior notes may convert the 025 senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 025 senior notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the 025 senior notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 025 senior notes 

the 025 senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 025 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 025 senior notes however the value of the 025 senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair values of our fixed interest rate 025 senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our 025 senior notes is affected by our stock price the principal balance of our 025 senior notes was 115 billion  as of january 31 2017  the total estimated fair value of our 025 senior notes at january 31 2017   

was 15 billion  the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the 025 senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  which was 12652   

in july 2016 we amended our credit agreement the “revolving loan credit agreement” to provide for a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” that matures in july 2021 

the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175 in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit facility we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of 0125 to 025 with such rate being based on the our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period payable in arrears quarterly as of january 31 2017  there was a 2000 million  outstanding borrowing amount under the credit agreement the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the credit facility was 19  for fiscal 2017  subsequent to january 31 2017  we paid the remaining balance of the credit facility 

in february 2015 we assumed a 2000 million loan with the acquisition of 50 fremont the “loan” the loan bears an interest rate of 375 per annum and is due in june 2023 the loan requires interest only payments with the remaining principal due at maturity the loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee the agreement governing the loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of january 31 2017  

in july 2016 we entered into a 5000 million term loan the “term loan” which matures in july 2019 and bears interest at our option at either a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175 in each case with such spread being determined based on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period we entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of demandware interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate the term loan is payable in july 2019 with the outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity 

by entering into the term loan we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 18  as of january 31 2017  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 

the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 180 privately held companies primarily comprised of isvs and system integrators we invest in earlytolate stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives which include among other things extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the nextgeneration of mobile applications and connected products we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions the americas europe and asia pacific our investments in these companies range from 02 million to over 700 million  with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of 10 million as of january 31 2017  and january 31 2016  the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was 5260 million  and 5045 million  respectively the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was 7583 million  and 7141 million  as of january 31 2017  and january 31 2016  respectively the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary which could be material we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital

tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2017  based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework  2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of demandware inc “demandware” which we acquired in july 2016 as discussed in note 6 “business combinations” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of demandware in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenues subject to demandware’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately one percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017 total assets subject to demandwares internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated total asset excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of january 31 2017  total net assets subject to demandwares internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated net assets excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of january 31 2017  

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2017  we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2017  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

our objective is to deliver solutions that transform how companies sell service market and innovate to connect with their customers in a whole new way not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners build and customize their own apps

expanding our worldclass sales organization  we believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size we will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions primarily through our direct sales force we have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service 

reducing customer attrition our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms we run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers 

building our business in top software markets globally which includes building partnerships that help add customers we believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our solutions globally we plan to continue to aggressively market and sell to customers worldwide via local sales and support professionals with deep expertise in target industries and through partnerships with other enterprise software vendors isvs and system integrators additionally we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers 

encouraging the development of thirdparty applications on our cloud computing platforms the app cloud enables existing customers isvs and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloudbased apps it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange our online marketplace for business apps or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture 

multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance yet their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants our multitenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

multitenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent incremental improvements to our services benefiting the entire user community 

our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than onpremise software that must be written to the different hardware operating systems and database platforms existing within a customer’s unique systems environment our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform 

our efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality performance availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology as part of our business strategy we periodically acquire companies or technologies and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions performance functional depth security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

our customers access our services from any geography over the internet via all of the major internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems 

we provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries these thirdparty data center providers provide space physical security continuous power and cooling the remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer infrastructure as a service including servers storage databases and networking 

sources of revenue 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service we also derive revenues from premier support which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual installments deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing size and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

digital transactions 

our digital transaction volume representing transactions processed through our solutions and platform excluding marketing cloud and one of our platform service offerings heroku was 976 billion  for fiscal 2016 an increase of 67 percent  as compared to fiscal 2015 a transaction is a retrieval or update within the salesforce database which can be a page load an information query or an api call among other things 

our transaction metrics are used to illustrate the growing usage of our service by our customers and to highlight the scalability of our service we do not believe such transaction metrics are key performance indicators of our financial condition specifically there is no direct correlation between the transaction activity and our financial results such as our revenue or expense growth and changes in our operating cash flow balances and deferred revenue balances additionally such transaction activity cannot be relied upon as an indicator of future financial performance 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 26  percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

strategic investments 

since 2009 we have been investing in earlytolate stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives which include among other things extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the nextgeneration of mobile applications and connected products our minority investments in over 150 companies as of january 31 2016 also help us stay connected with the pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry in some cases we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested 

because of the inherent risk in investing in earlytolate stage technology companies our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital 

direct sales 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects 

this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and regional partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer also included in this network are isvs whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals 

we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee which can include services such as priority access to technical resources developer support and system administration in addition we offer a mission critical support addon that is 

designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customers specific enterprise architecture and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our service offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps including crm collaboration and business intelligence software we also compete with internally developed apps we may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors as well as startup and midsized companies focused on disruption who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they may become a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

employees 

as of january 31 2016 we had more than 19000 employees none of our employees in the united states is represented by a labor union however for certain foreign subsidiaries workers’ councils represent our employees

risk factors 

tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability while we have security measures in place they may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it data our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data our data or our it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services because we do not control our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in and experienced disruptions to our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in services from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data are currently replicated in near realtime in a separate facility located elsewhere companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct as well as local administrative actions changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services even with disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements our services could be interrupted 

when we add data centers and add capacity we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage and use of personal information in some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s data protection directive and the countryspecific laws and regulations that implement that directive also govern the processing of personal information further laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes such as the european union’s eprivacy directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers ability to deploy our solutions globally for example in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states while other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain the invalidation of the useu safe harbor framework may result in different european data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data which could result in increased regulation cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for salesforce and its customers the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services reduce overall demand for our services lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for noncompliance or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions any of which could harm our business 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

furthermore concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business and results further there are various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa and related federal communication commission fcc orders the interpretation of many of these statutes regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business and adversely affect our results 

in some cases industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in or failures of our services and may be difficult to replace 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in or a failure of our services which could harm our business these hardware software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps including crm collaboration and business intelligence software we also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments otherthantemporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results 

we invest in earlytolate stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and may not realize a return on our strategic investments many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop and therefore are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment which could be material we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition 

• difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations technologies services and personnel 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

 any of these risks could harm our business in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 14 

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that historical quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a data center contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that historical periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the markets for our analytics communities and internet of things clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades including our conversion to our new lightning platform and introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internetrelated and other technology trends and developments early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments our business could be harmed 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business historically sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 16 

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer 

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our services without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell all of which could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

we conduct our business in the following locations united states europe canada asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets this exposure is the 

result of selling in multiple currencies growth in our international investments including data center expansion additional headcount in foreign locations and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen against the us dollar these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure data center capacity research customer support and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers including governmental entities we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights for example during fiscal 2015 we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents while we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful in addition positions the company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture or aloha spirit which fosters dialogue collaboration recognition and a sense of family as our organization grows we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future success 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively affect our rate of growth in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stockbased expense changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom and australia other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development recently released final guidance covering various topics including transfer pricing countrybycountry reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in nonincome taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a high level of debt including the 025 convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 the “ 025  senior notes” due april 1 2018 the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 fremont and capital lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes finally we have a revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to 6500 million as of january 31 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility our maintenance of this indebtedness and any additional issuance of indebtedness could 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 

a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

the new lease accounting guidance places operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020 which results in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced 

volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes in addition if a holder converts its notes we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes which could harm our reputation financing opportunities and our business 

the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

  

the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes if however the price of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions 

the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities however could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities once commenced will not be discontinued without notice the counterparties or their affiliates may 

choose to engage in or discontinue engaging in any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

legal proceedings 

tableend in the ordinary course of business we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other claims we have been and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

in july 2015 we and certain of our current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the superior court for the state of california county of san francisco the plaintiff filed an amended version of this derivative complaint in november 2015 the derivative complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service and included allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors compensation as well as reform of our equity plan because the complaint was derivative in nature it did not seek monetary damages from us in february 2016 the parties agreed to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as to the plaintiff and submitted a stipulation to that effect to the court in march 2016 the court entered the order of dismissal neither we nor the individual defendants paid any consideration to the plaintiff 

during fiscal 2015 we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future the resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but it could be material to operating results or cash flows or both of a particular quarter 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities specifically in our top markets continuing to develop our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the development of new services such as the announcement of our analytics cloud community cloud and internet of things or iot cloud the integration of acquired technologies the expansion of our marketing cloud and app cloud core service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as a result of our aggressive growth plans specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis as we continue with our growth plan we may continue to have net losses on a gaap basis in some future quarters we remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2016  and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017 our operating margin for fiscal 2016  was 1149  million compared to a 1456  million loss during the same period a year ago 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month our current attrition rate calculation does not include the marketing cloud service offerings our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended january 31 2016  which is favorable compared to the nine to ten percent attrition rate as of january 31 2015  we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 49  percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2016  and 51 percent  for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base sell more products to existing customers and build greater brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2016  for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2016  

operating segments 

we operate as one operating segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker who in our case is the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance over the past few years we have completed several acquisitions these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way and   our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis since we operate as one operating segment all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent  of our total revenues for fiscal 2016  subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting estimates—revenue recognition” below 

revenue by cloud service offering 

we are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings 

subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering in millions 



subscription and support revenues from the analytics cloud and communities cloud were not significant for fiscal 2016 since the launch of iot cloud in september 2015 we have been piloting this offering with several enterprises analytics cloud revenue is included with app cloud and other in the table above communities cloud revenue is included in either sales cloud service cloud or app cloud and other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased 

in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings such as through an enterprise license agreement we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract we have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2016  and 2015  based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above 

additionally some of our service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or our app cloud to record account and contact information which are similar features across these core service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful 

our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues as a result sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings conversely revenue for marketing cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement we estimate that for fiscal 2017  subscription and support revenues from the sales cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on sales cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2016  which is consistent with fiscal 2015 occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below in thousands except unbilled deferred revenue 

  





  



1 operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above 

  

unbilled deferred revenue a nongaap measure 

the gaap deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue is a nongaap operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 71 billion  as of january 31 2016  and approximately 57 billion  as of january 31 2015  our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels as we recognize revenue deferred revenue and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sellthrough to an end user customer 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues additionally as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology services or data or as our sales volume grows the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

during fiscal 2016  we recognized stockbased expense of 5936 million  as of january 31 2016  the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was 16 billion  we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 6261 million  during fiscal 2017  4810 million  during fiscal 2018  3406 million  during fiscal 2019  and 1571 million  during fiscal 2020  the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2016  and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multiple deliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions premium support and professional services if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual installments the deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing size and new business linearity within the quarter 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2016  we deferred 3800 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 3191 million  to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 3209 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 2576 

million  to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 4491 million  at january 31 2016  and 3882 million  at january 31 2015  

capitalized internaluse software costs  we are required to follow the guidance of accounting standards codification 350 “asc 350” intangibles goodwill and other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internaluse and the accounting for webbased product development costs asc 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs which are incurred during the application development stage and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset we deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems as a result of this software as a service delivery model we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard 

costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

goodwill and intangibles  we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected attrition rates discount rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date at each of the interim financial reporting periods we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period the estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans andor tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

strategic investments  we hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence as defined in accounting standards codification 323 “asc 323” investments  equity method and joint ventures marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and nonmarketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost and presented in the consolidated balance sheet if based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and nonmarketable securities relate we apply the requirements of asc 323 to account for such investments 

we determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and nonmarketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the nonmarketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available to us valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data 

if the fair value of an investment is below our cost we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis which includes the severity and duration of the impairment if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment

unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 71 billion  as of january 31 2016  and 57 billion  as of january 31 2015  unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our noncancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue 

fiscal years ended january 31 2016  and 2015   

revenues 



total revenues were 67 billion  for fiscal 2016  compared to 54 billion  during the same period a year ago an increase  of 13 billion  or 24 percent  on a constant currency basis total revenues grew 27  percent subscription and support revenues were 62 billion  or 93 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2016  compared to 50 billion  or 93 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 12 billion  or 24 percent  the increase  in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016  was primarily attributable to volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers our attrition rate which is favorable compared to the prior year also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped improve our attrition rate changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented professional services and other revenues were 4616 million  or seven percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2016  compared to 3598 million  or seven percent  of total revenues for the same period a year ago an increase  of 1018 million  or 28 percent  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 18 billion  or 26 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2016  compared to 15 billion  or 28 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 2512 million  or 17 percent  the increase  in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service our focus on marketing our services internationally additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above revenues outside of the americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016  despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar which reduced aggregate international revenues by 1705 million  compared to fiscal 2015 we expect revenues outside of the americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2017 by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro british pound japanese yen and australian dollar 

cost of revenues   



cost of revenues was 17 billion  or 25 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2016  compared to 13 billion  or 24 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 3653 million  the increase  in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1279 million  in employeerelated costs an increase of 156 million  in stockbased expenses an increase of 1372 million  in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of 406 million  in professional and outside services an increase in depreciation of equipment and an increase in allocated overhead offset by a decrease of 94 million  in amortization of purchased intangibles we have increased our headcount by 34 percent  since january 31 2015  to meet the higher demand for services from our customers we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity additionally the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies we also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

the cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2016 by 40 million as compared to 48 million during the same period a year ago we expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

research and development   



research and development expenses were 9463 million  or 14 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2016  compared to 7929 million  or 15 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 1534 million  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1140 million  in employeerelated costs an increase of 82 million  in stockbased expense an increase of 182 million  in development and test data center expense and an increase in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 16 percent  since january 31 2015  in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

marketing and sales

investment income

we regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income as well as prudent and feasible taxplanning strategies generally more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence such as the cumulative loss in recent years we had a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome we will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years due to our valuation allowance the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods 

fiscal years ended january 31 2015 and 2014

we reported a tax provision of 496 million on a pretax loss of 2131 million which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 23 percent for the fiscal 2015 we had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the united states which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by exacttarget in certain state jurisdictions 

we recorded a tax benefit of 1258 million with a pretax loss of 3579 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014 due to the exacttarget acquisition a deferred tax liability was established for the booktax basis difference related to purchased intangibles the net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets as a result we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of 1431 million  for fiscal 2014 

we had a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence

at january 31 2016  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 27 billion  and accounts receivable of 25 billion  

net cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion  during fiscal 2016  and 12 billion  during the same period a year ago cash provided by operating activities were affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization loss on the conversions of convertible senior notes amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations amortization of debt discount the expense associated with stockbased awards and specifically for fiscal 2016 gains related to the termination of 50 fremont lease and the additional sales of our land in mission bay and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of payments against accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows and changes in working capital accounts 

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheet the operating cash 

flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers as such our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

net cash used in investing activities was 15 billion  during fiscal 2016  and 6984 million  during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016  primarily related to capital expenditures including strategic investments business combinations purchase of 50 fremont land and building new office buildouts investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of mission bay land the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 fremont land and building net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016  increased by approximately 7895 million  over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of 50 fremont land and building and strategic investments

remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 201409” which amended the existing fasb accounting standards codification this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts the fasb deferred the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under us gaap for one year in accordance with the deferral asu 201409 will be effective for fiscal 2019  including interim periods within that reporting period we are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commission balances 

in september 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201516 “simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments topic 805” “asu 201516” which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations asu 201516 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment including the impact on prior periods be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 201516 on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201602 “leases topic 842” “asu 201602” which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice asu 201602 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a righttouse asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures for statement of operations and sharecount information 

regulation sk item 10e “use of nongaap financial measures in commission filings” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information our measures of nongaap net income nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap free cash flow and nongaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure we use the below nongaap financial measures to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in addition to our gaap measures we use these nongaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating our performance we believe that these nongaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude certain expenses and benefits these items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but are made for our longterm benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 

nongaap net income 

we define nongaap net income as our total net income excluding the components described below which we believe are not reflective of our core ongoing operating results in each case for the reasons set forth below we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as we do in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and in better understanding the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance 

 55 

additionally as significant unusual or discrete events occur or as other events occur that are not related to the company’s core ongoing operating results we may exclude the financial results of these events from nongaap net income in the period in which such events occur for example we could in the future recognize a significant gain or loss in connection with one or more of our strategic investments which may not be viewed by management as reflective of our core ongoing operating results similarly the financial effects of significant facilitiesrelated transactions may in the future be excluded from nongaap net income in the period in which such events may occur if they are not viewed by management as reflective of our core ongoing operating results 

nongaap gross profit 

we define nongaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues 

nongaap operating profit 

we define nongaap operating profit as our nongaap gross profit less operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses amortization of purchased intangibles and gain resulting from termination of our office lease that are included in operating expenses 

nongaap earnings per share 

management uses the nongaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 

we define nongaap earnings per share as our nongaap net income divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 

nongaap free cash flow 

we define the nongaap measure free cash flow as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this purpose capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 fremont land and building and building in progress  leased facilities 

limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures 

a limitation of our nongaap financial measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income nongaap earnings per share and nongaap free cash flow is that they do not have uniform definitions our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies including peer companies and therefore comparability may be limited thus our nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income nongaap earnings per share and nongaap free cash flow should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with gaap additionally in the case of stockbased expense if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stockbased expense the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 

we compensate for these limitations by reconciling our nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure we encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our nongaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 

our reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures are as follows in thousands except for share numbers 









a reported gaap loss per share was calculated using the basic share count nongaap diluted earnings per share was calculated using the diluted share count 

nongaap operating profit for the year ended january 31 2016  was 8300 million  and 5741 million  for the same period a year ago an improvement of 2559 million or 45 percent during fiscal 2016 we remained focused on improving nongaap operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017 

the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earningsloss per share for the years ended january 31 2016  2015  and 2014  because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been antidilutive the following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the gaap earningsloss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the nongaap diluted earnings per share 

  



 

  supplemental tax expense benefit information 

as described above beginning in february 2014 which was the start of our fiscal 2015 we changed the methodology used to calculate our nongaap tax expense we computed and utilized a fixed longterm projected nongaap tax rate of 365 percent for fiscal 2015 we moved to this longterm projected nongaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of nonrecurring and periodspecific items as a result we believe that starting in fiscal 2015 providing a tabular reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure of tax expense benefit to the comparable gaap measure is not appropriate given our new methodology 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we recorded for gaap purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets during fiscal 2014 we recorded a partial valuation allowance release primarily in connection with the acquisition of exacttarget the increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the gaap valuation allowance and the company’s increasing acquisition activities the following table for fiscal 2014 reflects the calculation of our nongaap tax expense 



1 the company excluded stockbased expenses amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount net in reporting its nongaap net income accordingly the company excluded the related tax effects of these items the related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction 

2 during fiscal 2014 california mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state which significantly reduced the company’s california income tax expense accordingly for computing nongaap tax expense the company did not 

recognize tax benefits related to certain california research and development tax credits as the company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered california income tax expense 

3 during fiscal 2014 the company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its nongaap tax expense the majority of this adjustment was attributable to noncash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles this noncash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these noncash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period but were made for the company’s long term benefit over multiple periods the remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions which amount was not material the related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 27 billion  at january 31 2016  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2016  could result in a 209 million  market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2015  we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 19 billion  the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 135 million  

market risk and market interest risk 

in march 2013 we issued the 025 senior notes holders of the 025 senior notes may convert the 025 senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 025 senior notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the 025 senior notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 025 senior notes 

the 025 senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 025 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 025 senior notes however the value of the 025 senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair values of our fixed interest rate 025 senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our 025 senior notes is affected by our stock price the principal balance of our 025 senior notes was 115 billion  as of january 31 2016  the total estimated fair value of our 025 senior notes at january 31 2016  was 14 billion  the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the 025 senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  which was 11924   

in october 2014 we entered into the credit agreement which provides for the 6500 million credit facility that matures in october 2019 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate formula as defined in the credit agreement or a libor based formula each as set forth in the credit agreement additionally we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0125 and 025 interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly as of january 31 2016  there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit agreement 

by entering into the credit agreement we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate as defined in the credit agreement or libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions therefore our deposits at times may exceed federally insured limits 

the bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 150 privately held companies primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators we invest in earlytolate stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives which include among other things extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the nextgeneration of mobile applications and connected products we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions the americas europe and asia pacific our investments in these companies range from 02 million to over 700 million  with 14 investments individually equal to or in excess of 10 million as of january 31 2016  and january 31 2015  the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was 5045 million  and 1580 million  respectively the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was 7141 million  and 2800 million  as of january 31 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary which could be material we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital

controls and procedures 

tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2016  based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework  2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2016  we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2016  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because 

of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we believe that the convergence of cloud social mobile and data science technologies is fundamentally transforming how companies sell service market engage and innovate 

cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps instead companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an internet browser or mobile device on an asneeded basis without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software inhouse 

the broad shift to social networking has transformed the way people engage and collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people and products through “feeds” and notifications in addition the proliferation of mobile phones worldwide continues and enterprise mobile apps are making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones as more people and devices become connected companies are looking for new ways to harness the multitude of data from these connections for new insights to drive business success progress in data science and machine learning will move companies beyond just automating business processes to more datadriven predictive computing

professional services

business benefits of using our solution 

the key advantages of our solution include 

secure private scalable and reliable  our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance reliability and security we have built and continue to invest in a comprehensive security infrastructure including firewalls intrusion detection systems and encryption for transmissions over the internet which we monitor and test on a regular basis we built and maintain a multitenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely reliably and cost effectively our multitenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously 

rapid deployment our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring installing or maintaining the servers storage networking equipment security products or other hardware and software 

ease of integration and configuration it professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly we provide a set of application programming interfaces “apis” that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing thirdparty custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions for example many of our customers use our salesforce1 platform api to move customerrelated data from customdeveloped and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities 

high levels of user adoption we have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications as a result our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training we have also designed our solutions to be used on mobile devices making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones 

rapid development of apps using the salesforce1 platform our customers and thirdparty developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multitenant platform we provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs and also support a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them via multiple mobile devices 

increased innovation by providing infrastructure and development environments on demand we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution developers with ideas for a new app can create test and support their solutions on the salesforce1 platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to customers 

lower total cost of ownership we enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract because we deploy all upgrades on our servers new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately 

our strategy 

our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell service market engage and innovate not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build and customize apps 

key elements of our strategy include 

strengthening our solutions we offer multiple editions of our solutions at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality we intend to continue to extend all editions of our core solutions with new features and functions and increased security through our own development acquisitions and partnerships 

expanding into new and highgrowth categories as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new and highgrowth categories including marketing communities business intelligence and cloud platforms 

extending strategic relationships with existing customers  we see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers as our customers realize the benefits of our service we aim to upgrade the customer to premium editions extend the duration of the customers contracts and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and ultimately pursue enterprisewide deployments 

pursuing new customers  we believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size as a result we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions primarily through our direct sales force we have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service 

reducing attrition our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms we run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers 

building our business in top software markets globally we believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our solutions globally we plan to continue to aggressively market and sell to customers worldwide via local sales and support professionals with deep expertise in target industries and through partnerships with isvs and system integrators additionally we plan to increase data center capacity by opening additional data centers in our top global markets 

encouraging the development of thirdparty apps on our cloud computing platforms the salesforce1 platform enables existing customers isvs and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloud apps it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange our online marketplace for business apps or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloudcomputing application and platform services on a multitenant technology architecture 

multitenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance yet their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants our multitenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications multitenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent incremental improvements to our services benefiting the entire user community 

our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than onpremise software that must be written to the different hardware operating systems and database platforms existing within a customer’s unique systems environment our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology as part of our business strategy we periodically acquire companies or technologies and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions performance functional depth and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction 

our customers access our services from any geography over the internet via all of the major internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems 

we provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries these thirdparty data center providers provide space physical security continuous power and cooling the remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer infrastructure as a service including servers storage databases and networking 

sources of revenue 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service we also derive revenues from premier support which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual installments deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing size and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

transactions 

our transaction volume representing transactions processed through our solutions and platform excluding marketing cloud and one of our platform service offerings heroku was 585 billion for fiscal 2015 an increase of 59 percent as compared to fiscal 2014 a transaction is a retrieval or update within the salesforce database which can be a page load an information query or an api call among others 

our transaction metrics are used to illustrate the growing usage of our service by our customers and to highlight the scalability of our service we do not believe transaction metrics are key performance indicators of our financial condition specifically there is no direct correlation between the transaction activity and our financial results such as revenue or expense growth additionally transaction activity cannot be relied upon as an indicator of future financial performance 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 28 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

direct sales 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects 

this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and regional partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer also included in this network are isvs whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals 

we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support for an additional fee which can include services such as priority access to technical resources developer support and system administration in addition we offer a mission critical support addon that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customers specific enterprise architecture and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and our first quarter is historically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally thirdparty developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering crm apps we also compete with internally developed apps we may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they may become a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings 

employees 

as of january 31 2015 we had more than 16000 employees none of our employees in the united states is represented by a labor union however for certain foreign subsidiaries workers’ councils represent our employees

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our services and new errors in our services may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in services from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers all of which would reduce our revenue our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located in the united states companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services even with disaster recovery arrangements our services could be interrupted 

as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services which may damage our business 

if our security measures or those of our thirdparty data center hosting facilities cloud computing platform providers or thirdparty service partners are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our data or our it systems our services may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability while we have security measures in place they may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it data our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data our data or our it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services because we do not control our customers or thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

• potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition 

• difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations technologies services and personnel 

• diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations 

 10 

 any of these risks could harm our business in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock also valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value we may be required to record an impairment which could negatively impact our financial results 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage and use of personal information in some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s data protection directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive also govern the processing of personal information further laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes such as the european union’s eprivacy directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers ability to deploy our solutions globally 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance 

furthermore concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations interpretive positions or standards could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business further there are various statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa the interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our business if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business 

in some cases industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a data center contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that historical periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in or failures of our services and may be difficult to replace 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties in order to offer our services including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in or a failure of our services which could harm our business these hardware software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year as a result our fiscal first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 13 

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that historical quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the markets for our analytics cloud and community cloud remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business historically sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 14 

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our services customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer 

  

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our services without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell all of which could harm our business 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure data center capacity research customer support and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our services to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we may face greater costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business 

for large enterprise customers professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights and commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights for example during fiscal 2015 we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents while we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both further many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity which could negatively affect our rate of growth in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stockbased expense changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals currently being considered by many countries including the united states as well as several european countries 

additionally we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in nonincome taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a high level of debt including our 025 senior notes due april 1 2018 borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital lease arrangements additionally we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet in addition we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes our maintenance of this indebtedness could 

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations further our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 

a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include 

 19 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes in addition if a holder converts its notes we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes which could harm our reputation financing opportunities and our business 

the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

  

the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes if however the price of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions 

the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities however could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities once commenced will not be discontinued without notice the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in or discontinue engaging in any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

legal proceedings 

tableend in the ordinary course of business we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment class actions wage and hour and other claims we have been and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

during fiscal 2015 the company received a communication from a large technology company alleging that the company infringed certain of its patents the company continues to analyze this claim no litigation has been filed to date there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future the resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues expenses results of operations liquidity plans strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements our forwardlooking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k except as required by law we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors for any reason 

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions with a focus on customer relationship management or crm we introduced our first crm solution in february 2000 and we have since expanded our offerings with new editions solutions enhanced features platform capabilities and a new analytics solution through internal development and acquisitions we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis 

our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into “customer companies” by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways with our six core cloud service offerings—sales cloud service cloud marketing cloud communities cloud analytics cloud and the salesforce1 platform—customers have the tools they need to build a next generation customer success platform key elements of our strategy include 

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities specifically in our top markets continuing to develop our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the development of new services such as the announcement of our analytics cloud and community cloud the integration of acquired technologies the expansion of our marketing cloud and salesforce1 platform core service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as a result of our aggressive growth plans specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis as we continue with our growth plan we may continue to have net losses on a gaap basis we remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2015  and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016 our operating loss for fiscal 2015  was 1456  million compared to 2861  million during the same period a year ago 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month our current attrition rate calculation does not include the marketing cloud service offerings our attrition rate was between nine and ten percent during the fiscal year ended january 31 2015  which is consistent with the attrition rate as of january 31 2014  we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 51  percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2015  and 53 percent  for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base sell more products to existing customers and build greater brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2015  for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2015  

operating segments 

we operate as one operating segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker who in our case is the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance over the past few years we have completed several acquisitions these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way and   our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis since we operate as one operating segment all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent  percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2015  subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting estimates—revenue recognition” below 

revenue by cloud service offering 

we are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings 

subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering in millions 



subscription and support revenues from analytics cloud and communities cloud were not significant for fiscal 2015 analytics cloud revenue is included with salesforce1 platform and other in the table above communities cloud revenue is included in either sales cloud service cloud or salesforce1 platform and other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased 

in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings such as through an enterprise license agreement we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract we have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2015  based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above 

additionally some of our core service offerings have similar features and functions for example customers may use the sales cloud the service cloud or our salesforce1 platform to record account and contact information which are similar features across these core service offerings depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage in addition as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability accordingly comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful 

our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues as a result sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings conversely revenue for marketing cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement we estimate that for fiscal 2016  subscription and support revenues from the sales cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenue and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on sales cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue accounts receivable and operating cash flow 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2015  in comparison to nearly 74 percent during fiscal 2014 occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is historically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below in thousands except unbilled deferred revenue 

  





  



1 operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above 

  

unbilled deferred revenue a nongaap measure 

the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 57 billion  as of january 31 2015  and approximately 45 billion  as of january 31 2014  our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels as we recognize revenue deferred revenue and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sellthrough to an end user customer 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology services and data we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data center capacity in the future as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues additionally as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology services or data or as our sales volume grows the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

during fiscal 2015  we recognized stockbased expense of 5648 million  as of january 31 2015  the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weightedaverage period of 20  years was 14 billion  we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 5566 million  during fiscal 2016  4116 million  during fiscal 2017  2889 million  during fiscal 2018  1274 million  during fiscal 2019  and 05 million during fiscal 2020  the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2015  and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multiple deliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions premium support and professional services if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual installments the deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing size and new business linearity within the quarter 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during the fiscal 2015  we deferred 3209 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 2576 million  to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 2651 million  of commission expenditures and we amortized 1946 million  to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 3882 million  at january 31 2015  and 3249 million  at january 31 2014  

capitalized internaluse software costs  we are required to follow the guidance of accounting standards codification 350 “asc 350” intangibles goodwill and other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internaluse and the accounting for webbased product development costs asc 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs which are incurred during the application development stage and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset we deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems as a result of this software as a service delivery model we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard 

costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 

goodwill and longlived assets  we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected attrition rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as but not limited to a substantial decline in our market capitalization an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and unanticipated competition 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization we evaluate longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset a longlived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if a longlived asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 37 

unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

stockbased options and awards we recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan “espp” the fair value of each option or espp share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased expense in the period of change inputs into the blackscholes option pricing model include 

 income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date at each of the interim financial reporting periods we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period the estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans andor tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

strategic investments  we report our investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privatelyheld companies at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an otherthantemporary decline in value has occurred management evaluates financial results earnings trends technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of otherthantemporary impairment in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privatelyheld companies we utilize the most recent data available to us valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available data

unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 57 billion  as of january 31 2015  and 45 billion  as of january 31 2014  unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our noncancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue 

fiscal years ended january 31 2015  and 2014   

revenues 



total revenues were 54 billion  for fiscal 2015  compared to 41 billion  during the same period a year ago an increase  of 13 billion  or 32 percent  on a constant currency basis total revenues grew 33  percent subscription and support revenues were 50 billion  or 93 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 38 billion  or 94 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 12 billion  or 31 percent  the increase  in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of in fiscal 2015  including exacttarget revenue for the full fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2014  which only included exacttarget revenue as of its acquisition date in july 2013  additionally volumedriven increases from new business which includes new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues our attrition rate which is consistent with the prior year also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped maintain our attrition rate the net price per user per month for our three primary offerings professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition varies from period to period but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented professional services and other revenues were 3598 million  or seven percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 2465 million  or six percent  of total revenues for the same period a year ago an increase  of 1134 million  or 46 percent  the increase  in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of in fiscal 2015  including exacttarget revenue for the full fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2014  which only included exacttarget revenue as of its acquisition date in july 2013  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 15053 million  or 28 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 11712 million  or 29 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 3341 million  or 29 percent  the increase  in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service our focus on marketing our services internationally additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above revenues outside of the americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2015  despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar which reduced aggregate international revenues by 315 million compared to the same period a year ago we expect revenues outside of the americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2016 by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro japanese yen australian dollar and british pound 

cost of revenues   



cost of revenues was 12893 million  or 24 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 9684 million  or 24 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 3208 million  the increase  in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1223 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 82 million  in stockbased expenses an increase of 1006 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of 299 million in professional and outside services an increase of 188 million in allocated overhead and an increase of 447 million in depreciation of property and equipment offset by a decrease of 191 million in amortization of purchased intangibles we have increased our headcount by 30 percent since january 31 2014  to meet the higher demand for services from our customers we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity additionally the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies we also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

the cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2015 by 48 million as compared to 101 million during the same period a year ago primarily due to the impact of including exacttarget revenue for the full fiscal 2015  as described above offset by an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount we expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings 

research and development   



research and development expenses were 7929 million  or 15 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 6238 million  or 15 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 1691 million  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1323 million in employeerelated costs an increase of of 138 million in stockbased expense an increase of 148 million in development and test data center expense and an increase in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 25 percent since january 31 2014  in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

marketing and sales 



marketing and sales expenses were 28 billion  or 51 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 22 billion  or 53 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase  of 5890 million  the increase  in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of 4390 million in employeerelated costs including amortization of deferred commissions 564 million in advertising expenses and event costs 278 million stockbased expense 52 million in professional and outside services and 280 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent since january 31 2014  the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses were 6799 million  or 13 percent  of total revenues for fiscal 2015  compared to 5967 million  or 15 percent  of total revenues during the same period a year ago a increase  of 832 million  the increase was primarily due to an increase of 531 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 189 million in equipment costs and an increase of 117 million in stockbased expense offset by a decrease of 30 million in professional and outside services our general and administrative headcount increased by 9 percent since january 31 2014  as we added personnel to support our growth 

loss from operations 



loss from operations for fiscal 2015  was 1456 million  and included 5648 million  of stockbased expenses and 1550 million  of amortization of purchased intangibles during the same period a year ago loss from operations was 2861 million  and included 5033 million  of stockbased expenses and 1465 million  of amortization of purchased intangibles 

investment income 



investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 100 million  for fiscal 2015  and was 102 million  during the same period a year ago 

interest expense 



interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes capital leases term loan and revolving credit facility interest expense net of interest costs capitalized was 732 million  for fiscal 2015  and was 772 million  during the same period a year ago the decrease  was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 075 convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015 these notes fully matured on january 15 2015 

gain on sales of land and building improvements 

during fiscal 2015  we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate including a portion of our perpetual parking rights in san francisco california we recognized a gain of 156 million during fiscal 2015  net of closing costs as a result of this activity 

other expense 



other expense primarily consists of nonoperating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt the increase in other expense for fiscal 2015  was primarily due to losses totaling  103 million  related to the extinguishment of the 075  senior notes converted by noteholders 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



we reported a tax provision  of 496 million  on a pretax loss of 2131 million  which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 23 percent  for the fiscal 2015  we had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the us which was partially offset by tax benefits from current year losses incurred by exacttarget in certain state jurisdictions 

we recorded a tax benefit  of 1258 million  with a pretax loss of 3579 million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent  for fiscal 2014  due to the exacttarget acquisition a deferred tax liability was established for the booktax basis difference related to purchased intangibles the net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets as a result we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of 1431 million for fiscal 2014 

we had a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized due to the valuation allowance the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods 

fiscal years ended january 31 2014 and 2013 

revenues 



total revenues were 41 billion for fiscal 2014  compared to 31 billion during fiscal 2013  an increase of 10 billion or 33 percent subscription and support revenues were 38 billion or 94 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014  compared to 29 billion or 94 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013  an increase of 9557 million or 33 percent the increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volumedriven increases from new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to fiscal 2013  we have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption have helped reduce our attrition rates the net price per user per month for our three primary offerings professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition varies from period to period but has remained within a consistent range the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented professional services and other revenues were 2465 million or six percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 1814 million or six percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013  an increase of 651 million or 36 percent the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers

cost of revenues 



cost of revenues was 9684 million or 24 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 6836 million or 22 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013  an increase of 2848 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1028 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 489 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity an increase of 804 million in depreciation and amortization expenses 321 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology an increase of 161 million in subcontractor and professional services expense an increase of 231 million in allocated overhead and an increase of 119 million in stockbased expenses we increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since january 31 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers of which the majority was due to the acquisition of exacttarget in june 2013 we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years a portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above 

research and development 



research and development expenses were 6238 million or 15 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 4295 million or 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013  an increase of 1943 million the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of 1149 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 311 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 160 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 172 million in allocated overhead and an increase of 148 million in test data lab costs we increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since january 31 2013 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies the majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of exacttarget in june 2013 we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years a portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above 

marketing and sales 



marketing and sales expenses were 22 billion or 53 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 16 billion or 53 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013  an increase of 5541 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 3571 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 593 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 572 million in advertising marketing and event costs and an increase of 498 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since january 31 2013 the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of exacttarget 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses were 5967 million or 15 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 4338 million or 15 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013  an increase of 1629 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 706 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 217 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 483 million in professional and outside services which included transaction fees associated with the exacttarget acquisition and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since january 31 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth the majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of exacttarget 

loss from operations 



loss from operations for fiscal 2014 was 2861 million and included 5033 million of stockbased expenses and 1465 million of amortization of purchased intangibles during fiscal 2013  operating loss was 1107 million and included 3794 million of stockbased expenses and 882 million of amortization of purchased intangibles 

investment income 



investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 102 million for fiscal 2014 and was 196 million during fiscal 2013  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities balances 

interest expense 



interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes term loan and capital leases interest expense net of interest costs capitalized was 772 million for fiscal 2014 and was 309 million for fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the march 2013 issuance of 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes the 3000 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of exacttarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in june 2013 

benefit from provision for income taxes 



we reported a tax benefit of 1258 million with a pretax loss of 3579 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014 due to the exacttarget acquisition a deferred tax liability was established for the booktax basis difference related to purchased intangibles the net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013  and recorded a tax benefit of 1431 million for fiscal 2014 

we recorded a tax provision of 1427 million on a pretax loss of 1278 million which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of 1868 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 

we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in our evaluation we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence during fiscal 2013 we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of 1868 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2015  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 19 billion  which excludes restricted cash of 1150 million  and accounts receivable of 19 billion  

net cash provided by operating activities was 12 billion  during fiscal 2015  and 8755 million  during the same period a year ago cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stockbased awards the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows and changes in working capital accounts 

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheet the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers as such our first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015  increased 2982 million  over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization loss on conversions of convertible senior notes stockbased expenses and the timing of payments against accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities was 6984 million  during fiscal 2015  and 24 billion  during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015  primarily related to capital expenditures including new office buildouts investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015  decreased by 17 billion  over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisitions of exacttarget inc and edgespring inc during fiscal 2014  offset by cash proceeds from sales of land and building improvements totaling 2232 million and cash acquired of 381 million from business combinations during fiscal 2015  additionally we made deposits totaling 1264 million for the purchase of building and land during fiscal 2015  

net cash used in financing activities was 3105 million  during fiscal 2015  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 16 billion  during the same period a year ago net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015  consisted primarily of 5689 million in principal payments on our 075 convertible senior notes 707 million of principal payments on capital leases and 2850 million of payments on our term loan offset by 3090 million  from proceeds from equity plans and 2973 million  from our revolving credit facility net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015  changed 19 billion  from the same period a year ago primarily due to 11 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and related hedge transactions during fiscal 2014  and an increase of 5629 million in principal payments on our 075 convertible senior notes during fiscal 2015  

in january 2010 we issued 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due january 15 2015 the “075 senior notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “075 note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “075 warrants” on january 15 2015 the 075 senior notes matured upon maturity of the 075 senior notes we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 075 senior notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 075 senior notes as of january 31 2015  there is no remaining principal balance of the 075 senior notes outstanding as a result of the conversions and maturity of the 075  senior notes during fiscal 2015  the company exercised its rights on the 075  note hedges and the 075 note hedges expired additionally in fiscal 2015  the company entered into agreements with each of the 075  warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 075  warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in april 2015 as a result the company issued in the aggregate approximately 133 million  shares to the counterparties to settle via a net share settlement the entirety of the 075  warrants 

in march 2013 we issued 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes due april 1 2018 the “025 senior notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “025 note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “025 warrants” the 025 senior notes will mature on april 1 2018 unless earlier converted upon conversion of any 025 senior notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 025 senior notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 025 senior notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both 

the 025 senior notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 6644 per share applicable to the 025 senior notes the 025 senior notes have not yet been convertible at the holders’ option the 025 senior notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2015  our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 6644 per share applicable to the 025 senior notes during the fiscal quarter ended january 31 2015  accordingly the 025 senior notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2015 and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

in july 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” with bank of america na and certain other lenders which provided for a 3000 million term loan the “term loan” the term loan bore interest at our option under either a liborbased formula or a base rate formula each as set forth in the prior credit agreement on october 6 2014 we repaid the term loan in full and terminated the prior credit agreement 

in october 2014 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” which provides for a 6500 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” that matures in october 2019 immediately upon closing we borrowed 3000 million under the credit facility approximately 2625 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our term loan we may use any future borrowings under the credit facility for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes including permitted acquisitions we may borrow amounts under the credit facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement we may also prepay the borrowings under the credit facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty subject to certain conditions and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate formula or a libor based formula each as set forth in the credit agreement additionally we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0125 and 025 interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly 

the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness dispose of assets make certain acquisition transactions pay dividends or distributions and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the credit agreement we were in compliance with the credit agreement’s covenants as of january 31 2015  

the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was 17 for the period beginning october 6 2014 and ended january 31 2015  as of january 31 2015  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were 3000 million 

in august 2014 we sold approximately 37 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in san francisco for a total of 725 million separately in september 2014 we sold approximately 15 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of 1250 million we have 88 net acres remaining for sale as of january 31 2015 

in february 2015 we acquired 50 fremont street a 41story building totaling approximately 817000 rentable square feet located in san francisco california “50 fremont” we acquired 50 fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in san francisco as of january 31 2015 we were leasing approximately 500000 square feet of the available space in 50 fremont see note 14 “subsequent event” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the total purchase price for 50 fremont was 6293 million to pay for 50 fremont we used 1150 million of restricted cash and assumed a 2000 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations us treasury securities us agency obligations government obligations collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities time deposits money market mutual funds and municipal securities 

as of january 31 2015  we have a total of 638 million  in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and expire at various dates through december 2030 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space colocation data center facilities and our development and test data center as well as leases for computer equipment software furniture and fixtures at january 31 2015  the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands 

  



the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations the financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445000 rentable square feet of office space in san francisco california as of january 31 2015  1253 million  of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation building in progress  leased facility which is included in “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets 

in april 2014 we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 714000 rentable square feet of an office building located in san francisco california that is under construction the lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately 5600 million over the 155 year term of the lease beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 which is reflected above under operating leases 

subsequent to january 31 2015 we acquired 50 fremont as of january 31 2015 we had been leasing approximately 500000 square feet of 50 fremont see note 14 “subsequent event” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the lease which was signed in january 2012 is reflected above under operating lease obligations and the commitment totals 2385 million the operating lease commitment is as follows 161 million during fiscal 2016 166 million during fiscal 2017 171 million during fiscal 2018 176 million during fiscal 2019 181 million during fiscal 2020 and 1530 thereafter beginning in the quarter ending april 30 2015 this commitment will be removed from operating lease obligations 

during fiscal 2015  and in future fiscal years we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months 

new accounting pronouncement 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 201409” which amended the existing fasb accounting standards codification this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts asu 201409 is effective for fiscal 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commissions balances 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation sk item 10e “use of nongaap financial measures in commission filings” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information our measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure 

nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income 

we use the nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in addition to our gaap measures we use these nongaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating our performance we believe that these nongaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude certain expenses and benefits these items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but are made for our longterm benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 

we define nongaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses in each case for the reasons set forth below we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance additionally as significant unusual or discrete events occur the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur 

  

 we define nongaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues 

we define nongaap operating profit as our nongaap gross profit less operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses 

nongaap earnings per share 

management uses the nongaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 

we define nongaap earnings per share as our nongaap net income which excludes the above components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 

limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures 

a limitation of our nongaap financial measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies including peer companies and therefore comparability may be limited thus our nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with gaap additionally in the case of stockbased expense if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stockbased expense the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 

we compensate for these limitations by reconciling nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure we encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our nongaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 

our reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures of gross profit operating profit net income and earnings per share to the most comparable gaap measure “gross profit” “loss from operations” “net income loss” and “net income loss per share” for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  are as follows in thousands except for share numbers 

  









nongaap operating profit for the year ended january 31 2015  was 5741 million and 3637 million for the same period a year ago an improvement of 2104 million or 58 percent during fiscal 2015 we remained focused on improving nongaap operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016 

the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earningsloss per share for the years ended january 31 2015  2014  and 2013  because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been antidilutive the following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the gaap earningsloss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the nongaap diluted earnings per share 

  



  supplemental tax expense benefit information 

as described above beginning in february 2014 which was the start of our fiscal 2015 we changed the methodology used to calculate our nongaap tax expense we have computed and are utilizing a fixed longterm projected nongaap tax rate of 365 percent for fiscal 2015 we moved to this longterm projected nongaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of nonrecurring and periodspecific items as a result we believe that starting in fiscal 2015 providing a tabular reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure of tax expense benefit to the comparable gaap measure is not appropriate given our new methodology 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we recorded for gaap purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets during fiscal 2014 we recorded a partial valuation allowance release primarily in connection with the acquisition of exacttarget the increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the gaap valuation allowance and the company’s increasing acquisition activities the following table for fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflects the calculation of our nongaap tax expense 



1 the company excluded stockbased expenses amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount net in reporting its nongaap net income accordingly the company excluded the related tax effects of these items the related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction 

2 during fiscal 2013 the company evaluated both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets and determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence due to the cumulative gaap loss in recent years and forecasted future gaap losses as a result a valuation allowance was established against a significant portion of the deferred tax assets in q3 fiscal 2013 however a valuation allowance would not be necessary on a nongaap basis given the company’s nongaap operating income as a result the company excluded its gaap valuation allowance recorded during the period when computing its nongaap tax expense 

3 during fiscal 2014 california mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state which significantly reduced the company’s california income tax expense accordingly for computing nongaap tax expense the company did not 

recognize tax benefits related to certain california research and development tax credits as the company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered california income tax expense 

4 during fiscal 2014 the company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its nongaap tax expense the majority of this adjustment was attributable to noncash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles this noncash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these noncash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period but were made for the company’s long term benefit over multiple periods the remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions which amount was not material the related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction 

5 other net included multiple items that were immaterial either on an individual basis or an aggregate basis

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 19 billion  at january 31 2015  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2015  could result in a 135 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

as of january 31 2015  we had restricted cash totaling 1150 million  that was held in a money market account which is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 

at january 31 2014  we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 13 billion  the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 88 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in march 2013 we issued at par value 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes the “025 senior notes” collectively the “notes” holders of the 025 senior notes may convert the 025 senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes for the 025 senior notes the amounts in excess of the principal amounts if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

the 025 senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 025 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair values of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our 025 notes is affected by our stock price the principal balance of our 025 senior notes was 115 billion  as of january 31 2015  the total estimated fair value of our 025 senior notes at january 31 2015  was 13 billion  the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the 025 senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  which was 11087 

in october 2014 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” which provides for a 6500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in october 2019 the “credit facility” immediately upon closing we borrowed 3000 million under the credit facility 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate formula as defined in the credit agreement or a libor based formula each as set forth in the credit agreement additionally we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0125 and 025 interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly 

by entering into the credit agreement we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate as defined in the credit agreement or libor the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was 17 for the period beginning october 6 2014 and ended january 31 2015  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 

we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions therefore our deposits at times may exceed federally insured limits 

the bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of their nonperformance to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process we monitor ratings credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk we adjust our exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privatelyheld companies many of which are in the development stage when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities of the privatelyheld companies using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting our portfolio consists of investments in approximately 100 companies with our investments in these companies ranging from 02 million to 400 million as of january 31 2015  and january 31 2014  the carrying value of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 1580 million  and 770 million  respectively the estimated fair value of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 2800 million  as of january 31 2015

controls and procedures 

tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2015 based on the guidelines established in the internal control—integrated framework  2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2015 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2015 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2015 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the cloud social and mobile revolution

cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps instead companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an internet browser or mobile device on an asneeded basis without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software inhouse 

the broad shift to social networking has transformed the way people collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people and products through “feeds” and status updates there is a significant transition underway from desktops to smartphones and tablets making it possible for people to get business done right from their mobile devices and increasingly customers want to be connected to the products they use

business benefits of using our solution 

the key advantages of our solution include 

secure private scalable and reliable our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance reliability and security we have built and continue to invest in a comprehensive security infrastructure including firewalls intrusion detection systems and encryption for transmissions over the internet which we monitor and test on a regular basis we built and maintain a multitenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely reliably and costeffectively our multitenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously 

rapid deployment our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring installing or maintaining the servers storage networking equipment security products or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary 

ease of integration and configuration it professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly we provide a set of application programming interfaces “apis” that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our 

  

index to financial statements solution with existing thirdparty custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions for example many of our customers use our salesforce1 api to move customerrelated data from customdeveloped and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities 

high levels of user adoption we have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications as a result our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training 

rapid development of apps using the salesforce1 platform our customers and thirdparty developers can develop apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multitenant platform we provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices 

increased innovation by providing infrastructure and development environments on demand we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution a developer with an idea for a new app can log onto our platforms develop test and support their system on the salesforce1 platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to his or her customers 

lower total cost of ownership we enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract because we deploy all upgrades on our servers new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately 

our strategy 

our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell service market and innovate not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build apps 

key elements of our strategy include 

strengthening our solutions we designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality we intend to continue to extend our core solutions with new features and functions and increased security we also offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced crm capabilities we offer a range of editions to meet our customers crm requirements through our own development acquisitions and partnerships we have strengthened and extended our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments in the future 

extending distribution into new and highgrowth categories as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new and highgrowth categories including marketing and cloud platforms we are expanding our footprint in these areas to offer new social and mobile cloud innovations to our customers 

expanding relationships with existing customers we see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers as our customers realize the benefits of our service we aim to upgrade the customer to higher priced editions extend the duration of the customer’s contract and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and ultimately pursue enterprisewide deployments 

pursuing new customers we believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size as a result we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes in top industries primarily 

  

index to financial statements through our direct sales force we have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service 

reducing attrition our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms we run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers 

building our business in top markets globally we also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service globally we plan to continue to aggressively market to customers worldwide in our top global markets by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in the largest enterprise software markets around the world additionally we plan to increase data center capacity by opening additional data centers in our top global markets 

encouraging the development of thirdparty apps on our cloud computing platforms the salesforce1 platform enables existing customers isvs and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloud apps they have built on our multitenant platform it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange our online marketplace for business apps or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our service as a highly scalable multitenant app we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service we have optimized our service to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment as part of our business strategy we periodically acquire companies or technologies and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our service while maintaining the quality and security standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

our service treats all customers as separate tenants in central applications databases and other resources as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

because of our multitenant architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a solution based on a single version of our apps 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features functionality and services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology 

our customers access our service over the internet via all of the major internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems 

we provide our services to our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries 

  

index to financial statements customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 

sources of revenue 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service we also derive revenues from premier support which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

direct sales 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads our small business commercial and enterprise account executives focus their efforts on small midsize and large enterprises respectively 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects 

this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and regional partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer also included in this network are isvs whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals 

we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

  

index to financial statements marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support for an additional fee which includes services such as priority access to technical resources developer support andor system administration 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology frequent introductions of new products and services and as we have seen recently consolidation many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering crm apps we also compete with internally developed apps and may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

 we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will become a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software services documentation and other proprietary information 

employees 

as of january 31 2014 we had more than 13300 employees none of our employees in the united states is represented by a labor union however for certain foreign subsidiaries workers’ councils represent our employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when 

  

index to financial statements first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located in the united states companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our it systems our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability these security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our it systems additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data or it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data because we do not control our customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious thirdparties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services any security breach 

  

index to financial statements could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

as we acquire companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business benefits the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future in july 2013 we acquired exacttarget our largest acquisition in the company’s history acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline 

  

index to financial statements privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business 

regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage and use of personal information in some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations such as the european union’s data protection directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive also govern the processing of personal information further laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes such as the european union’s eprivacy directive and the countryspecific regulations that implement that directive such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions these and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or in some cases impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties such as truste if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business 

the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance 

furthermore concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

industryspecific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business 

our customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries including financial services the public sector healthcare and telecommunications regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by industryspecific laws regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary thirdparty certification bodies that our customers may expect such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standards may have an adverse impact on our business if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industryspecific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers it may harm our business 

in some cases industryspecific laws regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

index to financial statements if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a data center contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors and the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate andor harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the markets for our salesforce1 exacttarget marketing cloud and salesforce1 platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

index to financial statements we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in the normal course of business some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for lower cost editions of our service we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs our business may suffer 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

  

index to financial statements if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure research and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our service to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth 

we regularly upgrade andor replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for 

  

index to financial statements delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business historically sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

  

index to financial statements we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights and commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example we received a notice from a large nonpracticing entity alleging that we infringed upon certain of its patents while no litigation was ever filed in may 2013 we entered into a multiyear license agreement with the nonpracticing entity that covered past period and future nonexclusive rights to its intellectual property 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual 

  

index to financial statements property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we also face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the us also our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforcecom brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

  

index to financial statements we expect to incur net gaap losses in the future 

we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter except one since july 31 2011 in addition we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our longterm benefit such as equity awards and business combinations if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses on a us gaap basis in the future 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods including our outstanding 5750 million in aggregate principal amount of 075 senior notes due january 15 2015 115 billion in aggregate principal amount of 025 senior notes due april 1 2018 3000 million term loan maturing in july 2016 with bank of america na and certain other lenders and capital lease arrangements in excess of 5000 million our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because 

 

  

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 

a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and the term loan any required repayment of our notes andor term loan as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business 

we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco if we do not realize any benefits our financial performance may be negatively impacted 

in november 2010 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land we may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we suspended preconstruction activity on the land if we commence efforts to develop the real estate we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility in the event that we decide to sell this property the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet and our financial results may be negatively impacted 

  

index to financial statements weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our notes and underlying common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our notes and underlying common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our notes and underlying common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our notes and underlying common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes in addition if a holder converts its notes we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority in addition if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion our inability to pay for your notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in your receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes 

the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

  

index to financial statements the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes if however the price of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions 

the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities however could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities once commenced will not be discontinued without notice the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in or discontinue engaging in any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

as of january 31 2014 our executive offices and principal offices for domestic marketing sales professional services and development consist of over 11 million square feet of leased space in the san francisco bay area we also lease space in various locations throughout the united states for local sales and professional services personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel 

we also own approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land we continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and its options for the undeveloped real estate which may include selling a portion of or all the real estate holdings or suspending preconstruction activity for several more years

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour and other claims we have been and may in the future be put on notice andor sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counterclaims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

  

index to financial statements the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions we were founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management or crm applications via the internet or “cloud” we introduced our first crm solution in february 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions solutions and enhanced features through internal development and acquisitions we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis 

our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into “customer companies” by empowering them to connect with their customers partners employees and products in entirely new ways our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell service market and innovate with our four core services—sales cloud service cloud marketing cloud and the salesforce1 platform—customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining 

  

index to financial statements customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities continuing to develop our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the development of new services the integration of acquired technologies the expansion of our salesforce1 exacttarget marketing cloud and salesforce1 platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as a result of our aggressive growth plans specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a gaap basis as we continue with our growth plan we may continue to have net losses on a gaap basis 

our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts are available for renewal we calculate our attrition rates as of the end of each reporting period we do not calculate the attrition rate for exacttarget inc “exacttarget” our attrition rate was in the highsingle digit percentage range as of january 31 2014 declining from the lowdouble digit percentage range attrition rate as of january 31 2013 we expect our attrition rates to continue to decline slowly over time as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and other related programs 

the majority of our subscription and support revenues are derived from subscriptions to our sales cloud 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying customers and build greater brand awareness 

on march 18 2013 we issued at par value 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes due april 1 2018 in connection with the issuance of the debt we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes the note hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion 

on march 20 2013 we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 4000 million to 16 billion in order to provide for a fourforone stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend the record date for the stock split was april 3 2013 and the additional shares were distributed on april 17 2013 each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held all share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split as appropriate 

in june 2013 we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years 

on july 11 2013 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a 3000 million term loan due on july 11 2016 all amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for exacttarget 

  

index to financial statements on july 12 2013 we acquired for cash the outstanding stock of exacttarget a leading global provider of crosschannel digital marketing solutions we acquired exacttarget for the assembled workforce expected synergies and to create a worldclass marketing platform across the channels of email social mobile and the web the financial results of exacttarget are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the total purchase price for exacttarget was approximately 26 billion 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2014 for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2014 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and renewals we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting estimates—revenue recognition” below 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue we typically issue renewal invoices in 

  

index to financial statements advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings approximately 74 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2014 

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below 

 

 unbilled deferred revenue 

the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 45 billion as of january 31 2014 and approximately 35 billion as of january 31 2013 also as a result our typical contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels as we recognize revenue deferred revenue and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sellthrough to an end user customer 

  

index to financial statements cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future additionally as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 

we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters 

  

index to financial statements stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we acquire more companies as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

during fiscal 2014 we recognized stockbased expense of 5033 million as of january 31 2014 the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weightedaverage period of 19 years was 14 billion we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 5963 million during fiscal 2015 4259 million during fiscal 2016 2510 million during fiscal 2017 and 1002 million during fiscal 2018 the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2014 and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “summary of business and significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 

  

  

  

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

  

index to financial statements professional services and other revenues 

the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multipledeliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multipledeliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions premium support and professional services if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multipledeliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

multipledeliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments deferred revenue is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with 

  

index to financial statements our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2014 we deferred 2651 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 1946 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 2326 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 1548 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 3249 million at january 31 2014 and 2544 million at january 31 2013 

goodwill and longlived assets  we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected customer retention rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as but not limited to a substantial decline in our market capitalization an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and unanticipated competition 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization we evaluate longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset a longlived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if a longlived asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

stockbased options and awards we recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan “espp” the fair value of each option or espp share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change inputs into the blackscholes option pricing model include 

 

  

  

  

 income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date at each of the interim financial reporting periods we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period the estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many 

  

index to financial statements factors including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans andor tax planning strategies should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them changes in tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the united states and many countries in the european union changes in accounting principles adverse results of tax examinations as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stockbased compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders’ equity 

strategic investments  we report our investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privatelyheld companies at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an otherthantemporary decline in value has occurred management evaluates financial results earnings trends technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of otherthantemporary impairment

index to financial statements revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 11712 million or 29 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 9265 million or 30 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 2447 million or 26 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates however the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies caused a decrease in us dollar revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period a year ago the foreign currency impact had the effect of decreasing our aggregate revenues by 244 million compared to the same period a year ago 

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of revenues was 9684 million or 24 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 6836 million or 22 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 2848 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 1028 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 489 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity an increase of 804 million in depreciation and amortization expenses 321 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology an increase of 161 million in subcontractor and professional services expense an increase of 231 million in allocated overhead and an increase of 119 million in stockbased expenses we have increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since january 31 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers of which the majority was due to the acquisition of exacttarget in june 2013 we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years a portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above we expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity additionally the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies we also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses were 6238 million or 15 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 4295 million or 14 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1943 million the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of 1149 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 311 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 160 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 172 million in allocated overhead and an increase of 148 million in test data lab costs we increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since january 31 2013 in 

  

index to financial statements order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies the majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of exacttarget in june 2013 we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years a portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above we expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses were 22 billion or 53 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 16 billion or 53 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 5541 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 3571 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 593 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 572 million in advertising marketing and event costs and an increase of 498 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since january 31 2013 the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of exacttarget

 general and administrative expenses were 5967 million or 15 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 4338 million or 15 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1629 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 706 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 217 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 483 million in professional and outside services which included transaction fees associated with the exacttarget acquisition and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since january 31 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth the majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of exacttarget

index to financial statements investment income 

 

 investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 102 million for fiscal 2014 and was 196 million during the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities balances 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes term loan and capital leases interest expense net of interest costs capitalized was 772 million for fiscal 2014 and was 309 million during the same period a year ago the increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the march 2013 issuance of 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes the 3000 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of exacttarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in june 2013 

benefit from provision for income taxes 

 

 we reported a tax benefit of 1258 million with a pretax loss of 3579 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014 due to the exacttarget acquisition a deferred tax liability was established for the booktax basis difference related to purchased intangibles the net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in the previous year and recorded a tax benefit of 1431 million for fiscal 2014 

we recorded a tax provision of 1427 million on a pretax loss of 1278 million which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of 1868 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 

we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in our evaluation we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence during fiscal 2013 we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a 

  

index to financial statements valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of 1868 million we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly due to the valuation allowance the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods see note 8 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes

investment income 

 

 investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 196 million during fiscal 2013 and was 233 million during fiscal 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to fiscal 2012 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases interest expense net of interest costs capitalized was 309 million during fiscal 2013 and was 170 million during fiscal 2012 during fiscal 2013 we capitalized 24 million of interest costs related to capital projects capitalized interest during fiscal 2012 was 146 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we suspended preconstruction activity which includes capitalized interest costs on the undeveloped real estate in san francisco california resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2012 

benefit from provision for income taxes 

 

 we recorded a tax provision of 1427 million during fiscal 2013 which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent the effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of 1868 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets

we recorded a tax benefit of 217 million during fiscal 2012 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent the effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and california tax credits and the impact of the radian6 acquisition the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and nondeductible amounts the effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pretax loss 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2014 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 13 billion and accounts receivable of 14 billion 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8755 million during fiscal 2014 and 7369 million during the same period a year ago cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stockbased awards the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows and changes in working capital accounts 

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheet the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 increased 1386 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation during fiscal 2014 81 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was reclassified to cash flows from financing activities as compared to 149 million during the same period a year ago the increase in net cash in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital accounts primarily an increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in accounts payable accrued expenses 

  

index to financial statements and other liabilities net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by approximately 300 million of payments made for the transaction fees incurred by exacttarget and us related to the acquisition 

net cash used in investing activities was 24 billion during fiscal 2014 and 9389 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 primarily related to the acquisition of edgespring inc “edgespring” in june 2013 the acquisition of exacttarget in july 2013 capital expenditures including new office buildouts and a new intellectual property licensing agreement investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 16 billion during fiscal 2014 and 3345 million during the same period a year ago net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of 11 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes 848 million from proceeds from the issuance of warrants 2985 million of proceeds from the term loan net of loan fees and 2899 million from proceeds from employeerelated equity plans offset by 1538 million for the purchase of hedges on the convertible note 411 million of principal payments on capital leases and 150 million of principal payments on the term loan 

in july 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with bank of america na and certain other lenders which provides for a 3000 million term loan the “term loan” that matures on july 11 2016 the “maturity date” the term loan bears interest at our option under either a liborbased formula or a base rate formula each as set forth in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness issue preferred stock or pay dividends and certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the credit agreement we were in compliance with the credit agreement’s covenants as of january 31 2014 

the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 20 for fiscal 2014 as of january 31 2014 the amount outstanding under the term loan was 2850 million accrued interest on the term loan was 05 million as of january 31 2014 during fiscal 2014 payments totaling 150 million were made on the term loan and subsequent payments of 75 million are due quarterly thereafter until the maturity date in july 2016 when the remaining outstanding principal amount is due 

in january 2010 we issued 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due january 15 2015 the “075 senior notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “075 note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “075 warrants” the 075 senior notes will mature on january 15 2015 unless earlier converted upon conversion of any 075 senior notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 075 senior notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 075 senior notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both 

for the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended october 31 2013 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 2134 per share applicable to the 075 senior notes accordingly the 075 senior notes were convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending january 31 2014 for the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2014 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 2134 per share applicable to the 075 senior notes accordingly the 075 senior notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2014 as the 075 senior notes are due on january 15 2015 they are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2014 

during the quarter ending april 30 2014 we will repay in cash an aggregate principal balance of at least 2800 million related to conversion requests of our 075 senior notes received through the date of the filing of 

  

index to financial statements this form 10k the excess of the conversion value that is greater than the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock for the majority of the conversion requests received to date if our stock price continues to exceed the conversion price of our 075 senior notes we may continue to see conversion requests on the 075 senior notes during fiscal 2015 

in march 2013 we issued 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes due april 1 2018 the “025 senior notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “025 note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “025 warrants” the 025 senior notes will mature on april 1 2018 unless earlier converted upon conversion of any 025 senior notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 025 senior notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 025 senior notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both 

the 025 senior notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter commencing after april 30 2013 our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 6644 per share applicable to the 025 senior notes the 025 senior notes have not yet been convertible at the holders’ option the 025 senior notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2014 for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2014 our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 6644 per share applicable to the 025 senior notes accordingly the 025 senior notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2014 and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations us treasury securities us agency obligations government obligations collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities time deposits money market mutual funds and municipal securities 

as of january 31 2014 we have a total of 554 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and expire at various dates through december 2030 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center and computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures at january 31 2014 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

   

  

index to financial statements the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations the financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445000 rentable square feet of office space in san francisco california as of january 31 2014 402 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation building in progress—leased facility which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

during fiscal 2014 and in future fiscal years we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity we plan to upgrade andor replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation sk item 10e “use of nongaap financial measures in commission filings” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information our measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure 

nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income 

we use the nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding noncash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in addition to our gaap measures we use these nongaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating our performance we believe that these nongaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude certain expenses and benefits these items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but are made for our longterm benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 

we define nongaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses in each case for the reasons set forth below we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain noncash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these noncash items on our gross margin and operating performance additionally as significant unusual or discrete events occur the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

 we define nongaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues 

we define nongaap operating profit as our nongaap gross profit less operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses 

nongaap earnings per share 

management uses the nongaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 

we define nongaap earnings per share as our nongaap net income which excludes the above components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 

limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures 

a limitation of our nongaap financial measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies including peer companies and therefore comparability may be limited thus our nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap 

  

index to financial statements operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with gaap additionally in the case of stockbased expense if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stockbased expense the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 

we compensate for these limitations by reconciling nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure we encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our nongaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 

our reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures of gross profit operating profit net income and earnings per share to the most comparable gaap measure “gross profit” “loss from operations” “net loss” and “net loss per share” for the years ended january 31 2014 2013 and 2012 are as follows in thousands except for share numbers 

 

   

index to financial statements   

 the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earningsloss per share for the years ended january 31 2014 2013 and 2012 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been antidilutive the following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the gaap earningsloss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the nongaap diluted earnings per share

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 13 billion at january 31 2014 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least triple bbb or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2014 could result in a 88 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 18 billion the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 167 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in january 2010 we issued at par value 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due 2015 the “075 senior notes” and in march 2013 we issued at par value 115 billion of 025 convertible senior notes the “025 senior notes” collectively the “notes” holders may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes amounts in excess of the principal amounts of the notes if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

the 075 senior notes and the 025 senior notes have fixed annual interest rates of 075 and 025 respectively and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of 

  

index to financial statements the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair values of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair values of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our 075 senior notes was 5422 million and the carrying value of our 025 senior notes was 10 billion as of january 31 2014 which represents the liability components of the 5689 million principal balance and 115 billion principal balance respectively the total estimated fair values of our 075 senior notes and 025 senior notes at january 31 2014 were 16 billion and 13 billion respectively the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the 075 senior notes and 025 senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 which were 28378 and 11529 respectively 

in july 2013 we entered into a 3000 million term loan the “term loan” which matures in july 2016 and bears interest at our option of either a base rate plus a spread of 050 to 100 or an adjusted libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a spread of 150 to 200 the company entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of exacttarget interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest as described above at the end of an interest period the term loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to 75 million beginning in september 2013 with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity 

by entering into the term loan we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 20 for fiscal 2014 changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privatelyheld companies many of which are in the development stage when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities of the privatelyheld companies using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting as of january 31 2014 and january 31 2013 the fair value of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 770 million and 468 million respectively

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2014 based on the 1992 framework established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of exacttarget inc exacttarget which we acquired july 12 2013 as discussed in note 4 “business combinations” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of exacttarget in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenues subject to exacttarget’s internal control over financial reporting represented less than five percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2014 total assets and net assets subject to exacttarget’s internal control over financial reporting represented less than four percent and less than six percent respectively of our consolidated total assets and consolidated net assets excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of january 31 2014 

  

index to financial statements based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2014 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2014 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2014 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we were incorporated in delaware in february 1999 our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 94105 

the cloud social and mobile revolution 

we believe that the convergence of cloud social and mobile technologies is fundamentally transforming how companies connect with their customers employees partners and products 

cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps instead companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an internet browser or mobile device on an asneeded basis without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software inhouse 

the broad shift to social networking and the use of location aware touchbased mobile devices in our personal lives have introduced new ways to communicate and collaborate people now expect to have social and mobile experiences in their professional lives – they want to communicate through “feeds” and status updates from their phone or tablet rather than being tethered to a desktop by their business applications with customers partners and employees connected and empowered we believe companies must transform the way they sell service market and innovate 

our cloud solutions 

we provide enterprise cloud computing solutions we offer social and mobile cloud apps and platform services as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solutions we provide solutions in each of our four core markets sales customer service marketing and cloud platforms 

our primary service offerings are as follows 

sales cloud the sales cloud enables companies to grow their sales pipelines close more deals improve sales productivity and gain valuable business insights our customers use the sales cloud to access accurate customer and prospect information track leads and progress forecast opportunities and collaborate around closing a sale on any device the sales cloud also encompasses partner relationship management functionality including channel management and partner portals and realtime customer and contact information 

service cloud the service cloud enables companies to connect with their customers and effectively address their service and support needs our customers use the service cloud to connect their customer service agents with customers across every channel phone email chat selfservice web portals social networks and online communities in addition builtin collaboration tools enable customer service teams to share information on how to better service customers 

marketing cloud our customers use the marketing cloud to listen to conversations taking place on public social networks like facebook twitter and blogs they can also publish content to engage with customers across these social networks as well as to their own websites the marketing cloud provides sophisticated analytics that enable companies to better identify sales leads and customer service issues discover advocates rapidly identify brand product or support issues and analyze content across social networks relevant conversations can be routed into the sales cloud and service cloud in the form of leads contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers 

the salesforce platform the salesforce platform provides the infrastructure and many of the services that application developers need to build and deliver business apps the salesforce platform is delivered as a service enabling it departments and independent software vendors “isvs” to be more efficient dedicating their time to building apps rather than managing hardware and software with the salesforce platform developers have the freedom to develop apps in many of today’s most popular programming languages including java and ruby the salesforce platform makes any app social and mobile providing 

  

social networking features such as profiles status updates and feeds as well as the ability to extend apps to mobile devices 

professional services 

we offer consulting deployment and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our social and mobile cloud solutions most of our consulting and deployment engagements are billed on a time and materials basis we offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying using administering and developing on our service we also offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our service 

business benefits of using our solution 

the key advantages of our solution include 

secure private scalable and reliable  our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance reliability and security we have built and continue to invest in a comprehensive security infrastructure including firewalls intrusion detection systems and encryption for transmissions over the internet which we monitor and test on a regular basis we built and maintain a multitenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely reliably and costeffectively our multitenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously 

rapid deployment our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring installing or maintaining the servers storage networking equipment security products or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary 

ease of integration it professionals are able to integrate our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly we provide a set of application programming interfaces “apis” that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing thirdparty custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions for example many of our customers use our forcecom api to move customerrelated data from customdeveloped and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities 

high levels of user adoption we have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications as a result our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training 

rapid development of apps using the salesforce platform our customers and thirdparty developers can develop apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multitenant platform we provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices 

increased innovation by providing infrastructure and development environments on demand we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution a developer with an idea for a new app can log onto our platforms develop test and support their system on the salesforce platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to his or her customers 

lower total cost of ownership we enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract 

  

because we deploy all upgrades on our servers new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately 

our strategy 

our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell service market and innovate not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build apps 

key elements of our strategy include 

strengthening our marketleading core solutions we designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functions we intend to continue to extend our core solutions with new features and functions we also offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced crm capabilities through our own development acquisitions and partnerships we have strengthened and extended our sales cloud and service cloud application offerings we expect to continue to make such investments in the future 

innovating in highgrowth markets as part of our growth strategy we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories including marketing collaboration and human capital management we are expanding our footprint in these areas to offer new social and mobile cloud innovations to our customers 

improve renewal rates our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms we run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers 

deepening relationships with existing customers we see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers as our customers realize the benefits of our service we aim to either upgrade the customer to higher priced editions or sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and ultimately pursue enterprisewide deployments 

pursuing new customers aggressively we believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size as a result we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes primarily through our direct sales force we have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service 

building our business in top markets globally we also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service globally we plan to continue to aggressively market to customers worldwide by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in the largest enterprise software markets around the world 

encouraging the development of thirdparty apps on our cloud computing platforms the salesforce platform enables existing customers isvs and thirdparty developers to create and deliver cloud apps they have built on our multitenant platform it is a platform on which apps can be created tested published and run in addition these apps can be marketed and sold on the appexchange our online marketplace for business apps or sold directly by software vendors we believe our ecosystem of cloud developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers 

technology development and operations 

we deliver our service as a highly scalable multitenant app we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service we have optimized our service to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware operating system and 

  

database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment as part of our business strategy we periodically acquire companies or technologies and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our service while maintaining the quality and security standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications databases and other resources as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

because of our multitenant and logically separated architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a solution based on a single version of our apps 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology 

our customers access our service over the internet via all of the major internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems 

we provide our services to our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 

sources of revenue 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service we also derive revenues from premier support which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered 

amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors including new business seasonality within the year the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals varying billing cycles of subscription agreements invoice timing foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter 

  

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan the majority of our revenue from the americas is attributable to customers in the united states approximately 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

direct sales 

we sell our services primarily through our direct sales force which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads our small business commercial and enterprise account executives focus their efforts on small midsize and large enterprises respectively 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects 

this network includes global consulting firms systems integrators and regional partners in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer also included in this network are isvs whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals 

we continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web telephone email social networks and other channels we provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions we also offer premier customer support for an additional fee which includes services such as priority access to technical resources developer support andor system administration 

  

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology frequent introductions of new products and services and as we have seen recently consolidation many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering crm apps we also compete with internally developed apps and may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will become a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information 

employees 

as of january 31 2013 we had 9800 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located in the united states companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service 

  

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our it systems our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability these security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our it systems additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data or it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data because we do not control our customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing malicious thirdparties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation and hardware from a variety of vendors any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 36 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate andor harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the markets for our marketing cloud and salesforce platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be 

  

successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a data center contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 36 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for lower cost editions of our service we cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic 

  

conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs our business may suffer 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors and the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

we expect to incur net gaap losses in the future 

we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since july 31 2011 in addition we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our longterm benefit such as equity awards and business combinations additionally for the foreseeable future we must maintain a substantial valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset balance if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses on a us gaap basis in the future 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

as we acquire companies or technologies we may not realize the expected business benefits the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline 

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure research and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our service to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with the overall growth of our company 

we regularly upgrade andor replace our various software systems if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train 

  

and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business historically sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented over 30 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights and commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example we have received a notice from a large nonpracticing entity alleging that we infringe upon certain of its patents we continue to analyze the potential merits of such claim if any the potential defenses and counterclaims to such claim and we have been engaged in discussions with this entity with respect to these matters no litigation has been filed to date 

in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or licensing discussions or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

  

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of the internet crossborder data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the crossborder transfer of personal information the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data 

  

necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands 

we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforcecom brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers partners and employees our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products services and features in order to maintain and enhance our brands we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

any failure in our delivery of highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position 

we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco if we do not realize any benefits our financial performance may be negatively impacted 

in november 2010 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land we may not realize any benefits 

  

with respect to the purchase of such real estate during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we suspended preconstruction activity on the land if we commence efforts to develop the real estate we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility in the event that we decide to sell this property the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet and our financial results may be negatively impacted 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to capitalization matters 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

  

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of january 31 2013 our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing sales professional services and development occupy over 950000 square feet in the san francisco bay area we also lease space in various locations throughout the united states for local sales and professional services personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel 

we also own approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land 

we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements see note 10 “commitments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our lease commitments if we require additional space we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable commercially reasonable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights commercial corporate and securities labor and employment wage and hour and other claims we have been and may in the future be put on notice andor sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement for example we have received a notice from a large nonpracticing entity alleging that we infringe upon certain of its patents we continue to analyze the potential merits of such claim if any the potential defenses and counterclaims to such claim and we have been engaged in discussions with this entity with respect to these matters no litigation has been filed to date 

we evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counter claims settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any claims or litigation regardless of the merits is inherently uncertain any claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits whether through settlement or litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan result in efforts to enjoin our activities lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

  

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations estimated settlements legal rulings advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter in our opinion resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter

overview 

we are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions we were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management or crm applications via the internet or “cloud” we introduced our first crm solution in february 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions solutions and enhanced features through internal development and acquisitions we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the availability performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers 

  

encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity the hiring of additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities continuing to develop our brands the addition of distribution channels the upgrade of our service offerings the development of new services the integration of acquired technologies the expansion of our marketing cloud and salesforce platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 

we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry as a result of our aggressive growth plans specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a gaap basis as we continue with our growth plan we anticipate we will have net losses on a gaap basis for the next several quarters 

in november 2010 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land we have capitalized all preconstruction activities related to the development of the land including interest costs and property taxes since the november 2010 purchase during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we suspended preconstruction activity the total carrying value of the land building improvements and perpetual parking rights was 3211 million as of january 31 2013 we continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and our options for the undeveloped real estate 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2013 and 52 percent for fiscal 2012 to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers and build greater brand awareness 

on august 13 2012 we acquired the outstanding stock of buddy media inc “buddy” a social media marketing platform we acquired buddy for the assembled workforce expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating buddy’s social media marketing platform with our current offerings the financial results of buddy are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the total purchase price for buddy was 7358 million 

we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in making that assessment we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine based on the weight of available evidence whether it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in our evaluation we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence as of october 31 2013 and recorded a onetime noncash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in the amount of 1491 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets this accounting treatment has no effect on our actual ability to utilize deferred tax assets such as loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce future cash tax payments we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2013 for example refer to the fiscal year ending january 31 2013 

  

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2013 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and service renewal rates we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below prior to february 1 2011 the deliverables in multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items if the deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement a significant portion of our multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables additionally in these situations we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ” “asu 200913” which amended the previous multipledeliverable arrangements accounting guidance pursuant to the new guidance objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement separately instead arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis we applied the new accounting guidance to those multipledeliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february 1 2011 which was the beginning of our fiscal 2012 

  

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we introduced greater operational discipline around annual invoicing for both new business and renewals which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 marks the one year anniversary of this operational shift therefore the incremental benefit to deferred revenue from annual invoicing was lower than it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue we typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below 

 

 unbilled deferred revenue 

the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue was approximately 35 billion as of january 31 2013 and approximately 22 billion as of january 31 2012 due to our sales to large enterprise accounts we are experiencing longer contractual commitments by our customers which is reflected in our growing unbilled deferred revenue also as a result our average contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months this has a positive impact on our renewal rate we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero 

  

just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future additionally as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events the timing of these marketing events such as our annual and largest event dreamforce will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute 

  

dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

for fiscal 2013 we recognized stockbased expense of 3794 million as of january 31 2013 the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was 12 billion we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 4910 million during fiscal 2014 3942 million during fiscal 2015 2498 million during fiscal 2016 and 925 million during fiscal 2017 the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2013 and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 

  

  

  

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

  

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multipledeliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multipledeliverables that generally include subscription premium support and professional services 

prior to february 1 2011 the deliverables in multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items if the deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement a significant portion of our multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables additionally in these situations we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized 

in october 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ” “asu 200913” which amended the previous multipledeliverable arrangements accounting guidance pursuant to the updated guidance objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement separately instead arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis we have applied the updated accounting guidance to those multipledeliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february 1 2011 which was the beginning of fiscal 2012 

the adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended january 31 2012 as of january 31 2013 the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are 93 million and approximately 39 million respectively which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period 

under the updated accounting guidance in order to treat deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the 

  

services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multipledeliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

under the updated accounting guidance when multipledeliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments deferred revenue is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 

as a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to february 1 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 36 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

  

during fiscal 2013 we deferred 2326 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 1548 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 1672 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 1072 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 2544 million at january 31 2013 and 1766 million at january 31 2012 

goodwill and longlived assets  we make estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of acquired companies critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected customer retention rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as but not limited to a substantial decline in our market capitalization an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and unanticipated competition 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization we evaluate longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset a longlived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if a longlived asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 

strategic investments  we report our investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privatelyheld companies at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an otherthantemporary decline in value has occurred management evaluates financial results earnings trends technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of otherthantemporary impairment 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

   

  

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

stockbased options and awards we recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan “espp” the fair value of each option or award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates inputs into the blackscholes option pricing model include 

 

  

  

 income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 

we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in making that assessment we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine based on the weight of available evidence whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses forecasted income or losses the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 

our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and accounting principles as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stockbased compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders’ equity

the following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 

 

  

   

  

 fiscal years ended january 31 2013 and 2012 

revenues 

 

 total revenues were 31 billion for fiscal 2013 compared to 23 billion during the same period a year ago an increase of 7837 million or 35 percent subscription and support revenues were 29 billion or 94 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013 compared to 21 billion or 94 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago during fiscal 2013 we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption have helped improve our renewal rates the price per user per month for our three primary offerings professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods professional services and other revenues were 1814 million or six percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013 compared to 1403 million or six percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 9265 million or 30 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013 compared to 7263 million or 32 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 2002 million or 28 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above revenues outside of the americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar relative to major international currencies which reduced aggregate international revenues by 439 million compared to the same period a year ago 

  

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of revenues was 6836 million or 22 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013 compared to 4889 million or 22 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1947 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 775 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 163 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 362 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of 375 million in depreciation and amortization expenses 172 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of 146 million in allocated overhead we have increased our headcount by 32 percent since january 31 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity additionally the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies we also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses were 4295 million or 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013 compared to 2953 million or 13 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1341 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 926 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 304 million in stockbased expenses and an increase of 88 million in our development and test data center we increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since january 31 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2014 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new and improve existing technologies and the integration of acquired technologies 

  

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses were 16 billion or 53 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2013 compared to 12 billion or 52 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 4444 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of 3059 million in employeerelated costs including amortization of deferred commissions 836 million in stockbased expenses 293 million in advertising marketing and event costs and 237 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since january 31 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses were 4338 million or 15 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2013 compared to 3478 million or 15 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 860 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 562 million in employeerelated costs and an increase of 198 million in stockbased expenses our general and administrative headcount increased by 15 percent since january 31 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth 

loss from operations 

 

 loss from operations during fiscal 2013 was 1107 million and included 3794 million of stockbased expenses and 882 million of amortization of purchased intangibles during the same period a year ago loss from operations was 351 million and included 2293 million of stockbased expenses and 673 million of amortization of purchased intangibles 

investment income 

 

   

investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 196 million during fiscal 2013 and was 233 million during the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to the same period a year ago 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases interest expense net of interest costs capitalized was 309 million during fiscal 2013 and was 170 million during the same period a year ago during fiscal 2013 we capitalized 24 million of interest costs related to capital projects capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was 146 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we suspended preconstruction activity which includes capitalized interest costs on the undeveloped real estate in san francisco california resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to the same period a year ago 

benefit from provision for income taxes 

 

 we recorded a tax provision of 1427 million during fiscal 2013 which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent the effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of 1868 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 

we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in our evaluation we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence during fiscal 2013 we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of 1868 million we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly due to the valuation allowance the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods see note 8 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we recorded a tax benefit of 217 million during fiscal 2012 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent the effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and california tax credits and the impact of the radian6 acquisition the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and nondeductible amounts the effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pretax loss 

  

we also receive certain tax incentives in switzerland and singapore in the form of reduced tax rates these temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014 respectively the singapore program however is eligible for renewal

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 7263 million or 32 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2012 compared to 5221 million or 32 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 an increase of 2041 million or 39 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates additionally the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in us dollar revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by 369 million compared to fiscal 2011 

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of revenues was 4889 million or 22 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2012 compared to 3238 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 an increase of 1651 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 204 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 53 million in stock based expenses an increase of 398 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of 683 million in depreciation and amortization expenses 446 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets an increase of 242 million in 

  

outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 55 million in allocated overhead gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved during fiscal 2012 primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multipledeliverable arrangements 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses were 2953 million or 13 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2012 compared to 1879 million or 11 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 an increase of 1075 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 667 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 270 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 22 million in our development and test data center an increase of 14 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of 86 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent in fiscal 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses were 11696 million or 52 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2012 compared to 7920 million or 48 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 an increase of 3776 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of 2556 million in employeerelated costs 593 million in stockbased expenses 225 million in advertising marketing and event costs 218 million in allocated overhead 82 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs 31 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the california wage and hour case our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent in fiscal 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses were 3478 million or 15 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2012 compared to 2559 million or 15 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 an increase of 919 million the increase was primarily due to increases of 575 million in employeerelated costs 173 million in stockbased expenses and 143 million in professional and outside service costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 46 percent in fiscal 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth

investment income 

 

 investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances investment income was 233 million during fiscal 2012 and was 377 million during fiscal 2011 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in realized gains from sales of marketable securities the decrease in marketable securities balances and lower interest rates 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases interest expense was 170 million net of interest costs capitalized during fiscal 2012 and was 249 million during fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2012 we capitalized 146 million of interest costs related to capital projects specifically costs related to our real estate holdings which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and our capitalized internaluse software development costs capitalized interest during fiscal 2011 was 40 million 

other expense 

 

 other expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses resulting from strategic investment activity and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of 29 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privatelyheld companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

  

benefit from provision for income taxes 

 

 the benefit for income taxes was 217 million during fiscal 2012 compared to an income tax provision of 346 million during fiscal 2011 

our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 the higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and california tax credits and a tax benefit related to the may 2011 acquisition of radian6 the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in the foreign tax rate differential foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pretax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pretax income the combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate 

the lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items first california enacted several income tax law changes which generally benefited californiabased companies the result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate second the company was subject to minimum state taxes which reduced the state tax benefit the combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of 22 million in fiscal 2011 to revalue the anticipated future tax effects of our california temporary differences related to this tax law change 

we also receive certain tax incentives in switzerland and singapore in the form of reduced tax rates these temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014 respectively the singapore program however is eligible for renewal 

new accounting pronouncement 

in july 2012 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201202 intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350—testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  asu 201202 to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment asu 201202 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value otherwise the quantitative impairment test is not required we plan to adopt asu 201202 in fiscal 2014 and do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2013 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 18 billion and accounts receivable of 8726 million 

net cash provided by operating activities was 7369 million during fiscal 2013 and 5915 million during the same period a year ago cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stockbased awards the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments the timing of collections from our customers which is our largest source of operating cash flows and changes in working capital accounts 

  

our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets claims against working capital include accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings 

as described above in “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings additionally due to continually increased annual cycle billing patterns the value of customer billings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to a higher accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of january 31 2013 than as of january 31 2012 

we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments we typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which is reflected on the balance sheet the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers 

in fiscal 2013 net cash provided by operating activities increased 1454 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and changes in working capital accounts which include the establishment of the tax valuation allowance during the year 

net cash used in investing activities was 9389 million during fiscal 2013 and 4897 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 primarily related to the purchase of rypple inc “rypple” in february 2012 the purchase of buddy in august 2012 the purchase of goinstant inc “goinstant” in september 2012 capital expenditures investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 3345 million during fiscal 2013 and 759 million during the same period a year ago net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of 3514 million of proceeds from equity plans and 149 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans offset by 318 million of principal payments on capital leases 

in january 2010 we issued 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due january 15 2015 the “notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “warrants” the notes will mature on january 15 2015 unless earlier converted upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both to date there has been a nominal amount of conversions 

for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended october 31 2012 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes were convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending january 31 2013 the notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2013 for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2013 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes will be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations us treasury securities us agency obligations government obligations collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities time deposits money market mutual funds and municipal securities 

as of january 31 2013 we have a total of 608 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through december 2030 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures at january 31 2013 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands 

 

 the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

during fiscal 2014 and future fiscal years we expect to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity we plan to upgrade andor replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company additionally we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 as a result of continued office buildouts other leasehold improvements and data center investments 

in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

  

nongaap financial measures 

regulation sk item 10e “use of nongaap financial measures in commission filings” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information our measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure 

nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income 

we use the nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding noncash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in addition to our gaap measures we use these nongaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating our performance we believe that these nongaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude certain expenses these certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but are made for our longterm benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 

we define nongaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses in each case for the reasons set forth below we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain noncash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these noncash items on our gross margin and operating performance additionally as significant unusual or discrete events occur the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 we define nongaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues 

we define nongaap operating profit as our nongaap gross profit less operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses 

nongaap earnings per share 

management uses the nongaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 

we define nongaap earnings per share as our nongaap net income which excludes the above components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 

limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures 

a limitation of our nongaap financial measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies including peer companies and therefore comparability may be limited thus our nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with gaap additionally in the case of stockbased expense if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stockbased expense the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 

we compensate for these limitations by reconciling nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure we encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our nongaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 

  

  

our reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure of gross profit operating profit net income and earnings per share to the most comparable gaap measure “gross profit” “income loss from operations” “net income loss” and “diluted earnings loss per share” for the years ended january 31 2013 2012 and 2011 are as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earningsloss per share for the year ended january 31 2013 because we had a net loss for the period and the effect would have been antidilutive the following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the gaap earningsloss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the nongaap diluted earnings per share

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 18 billion at january 31 2013 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2013 could result in a 167 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

  

at january 31 2012 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 14 billion the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 121 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in january 2010 we issued at par value 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due 2015 the “notes” holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

for the three months ended january 31 2013 the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2013 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes will be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 

the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 075 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our notes was 5213 million as of january 31 2013 this represents the liability component of the 5750 million principal balance as of january 31 2013 the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31 2013 was 11785 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 which was 20500 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privatelyheld companies many of which are in the development stage when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities of the privatelyheld companies using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting as of january 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of these investments in privatelyheld companies was 468 million and 483 million respectively

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2013 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2013 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2013 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2013 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we were incorporated in delaware in february 1999 and founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management or “crm” applications via the internet or “cloud” cloud computing refers to the use of internetbased computing storage and connectivity technology to deliver a variety of different services we introduced our first crm service in february 2000 since then primarily through development and to a lesser extent acquisition we have augmented our crm service with new editions services and enhanced features in recent years we have seen a broad shift in the information technology “it” industry to social networking and the use of mobile devices industry analysts describe how social networking users have surpassed the total number of email users how consumers are spending the majority of their time on the internet using social websites and how more people are browsing the internet on mobile devices than on desktop computers in fiscal 2012 to address this shift to social networking we began to describe to companies of all sizes the benefits of becoming a social enterprise and how our service offerings could accelerate their transformation into becoming a social enterprise 

  

we have designed developed and acquired applications and platforms that are easytouse and intuitive that can be deployed rapidly customized easily and integrated with other enterprise applications or platforms we deliver our service through all of the marketleading internet browsers and mobile devices customers who use our social enterprise applications and platforms are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations as a result our customers face less risk and lower upfront implementation and ongoing costs and benefit from increased productivity and efficiency 

we market our social enterprise applications and platforms to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and to a lesser extent indirectly through partners through our platforms and other developer tools we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications that run on our platforms but which are sold separately from or in conjunction with our social enterprise solution 

our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom  our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 94105 

cloud computing 

cloud computing changes the way enterprise business applications are developed and deployed application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers storage network devices operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application instead the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management and developers simply use an internet browser to access the development environment application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an internet browser or mobile device on an asneeded basis and are able to take advantage of a robust secure scalable and highly available application with few or no implementation services required and without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software infrastructure inhouse 

historically only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning and sales marketing and service applications to gain an enterprisewide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes today cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries because third parties manage the infrastructure our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multitenant technology architecture which enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of an application periodic upgrades more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure 

in recent years we have seen a shift from traditional enterprise software to enterprise cloud computing we believe this shift to cloud computing provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multitenant infrastructure businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software as a result we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

we believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing however enterprise cloud computing also includes building new applications on a cloudbased application development platform also referred to as cloud platforms 

application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers application developers include corporate it departments that typically develop applications for a company’s internaluse and independent software vendors “isvs” that develop applications to sell to customers traditionally these developers have needed to purchase install test 

  

and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications this requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to develop applications with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels 

cloud platforms enable corporate it developers and isvs to leverage the benefits of a multitenant platform for developing new applications cloud platforms allow developers to build applications using only a browser and an internet connection just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser in addition developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment 

the social enterprise 

we believe that the next phase of cloud computing is again transforming enterprise software driven by the consumerization of it the next phase of cloud computing will have three key characteristics – it will be social mobile and open with the popularity of social networking websites new ways to communicate and collaborate based on feeds and status updates have emerged in the enterprise market that means enabling employees customers and partners to easily find share and collaborate around information and business processes in addition with the wide adoption of mobile phones and tablets customers now expect cloud computing technologies to work on these devices fully leveraging functionality such as touchscreens regardless of the carrier or operating system customers are increasingly focused on open standards which enable developers to easily integrate our solution with applications and technology from other vendors and we offer a web services application programming interface “api” for programmatic access and integration we call this the social enterprise and we help our customers embrace the opportunities and meet the challenges it poses to businesses we believe that companies must change the way they collaborate communicate and share information with customers employees and partners to stay competitive 

our solution helps companies transform themselves into social enterprises by 

 

  

  

  

   

 our solution is comprised of cloud applications and cloud platforms as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solution 

our cloud applications for the social enterprise 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises with our applications our primary applications are within our sales cloud and service cloud brands but the combination of all the applications below allows our customers to transform themselves by connecting engaging selling servicing and collaborating with customers as well as improving internal automation and collaboration our primary applications are as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 our cloud platforms for the social enterprise 

our cloud platforms provide application developers access to new capabilities that can be built into their business applications these platforms include features popularized by social networking companies such as profiles status updates and feeds and also the capability to extend applications for use on mobile devices in addition they run on our databasecom offering an open enterprise database built for social and mobile computing 

our cloud platforms allow both it departments and isv developers to use several programming languages to build their applications developers are able to use the most popular programming languages on our cloud platforms such as java and ruby to build their applications and our cloud platforms support multiple other languages to provide developers openness and choice 

we have two platform offerings forcecom and heroku and offer additional developer tools such as databasecom and the appexchange the details of these offerings are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

professional services 

we offer consulting deployment and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our social enterprise services we expanded our ability to provide these services to our customers in our acquisition of model metrics in december 2011 consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service deployment services include systems integration technical architecture and development configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers most of our consulting and deployment engagements are billed on a time and materials basis we offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying using administering and developing on our service we also offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our service 

as the reach of our enterprise cloud computing services has grown partners and other thirdparty consulting and professional service providers play an integral part in providing these services to our customers 

business benefits of using our solution 

the key advantages of our solution include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 our gotomarket strategy 

our objective is to help companies put customers and employees at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by the use of our applications and platforms not only do we want to be the leading provider of the social enterprise solution we also want to offer additional social applications and have the leading cloud computing platforms upon which our customers and partners build applications 

key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 technology development and operations 

we deliver our service as a highly scalable multitenant application we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service we have optimized our services to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications databases and other resources as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

because of our multitenant and logically separated architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our applications we are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our applications 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology 

our customers access our service over the internet through supported internet browsers and mobile devices 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

sources of revenue 

we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees from our customers and support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee 

  

  

we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including the americas europe and asia pacific which includes japan over 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the americas 

direct sales 

we sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone and field sales personnel that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads our small business general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small mediumsize and large enterprises respectively 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects 

the network includes consulting firms other technology vendors systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer we expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract 

we also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquires from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by the web telephone and email 

basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying editions premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services such as an assigned support representative andor administrator premier customer support is available for a separate fee or is included in our unlimited edition additional support services include developer support and partner support 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for our offerings is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology frequent introductions of new products and services and as we have seen recently consolidation many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering cloud computing crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will be a greater competitive threat 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information 

employees 

as of january 31 2012 we had 7785 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and thirdparty software our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses as a result customers could elect to not renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located in the united states companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our it systems our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability these security 

  

measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our it systems additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data or it systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize thirdparty technology providers on our appexchange directory to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation negatively impact our future sales disrupt our business and lead to legal liability 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter any such decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate andor harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the market for our forcecom cloud computing platform remains relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with a datacenter contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 24 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for lower cost editions of our service we cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers’ spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs our business may suffer 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted 

  

by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate for example our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors and the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise cloud computing applications and platform services is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have 

  

established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

as we acquire companies or technologies they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline 

  

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure research and development and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our service to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with the overall growth of our company 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our 

  

services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 32 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31 2012 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

  

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights 

we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities these may include claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of thirdparty patents and other intellectual property rights and commercial labor and employment wage and hour and other matters 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any litigation regardless of its merits is inherently uncertain any claims and lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both 

in addition our exposure to risks associated with various claims including the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies for example we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense any of our patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

  

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of the internet crossborder data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the crossborder transfer of personal information the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

if we fail to develop and maintain our brands our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expense to build our brands brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

  

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco if we do not realize any benefits our financial performance may be negatively impacted 

in november 2010 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land we may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate we have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase and if we develop the real estate will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility finally real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets in the event that we cease development of the real estate in the future or have a future need to sell this property we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all and our financial results may be negatively impacted 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to capitalization matters 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors

we have been and may in the future be put on notice andor sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights including patent infringement we evaluate these claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits our potential defenses and counter claims and the expected effect on us our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 

the outcome of any litigation regardless of its merits is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims and other lawsuits and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert our attention from executing our business plan lead to attempts on the part of other parties to seek similar claims and in the case of intellectual property claims require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

in general the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

we make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises social enterprises leverage social mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our enterprise customer relationship management “crm” application service in february 2000 since then we have augmented our crm service with new editions services and enhanced features over the last few years we have both developed and acquired several mobile social and open technologies to help our customers become social enterprises we introduced our forcecom platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm we launched our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications and services that are integrated with our flagship crm product and in most cases have been developed on our forcecom platform by third parties we introduced chatter a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in realtime recently we enabled companies to invite their customers to collaborate with chatter in private groups on this corporate social network our salesforce datacom “datacom” offering which provides some contacts from jigsaw data corporation “jigsaw” provides the most complete source of accurate business data and seamlessly integrates with our crm products we also expanded our platform offering via the acquisition of heroku inc “heroku” an application development platform and the launch of databasecom the world’s first enterprise cloud database we acquired radian6 technologies inc “radian6” to help companies monitor and engage with their customers via social media 

our objective is to help companies put customers at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by leveraging our applications and platforms key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services the performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of 

  

additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our platforms our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity we also plan to continue to hire additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development as part of our growth plans we intend to continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal 

additionally we plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities continue to develop our brands add additional distribution channels increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future as such we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2013 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry 

during fiscal 2012 we acquired several businesses and technologies to strengthen and extend our service offerings in may 2011 we acquired radian6 for a total purchase consideration of approximately 3366 million net of cash acquired radian6 is a cloud application vendor that provides customers with social media monitoring measurement and engagement solutions we acquired radian6 for its developed technology assembled workforce expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating radian6’s social solution technology with our current product offerings in september 2011 we acquired assistly for a total purchase consideration of approximately 587 million assistly is a cloudbased provider of customer service solutions we acquired assistly for its developed help desk application technology in order to expand our customer service market opportunities in the small and emerging business market in order to expand our mobile and social consulting services in december 2011 we acquired model metrics a cloud computing professional services company for a total purchase consideration of approximately 667 million 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 52 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2012 and 48 percent for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers and build greater brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2012 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2012 

  

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from 1 subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services 2 support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees 3 professional services which include consulting services such as process mapping and project management and implementation services including systems integration technical architecture and development and data conversion and 4 other revenue which consists primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2012 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers varying service types the price of our service and service renewal rates we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of training classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates – revenue recognition” below prior to february 1 2011 the deliverables in multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items if the deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement a significant portion of our multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables additionally in these situations we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ” “asu 200913” which amended the previous multipledeliverable arrangements accounting guidance pursuant to the new guidance objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement separately instead arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis we applied the new accounting guidance to those multipledeliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february 1 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year 

  

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns currently there is greater operational discipline around annual invoicing for both new business and renewals occasionally we bill customers for their multiyear contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below 

 

 unbilled deferred revenue 

the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue was over 22 billion as of january 31 2012 and over 15 billion as of january 31 2011 unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services for example we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future additionally as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to equity plans for employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our stockbased compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

  

amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services such as process mapping project management implementation services and other revenue “other revenue” consists primarily of training fees 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied 

 

  

  

  

 our subscription service arrangements are noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

subscription and support revenues 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date our service is made available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

professional services and other revenues 

the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting as discussed below these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

multipledeliverable arrangements 

we enter into arrangements with multipledeliverables that generally include subscription premium support and professional services 

  

prior to february 1 2011 the deliverables in multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items if the deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement a significant portion of our multipledeliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables additionally in these situations we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized 

in october 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ” “asu 200913” which amended the previous multipledeliverable arrangements accounting guidance pursuant to the updated guidance objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement separately instead arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis we have applied the new accounting guidance to those multipledeliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february 1 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year 

the adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of january 31 2012 the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are 305 million and 143 million respectively which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period 

under the updated accounting guidance in order to treat deliverables in a multipledeliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work to date we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multipledeliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 

under the updated accounting guidance when multipledeliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if vsoe is not available we have determined that thirdparty evidence “tpe” is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant thirdparty pricing information the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue if any 

for certain professional services we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency the introduction of new services and other factors accordingly we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 

we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices the size and volume of our transactions the customer demographic the geographic area where our services are sold our price lists our 

  

gotomarket strategy historical standalone sales and contract prices the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management taking into consideration the gotomarket strategy as our gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in relative selling prices including both vsoe and besp 

deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments deferred revenue is influenced by several factors including seasonality the compounding effects of renewals invoice duration invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 

as a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to february 1 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term 

deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 

deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2012 we deferred 1672 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 1072 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 1212 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 802 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 1766 million at january 31 2012 and 1166 million at january 31 2011 

business combinations we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

stockbased awards we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of generally four years or one year for the employee stock purchase plan “espp” the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated life for the stock options is based on an actual analysis of expected life the estimated life for the espp is based on the two purchase periods within the offering period the risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a us government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights 

we estimate the future stock price volatility considering both our observed optionimplied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations we believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights 

we recognized stockbased expense of 2293 million during fiscal 2012 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2012 we had an aggregate of 8206 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 2965 million during fiscal 2013 2564 million during fiscal 2014 1961 million during fiscal 2015 and 716 million during fiscal 2016 these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2012 and assume no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees in future periods which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods 

we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs as applicable by jurisdiction when stock options are exercised the impact of stockbased expense in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates additionally we are required to use an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stockbased awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 

as of january 31 2012 there were 50 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding we plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future the restricted stock which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock has an exercise price of 0001 per share which is equal to the par value of our common stock and vests over four years the fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant and compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions compensation the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits the tax benefit recognized is 

  

measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 

strategic investments  we report our investments in marketable equity securities at fair market value using the quoted prices in their respective active markets we report our investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privatelyheld companies at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an otherthantemporary decline in value has occurred management evaluates financial results earnings trends technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of otherthan temporary impairment

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of revenues was 4889 million or 22 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2012 compared to 3238 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1651 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 204 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 53 million in stock based expenses an increase of 398 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity an increase of 683 million in depreciation and amortization expenses 446 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets an increase of 242 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 55 million in allocated overhead gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved over the same period a year ago primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multipledeliverable arrangements 

  

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity additionally the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies we also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods

our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for the same period a year ago the higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and california tax credits and a tax benefit related to the may 2011 acquisition of radian6 the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in foreign tax rate differential foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pretax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pretax income the combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate 

the lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items first california enacted several income tax law changes which generally benefited californiabased companies the result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate second the company was subject to minimum state taxes which reduced the state tax benefit the combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of 22 million in fiscal 2011 to revalue the anticipated future tax effects of our california temporary differences related to this tax law change

our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 the decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the us statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits the extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the tax relief act of 2010 the total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stockbased compensation was 441 million for fiscal 2011 see note 6 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes

new accounting pronouncements

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures at january 31 2012 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

 our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

in january 2012 we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 400000 rentable square feet at 50 fremont street san francisco ca the cost of the lease is approximately 2090 million over the 18year term of the lease we will take possession of the premises in phases beginning april 1 2012 our commitment is included in the table above 

on june 7 2011 we entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to a california state wage and hour lawsuit that had been filed against us early in 2011 in the superior court of california county of san francisco the settlement agreement is subject to approval of the court which is expected to rule by mid 2012 our current estimate of the expense charge for the settlement is approximately 004 per diluted share this charge is reflected in our financial results for fiscal 2012 

we anticipate making a tax payment of approximately 400 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as a result of the radian6 transaction besides the aforementioned radian6 tax payment the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements for further information see note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

  

during fiscal 2013 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services and technologies and intellectual property rights we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation sk item 10e “use of nongaap financial measures in commission filings” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information our measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure 

nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income 

we use the nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit and nongaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding noncash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period we use these nongaap measures when planning monitoring and evaluating our performance we believe that these nongaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude certain expenses these certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but are made for our longterm benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 

we define nongaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses in each case for the reasons set forth below we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain noncash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these noncash items on our gross margin and operating performance 

 

  

  

   

 we define nongaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles as described above that are included in cost of revenues 

we define nongaap operating profit as our gross profit less operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statement of operations excluding the portions of stockbased expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles as described above that are included in operating expenses 

nongaap earnings per share 

management uses the nongaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 

we define nongaap earnings per share as our nongaap net income which excludes the above components which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 

limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures 

a limitation of our nongaap financial measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies including peer companies and therefore comparability may be limited thus our nongaap measures of nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from measures prepared in accordance with gaap additionally in the case of stockbased expense if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stockbased expense the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 

we compensate for these limitations by reconciling nongaap gross profit nongaap operating profit nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our nongaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 

our reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure of gross profit nongaap operating profit net income and earnings per share to the most comparable gaap measure “gross profit” “income loss from operations” “net income loss attributable to salesforcecom” and “diluted earnings loss per share” for the years ended january 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is as follows in thousands 

 

   

  

  

  

 the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earningsloss per share for the year ended january 31 2012 because we had a net loss for the period and the effect would have been antidilutive the following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic sharecount used in the gaap earningsloss per share calculation to derive the sharecount used for the nongaap diluted earnings per share

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 14 billion at january 31 2012 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2012 could result in a 121 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2011 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 14 billion the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 277 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in january 2010 we issued at par value 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due 2015 the “notes” holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

for the three months ended january 31 2012 the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2012 our common stock traded did not exceed 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are not convertible 

  

the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 075 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our notes was 4961 million as of january 31 2012 this represents the liability component of the 5750 million principal balance as of january 31 2012 the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31 2012 was 8695 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which was 15125 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privatelyheld companies many of which are in the development stage when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for investments in nonmarketable equity and debt securities of the privatelyheld companies using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting as of january 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these investments was 483 million and 211 million respectively

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2012 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2012 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2012 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2012 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications we provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management or crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications 

we were incorporated in delaware in february 1999 and founded on the simple concept of delivering enterprise business applications via the internet or “cloud” cloud computing refers to the use of internetbased computing storage and connectivity technology for a variety of different services we introduced our first service in february 2000 since then we have augmented our crm service with new editions and enhanced features we introduced our forcecom platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm in 2010 we introduced our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our crm service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties we also introduced chatter a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in realtime 

our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom  our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 94105 

  

we designed and developed our applications to be easytouse and intuitive solutions that can be deployed rapidly customized easily and integrated with other software applications we deliver our service through any of the marketleading web browsers customers who use our crm and collaboration services and platform are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations as a result our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity 

we market our service to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and indirectly through partners through our forcecom platform and developer tools and our appexchange we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our platform but which are sold separately from or in conjunction with our crm service 

cloud computing 

cloud computing fundamentally changes the way enterprise business software applications are developed and deployed application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers storage network devices operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application instead the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management and developers simply use an internet browser to access the development environment application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an internet browser or mobile device and are able to take advantage of a robust secure scalable and highly available application without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software infrastructure 

our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multitenant technology architecture and a subscription service business model with multitenancy multiple customers share application platform and infrastructure services provided by the vendor 

today we believe that the next phase of cloud computing is transforming enterprise software again driven by the consumerization of information technology “it” our next phase of cloud computing will have three key characteristics – it will be social mobile and open with the popularity of social networking websites new ways to communicate and collaborate based on feeds and status updates have emerged in the enterprise market that means enabling employees to easily find share and collaborate on information in addition with the wide adoption of mobile phones and tablets our customers now expect cloud computing technologies to be built for business to work on these devices regardless of the carrier or operating system we are working to provide these new kinds of cloud computing technologies to enterprise customers around the world 

cloud applications 

cloud applications enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with few or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software or hardware inhouse 

historically only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning crm and collaboration applications to gain an enterprisewide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes however cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries multitenant architectures enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of the application periodic upgrades more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure 

we believe the shift to cloud applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multitenant infrastructure businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise 

  

software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software as a result we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

cloud platforms 

we believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing however enterprise cloud computing also includes building applications on a cloudbased application development platform also referred to as cloud platforms 

application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers application developers include corporate it departments that typically develop applications for a company’s internaluse and independent software vendors “isvs” that develop applications to sell to customers traditionally these developers have needed to purchase install test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications this requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to actually develop applications with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels 

cloud platforms enable corporate it developers and isvs to leverage the benefits of a multitenant platform for developing new applications cloud platforms allow developers to build applications using only a browser and an internet connection just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser in addition developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment 

our cloud platforms provide application developers access to new capabilities that can be built into their business applications these platforms include features popularized by social networking companies such as profiles status updates and feeds and also the capability to extend applications for use on mobile devices 

our cloud platforms allow both it departments and isv developers to use several programming languages to build their applications while there are many benefits to a language natively associated with a cloud platform developers are able to use the most popular programming languages on our cloud platforms such as java and ruby to build their applications our cloud platforms support multiple languages to provide developers openness and choice 

our solution 

our crm applications help companies better record track manage analyze and share information regarding sales customer service and support and marketing operations in 2010 we introduced salesforce chatter a private social network for businesses our forcecom cloud computing platform which was introduced in 2007 allows customers and partners to more extensively customize and integrate our applications or build entirely new cloud applications beyond crm without having to invest in new software hardware and related infrastructure these newly developed applications which run on our infrastructure can then be used for internal operations or sold to third parties 

we also offer the appexchange an online directory for cloud applications where customers can browse testdrive and deploy applications from salesforcecom and our partners 

  

the majority of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core crm application and forcecom application development platform in order for customers to install and run custom applications whether built by themselves or by our partners they must be a subscriber to our service 

by subscribing to our service our customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software hardware implementation services and it staff as they would with traditional software solutions we believe that our service enables businesses to rapidly achieve the benefits of higher productivity and lower their total cost of ownership for their business application 

key advantages of our solution include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services we also want to be the leading cloud computing platform on which our customers and partners build applications

our crm services are primarily marketed under two brands the sales cloud and the service cloud 

 

  

 as of january 31 2011 we offered five principal service editions contact manager edition group edition professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition chatter is included in each edition we derived over 90 percent of our revenues from subscriptions to and support for our service in fiscal 2011 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services for advanced customers with more complex business needs we provide additional levels of feebased customer support 

in addition to the five editions we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional addon subscriptions to better meet different customers’ needs

we offer various collaboration cloud products such as chatter chatter plus chatter mobile chatter free and chattercom each of these products provides a private and secure corporate social network for companies of all sizes chatter is a core attribute of our forcecom platform and its social capabilities are an integral part of each of our service offerings 

forcecom platform 

the forcecom cloud computing platform which is marketed under our custom cloud brand enhances the attractiveness of our service particularly to enterprise customers the forcecom platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications including data models and objects to manage data a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions and a web services api for programmatic access and integration the forcecom platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to 

 

  

  

  

   

the appexchange 

we offer the appexchange an online directory that provides customers a way to browse testdrive share and install applications developed on our forcecom platform partners and developers can offer their applications on the appexchange directory this directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the forcecom platform to areas that are complementary to or extend beyond crm 

when installing an enterprise cloud computing application built by a thirdparty partner or developer customers authorize the thirdparty provider access to their data because they are built managed and provisioned by third parties we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing 

professional services 

we offer consulting implementation and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing crm application and platform services consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration technical architecture and development configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis we offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing using administering and developing on our service we also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service 

as the reach of our enterprise cloud computing application services has grown partners and other third party consulting and professional service providers play an integral part in providing these services to our customers 

technology development and operations 

technology and development 

we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

  

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as forcecom and salesforce chatter in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology because of our multitenant architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application we are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application 

operations 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and in singapore all of our hosting facilities are currently leased from equinix dupont fabros and ntt except for offerings added through acquisitions which are typically served through alternate facilities 

the equinix dupont fabros and ntt facilities are built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure the facilities are secured by aroundtheclock guards biometric access screening and escort controlled access and are supported by onsite backup generators in the event of a power failure as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime this strategy is designed to both protect our customers’ data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

our agreements with equinix dupont fabros and ntt are for them to supply space in its secure facilities as well as power or connection points for power and internet connectivity bandwidth to the internet is provided by multiple independent companies for all our facilities we continuously monitor the performance of our service the monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles automated load distribution tools and various selfdiagnostic tools and program 

customers 

we sell to businesses of all sizes the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 

sources of revenue 

we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue was over 15 billion as of january 31 2011 and over 10 billion as of january 31 2010 unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our noncancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear for several reasons including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including north america europe and asia pacific which includes japan over 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of north america 

direct sales 

we sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone and field sales personnel that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads our small business general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small mediumsize and large enterprises respectively 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects 

the network includes consulting firms other technology vendors systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer we expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract 

we also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to continually elevate our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will be a greater competitive threat 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information 

as of january 31 2011 we have a number of issued us patents and hundreds of pending us and international patent applications we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others the cost to defend or settle these claims could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter 

employees 

as of january 31 2011 we had 5306 employees none of our employees is represented by a labor union

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software which is developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located in the united states and singapore any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located on the east coast of the united states companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our information technology systems our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability these security 

  

measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize third party technology providers whose applications are available through our appexchange directory to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation disrupt our business lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 24 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for lower cost editions of our service we cannot accurately predict renewal rates particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts and for our small and medium size business customers our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers’ ability to continue their operations and spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are held to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both 

the outcome of any litigation regardless of its merits is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims and lawsuits could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan and require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements 

many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our net income or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks in addition third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate for example our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

  

additionally we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors and the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely the market price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met further our stock price may be affected by financial media including television radio and press reports and blogs 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

as we acquire companies or technologies they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment 

as part of our business strategy we periodically make investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize thirdparty technology partner access to their data we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and warrant the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current competitors include 

 

  

   

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate andor harm our business 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the market for our forcecom cloud computing platform is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us further the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

additionally if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our service and to expand into new geographic areas 

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

periodic changes of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues 

we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements acquisitions sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have some us patents and many 

  

us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

if we fail to develop our brands our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers in the past our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco where we plan to develop our global headquarters if we do not realize these benefits our financial performance will be negatively impacted 

in november 2010 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land which we plan to develop into our global headquarters we may not realize the anticipated benefits with respect to the purchase and future development of such real estate we have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase and we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future to building our global headquarters on such land which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all or complete construction on schedule or within budget any delay or lack of available financing could result in increased constructions costs and debt costs to fund such construction and development in addition our development efforts will otherwise be subject to various operational risks we may not be able to obtain or may experience delays in obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations the construction costs and total investment amounts may exceed any estimates that we formulate and projects may not be completed or delivered as planned finally real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets in the event that we have a future need to sell this property we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31 2011 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

from time to time we may become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment 

we may become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability as well as contract and employmentrelated claims we may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure 

privacy concerns and laws evolving regulation of the internet and other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

  

for example in the united states regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states 

all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

we may lose key members of our management team and development and operations personnel or may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

in addition we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

  

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock and our convertible senior notes due 2015 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating 

  

results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law and our outstanding notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

in addition the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as a result of our sale of the notes in january 2010 we have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because 

 

  

   

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt 

the trading price of the notes may be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock which may be volatile the general level of interest rates and our credit quality 

because the notes are convertible into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and at our election cash andor shares of the company’s common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts the market price of our common stock may significantly affect the trading price of the notes see “ the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation ” above 

in addition the general level of interest rates and our credit quality may significantly affect the trading price of the notes 

we also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall during the term of the notes interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors most of which are beyond our control however if interest rates increase the option value of the notes’ convertibility feature will increase but the yield of the notes will decrease and if interest rates decrease the option value of the notes’ convertibility feature will decrease but the yield of the notes will increase 

in addition our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the notes and will be influenced by a number of factors including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the notes 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes 

as the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions

many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others could be material to our net income or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications we provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management or crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications 

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our enterprise crm application service in february 2000 since then we have augmented our crm service with new editions and enhanced features we introduced our forcecom platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm in 2010 we introduced our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our crm service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties we also introduced chatter a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in realtime 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service the performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our forcecom platform we plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity we also plan to hire additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development as part of our growth plans we intend to continue focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal 

  

additionally we plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities continue to develop our brands add additional distribution channels increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future as such we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2012 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry we expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 

in november 2010 we paid 2780 million in cash for approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage which we plan to develop into our global headquarters 

during fiscal 2011 we acquired several companies to strengthen and extend our service offerings we spent approximately 4033 million net of cash acquired for these companies 

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom “salesforce japan” with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist with our sales efforts in japan during fiscal 2011 we acquired sunbridge’s and other shareholders’ interest in and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of salesforce japan for cash payments totaling 1720 million 

in fiscal 2010 we issued at par 5750 million 075 convertible senior notes “notes” due on january 15 2015 for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2011 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly based on the terms of the notes the notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2011 upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both therefore for the quarter ending april 30 2011 the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2011 and 46 percent for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers and build greater brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2011 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2011 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2011 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service varying service types of offering and the subscription price of our service we define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity eg a company a distinct business unit of a large corporation a partnership etc that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing service we define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customerauthorized users and each such user is who we call a “subscriber” the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 

  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below as we introduce new service offerings we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements as a result when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting in such situations we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract approximately 6 percent of our total deferred revenue as of january 31 2011 and 2010 respectively related to deferred professional services revenue at the start of fiscal 2012 we will be adopting the provisions of asu 200913 adopting this provision will change our accounting for multipleelement arrangements see recent accounting pronouncement 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns additionally our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

  

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter 

 

 cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service for example we plan to open additional data centers in the future additionally as we acquire new businesses and technologies the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the affected periods 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services integrating acquired technologies increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies 

  

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our sharebased payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods if our grant activity remains consistent and our stock price increases in the future stockbased expenses will rise these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

joint venture 

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom “salesforce japan” with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan during fiscal 2011 we acquired sunbridge’s and other shareholders’ interest in and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of salesforce japan as a result of our purchase of the shares held by sunbridge the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms as we did not obtain 100 percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we recorded a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2011 which reflects the interest that we did not control in salesforce japan’s results in fiscal 2011 and all prior years presented 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as an arrangement that includes subscription premium support consulting or training services we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 281 million at january 31 2011 and 191 million at january 31 2010 such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets net 

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2011 we deferred 1212 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 802 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 823 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 639 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 1166 million at january 31 2011 and 755 million at january 31 2010 

business combinations we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed we use the best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to 

  

goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 

accounting for stockbased awards we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years 

we recognized stockbased expense of 1204 million or 7 percent of revenue during fiscal 2011 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2011 we had an aggregate of 5598 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 1951 million during fiscal 2012 1579 million during fiscal 2013 1296 million during fiscal 2014 768 million during fiscal 2015 and 04 million during fiscal 2016 these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2011 and assume no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue sharebased awards to our employees in future periods which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods 

we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs as applicable by jurisdiction when stock options are exercised the impact of stockbased expense in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses additionally we are required to use an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 

as of january 31 2011 there were 32 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding we plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future the restricted stock which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock has an exercise price of 0001 per share which is equal to the par value of our common stock and vest over 4 years the fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant and compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles

 fiscal years ended january 31 2011 and 2010 

revenues 

 

 total revenues were 17 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to 13 billion during the same period a year ago an increase of 3516 million or 27 percent subscription and support revenues were 16 billion or 94 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2011 compared to 12 billion or 93 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago the price per user per month for our three primary offerings professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition in fiscal 2011 has remained substantially consistent relative to fiscal 2010 professional services and other revenues were 1060 million or 6 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2011 compared to 961 million or 7 percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers 

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 5221 million or 32 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2011 compared to 3818 million or 29 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1403 million or 37 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service and our focus on marketing our service internationally additionally the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in us dollar revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago the foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by 76 million compared to the same period a year ago as part of our overall growth we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the americas to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide 

  

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of revenues was 3238 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 compared to 2579 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 659 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 226 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 92 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity an increase of 166 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 132 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 36 million in allocated overhead offset by a decrease of 04 million in stock based expenses the cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by 96 million as compared to 26 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods 

we expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services during fiscal 2012 we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our application service 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses were 1879 million or 11 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2011 compared to 1319 million or 10 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 560 million the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of 420 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 58 million in stockbased expenses and an increase of 56 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since january 31 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses 

marketing and sales

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities was 4591 million during fiscal 2011 and 2709 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base increases in the contract values of our subscription service contracts improving renewal rates and the associated increase in billings and collections cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income sales of subscriptions support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above the timing of commission and bonus payments and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

net cash used in investing activities was 11 billion during fiscal 2011 and 3786 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily related to the purchase of jigsaw heroku dimdim the purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco california investment of cash balances and capital expenditures and strategic investments in public and private companies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in san francisco california including entitlements and improvements associated with the land and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage for approximately 2780 million in cash we plan to use the land to build our new global headquarters and therefore will devote additional financial resources in the future to build our new headquarters

in january 2010 we issued 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due january 15 2015 the “notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “warrants” the notes will mature on january 15 2015 unless earlier converted as of january 31 2011 the notes have not been repurchased or converted we also have not received any shares under the note hedges or delivered cash or shares under the warrants 

for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2011 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2011 upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both therefore for the quarter ending april 30 2011 the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations us agency obligations us treasury securities mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations time deposits money market mutual funds government obligations and municipal securities 

as of january 31 2011 we have a total of 89 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through september 2021 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures at january 31 2011 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

 as of february 1 2011 the notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2011 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2011 upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to 

  

the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both this potential repayment of the notes is not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above 

we have a contractual obligation to begin construction on the undeveloped land by september 2014 if we do not commence construction by this date we will be subject to certain penalties due to a third party these potential penalties are not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above we do not believe we will be subject to these penalties 

our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements for further information see note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

during fiscal 2012 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources to do so we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

recent accounting pronouncement 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605  multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” asu 200913 it updates the existing multipleelement revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc 60525 the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes 1 eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting and 2 requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration in addition the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition asu 200913 will be effective for us at the start of fiscal 2012 we believe the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to our consolidated net income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar swiss franc singapore dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures in accordance with our policy the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 14 billion at january 31 2011 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2011 could result in a 277 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2010 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 17 billion the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 131 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in january 2010 we issued at par value 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due 2015 the “notes” holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

as of february 1 2011 the notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31 2011 our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130 of the conversion price of 8536 per share applicable to the notes accordingly the notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending april 30 2011 upon conversion of any notes we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal 

  

amount of the notes shares of our common stock cash or a combination of both therefore as of february 1 2011 the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 

the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 075 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes however the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our notes was 4725 million as of january 31 2011 this represents the liability component of the 5750 million principal balance as of january 31 2011 the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31 2011 was 9461 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 which was 16455 

we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privatelyheld companies many of which are in the development stage when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting otherwise we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting at january 31 2011 the fair value of these investments was 271 million

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this report the “evaluation date” 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on management’s evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to and are effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2011 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2011 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2011 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications we provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management or crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications 

we were incorporated in delaware in february 1999 and founded on the simple concept of delivering enterprise business applications via the internet or “cloud” cloud computing refers to the use of internetbased computing storage and connectivity technology for a variety of different services we introduced our first service in february 2000 since then we have augmented our crm service with new editions and enhanced features we have also introduced other enterprise cloud computing applications on our forcecom platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm additionally we have introduced our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our crm service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties 

our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom  our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 

94105 

we designed and developed our offering to be an easytouse and intuitive solution that can be deployed rapidly customized easily and integrated with other software applications we deliver our service through any of the marketleading web browsers customers who use our crm services and platform are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations as a result our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity 

  

we market our service to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and indirectly through partners through our forcecom platform and developer tools and our appexchange we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our platform but which are sold separately from or in conjunction with our crm service 

cloud computing 

cloud computing fundamentally changes the way enterprise business software applications are developed and deployed application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers storage network devices operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application instead the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management and developers simply use an internet browser to access the development environment application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an internet browser or mobile device and are able to take advantage of a robust secure scalable and highly available application at a relatively low cost without the cost and complexity of managing the application 

our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multitenancy technology architecture and a subscription service business model with multitenancy multiple customers share application platform and infrastructure services provided by the vendor subscriptions allow customers to pay a set amount over a contract period versus the relatively high upfront costs associated with traditional software 

cloud applications formerly referred to as “softwareasaservice” or “saas” 

cloud applications enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

historically only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning and crm applications to gain an enterprisewide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes however cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries multitenant architecture enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of the application automated upgrades more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure 

we believe the shift to cloud applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multitenant infrastructure businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software as a result we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

cloud platforms formerly referred to as “platformasaservice” or “paas” 

we believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing however enterprise cloud computing also includes building cloud applications on an application development platform this market is called the cloud platform market 

application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers application developers include corporate information technology 

  

“it” departments that typically develop applications for a company’s internal use and independent software vendors “isvs” that develop applications to sell to customers traditionally these developers have needed to purchase install test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications this requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to actually develop applications with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels 

cloud platforms enable corporate it developers and isvs to leverage the benefits of a multitenant platform for developing new applications cloud platforms allow developers to build applications with a browser and an internet connection just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser in addition developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment 

our solution 

our crm applications help companies better record track manage analyze and share information regarding sales customer service and support and marketing operations our forcecom cloud computing platform which was introduced in 2007 allows customers and partners to more extensively customize and integrate our applications or build entirely new cloud applications beyond crm without having to invest in new software hardware and related infrastructure these newly developed applications which are hosted and run on our infrastructure can then be used for internal operations or sold to third parties we also offer the appexchange an online directory for cloud applications where customers can browse testdrive and deploy applications from salesforcecom and our partners since we introduced the appexchange directory in 2006 more than 800 applications developed mostly by our partners have been posted to the directory 

substantially all of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core crm application services all of which include the customization benefits of the forcecom platform in order for customers to install and run custom applications whether built by themselves or by our partners they must be a subscriber to our service 

by subscribing to our service our customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software hardware implementation services and it staff as they would with traditional software solutions we believe that our service enables businesses to rapidly achieve the benefits of higher productivity and lower their total cost of ownership for their business application 

key advantages of our solution include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services we also want to be the leading cloud computing platform on which our customers and partners build applications 

key elements of our strategy include 

 

   

  

  

  

 the salesforce crm service

during fiscal 2010 our services were marketed under the two brands the sales cloud and the service cloud 

 

   

  

 as of january 31 2010 we offered five principal editions of our service for a fee contact manager edition group edition professional edition enterprise edition and unlimited edition we derived over 90 percent of our revenues from subscriptions to and support for our service in fiscal 2010 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services for advanced customers with more complex business needs we provide additional levels of feebased customer support 

in addition to the five paying editions we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional addon subscriptions to better meet different customers’ needs examples include 

 

  

 forcecom platform 

the forcecom cloud computing platform which is marketed under our custom cloud brand enhances the attractiveness of our service particularly to enterprise customers the forcecom platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications including data models and objects to manage data a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions and a web services api for programmatic access and integration the forcecom platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to 

 

  

  

  

 the appexchange 

we offer the appexchange an online directory that provides customers a way to browse testdrive share and install applications developed on our forcecom platform partners and developers can offer their applications on the appexchange directory this directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the forcecom platform to areas that are complementary to or extend beyond crm 

  

when installing an enterprise cloud computing application built by a thirdparty partner or developer customers authorize the thirdparty provider access to their data because they are built managed and provisioned by third parties we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing 

professional services 

we offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our enterprise cloud computing crm application service 

consulting and implementation services 

we offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing crm application and platform services consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration technical architecture and development configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis 

as the reach of our enterprise cloud computing application services grows partners and other third party consulting and professional service providers will likely play a more integral part in also providing these consulting and implementation services to our customers 

training  certification 

we offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing using administering and developing on our service we also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service 

in order to expand our reach to the growing customer base we have also established an authorized training center program that allows authorized third party training partners to deliver training curricula additionally as the population of administrators developers consultants and partners grows we established a training and examination program for salesforce certification in specific areas of expertise 

technology development and operations 

technology and development 

we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custom built and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser 

  

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as forcecom in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application we are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application 

operations 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located on the west and east coasts of the united states additionally we recently started serving customers from a new data center hosting facility in singapore all of our hosting facilities are currently leased from equinix inc except for features added through acquisition which are temporarily served through alternate facilities 

the equinix facilities are built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure the facilities are secured by aroundtheclock guards biometric access screening and escortcontrolled access and are supported by onsite backup generators in the event of a power failure as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime this strategy is designed to both protect our customers’ data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

our agreement with equinix provides for equinix to supply space in its secure facilities as well as power bandwidth to the internet is provided by multiple independent companies we continuously monitor the performance of our service the monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles automated load distribution tools and various selfdiagnostic tools and programs 

in addition we have a data center in san francisco which is primarily for internal information technology development and quality assurance infrastructure 

customers 

our revenues are divided among small businesses companies with fewer than 200 employees mediumsize businesses 200 or more employees and up to 1 billion in annual revenues and large businesses over 1 billion in annual revenues the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

sources of revenue 

we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of an annual or multiyear noncancelable subscription agreements unbilled deferred revenue was over 10 billion as of january 31 2010 

  

and over 7000 million as of january 31 2009 unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our noncancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and accordingly are not recorded in deferred revenue we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue may change from yeartoyear for several reasons including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements varying billing cycles of noncancelable subscription agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances for multiyear subscription agreements billed annually the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero just prior to renewal and increases if the agreement is renewed low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from yeartoyear depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including north america europe japan and the asia pacific region other than japan 

direct sales 

we sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone and field sales personnel that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads our small business general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small mediumsize and large enterprises respectively 

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects 

the network includes consulting firms other technology vendors systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer we expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract 

we also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to continually elevate our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers 

our primary marketing activities include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 customer service and support 

our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquires from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by the web telephone and email 

basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying editions premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services such as an assigned support representative andor administrator premier customer support is available for a separate fee or is included in our unlimited edition additional support services include developer support and partner support 

international sales 

we generate approximately 30 percent of our total revenues from customers in europe and asia pacific including japan we expect international markets to provide increased opportunities for our applications and services in the future our current international efforts are focused on strengthening our direct sales and marketing presence outside of north america and generating more revenues from these regions 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

competition 

the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

   

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will be a greater competitive threat 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information 

as of january 31 2010 we have several issued us patents and many pending us and international patent applications we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others the cost to defend or settle these claims could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims against their use the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter 

  

employees 

as of january 31 2010 we had 3969 employees none of our employees is represented by a labor union

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center hosting facilities located on the west and east coasts of the united states additionally we recently started serving customers from a new data center hosting facility in singapore any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers we may move or transfer our data and our customers’ data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a facility located on the east coast features added through 

  

acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability these security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition our customers may authorize third party technology providers whose applications are available through our appexchange directory to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales 

weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit going concern threats to major multinational companies and medium and small businesses poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing application service delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be 

  

recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 24 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for lower cost editions of our service we cannot accurately predict renewal rates particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts and for our small and medium size business customers our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers’ ability to continue their operations and spending levels decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors including general economic conditions if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to our evolving business model the unpredictability of new markets that we enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others during fiscal 2009 we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we were infringing some of their patents we continue to analyze the potential merits of their claims the potential defenses to such claims and potential counter claims and the possibility of a license agreement as an alternative to litigation we are currently in discussions with this company and no litigation has been filed to date however there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future the resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims 

  

against their use the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims including the one referenced above with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate for example our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals the yearoveryear compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 

additionally some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

additionally we may also fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors and the market price of our common stock moreover our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met 

as we acquire companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

if the market for our technology delivery model and an enterprise cloud computing application service develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in addition for those customers who authorize thirdparty technology partners access to their data we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and warrant the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future the market for our forcecom cloud computing platform is new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

since we were formed in 1999 we have experienced significant growth in our customer base which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our 

  

operations and increase productivity to address the needs of our customers to further develop and enhance our service and to expand into new geographic areas 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues 

we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

  

our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners 

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers’ business needs professional services may be performed by our own staff or by a third party or a combination of the two our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have a few us patents and many us and international patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

if we fail to develop our brands our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers in the past our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31 2010 

  

and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally our international subscription fees are paid either in us dollars or local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to 

  

resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

for example in the united states regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states 

all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and growing customer base 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated services as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees in addition since we expense all stockbased compensation we may periodically change our stock compensation practices which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for options or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

  

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including for example the securities and exchange commission which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from sharebased compensation the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

in addition we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock and our convertible senior notes due 2015 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

our executive officers directors and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders if they act together or in a block could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as a result of our sale of 5750 million of 075 percent convertible senior notes in january 2010 the “notes” we now have longterm debt that we have not had to maintain in the past 

our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because 

 

  

  

 our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulations our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt if we fail to make a payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt 

we expect that the trading price of the notes will be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock which may be volatile the general level of interest rates and our credit quality 

the market price of our common stock as well as the general level of interest rates and our credit quality will likely significantly affect the trading price of the notes our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 

we cannot predict whether the market price of our common stock will rise or fall the market price of our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors including general market conditions variations in our operating results earnings per share cash flows deferred revenue other financial and nonfinancial metrics and other factors described in greater detail elsewhere in this section many of which are beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock also could be affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view the notes as an attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage 

  

activity involving our common stock that we expect to develop as a result of the issuance of the notes the hedging or arbitrage activity could in turn affect the trading prices of the notes 

we also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall during the term of the notes interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors most of which are beyond our control however if interest rates increase the option value of the notes’ convertibility feature will increase but the yield of the notes will decrease and if interest rates decrease the option value of the notes’ convertibility feature will decrease but the yield of the notes will increase 

in addition our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the notes and will be influenced by a number of factors including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the notes 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock including in connection with the conversion of the notes and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock during the life of the notes if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in turn the trading price of the notes in addition the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock 

the notes and the indenture that will govern the notes contain limited protections against certain types of important corporate events and may not protect your investment upon the occurrence of such corporate events and will not protect your investment upon the occurrence of other corporate events 

the indenture for the notes does not 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 furthermore the indenture for the notes contains only limited protections in the event of a change in control we could engage in many types of transactions such as certain acquisitions refinancings or recapitalizations that could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of the notes and our common 

  

stock but would not constitute a “fundamental change” that permits holders to require us to purchase their notes under the indenture 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repay the notes 

there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or will be able to arrange financing to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion in addition agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them furthermore our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority in addition if we fail to purchase the notes to pay interest due on or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion we will be in default under the indenture our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes 

the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 

the fundamental change purchase rights which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock 

we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the notes we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties taken together the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected but not guaranteed to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes 

as the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we may become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock in addition upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties 

  

our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds from our debt issuance and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment 

our management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from debt issuance and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds they might not apply the net proceeds of this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses joint ventures services or technologies working capital and capital expenditures however other than paying the cost of the convertible note hedge after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions we have not allocated these net proceeds for any specific purposes our management might not be able to yield a significant return if any on any investment of these net proceeds

overview 

we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications we provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management or crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications 

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our enterprise crm application service in february 2000 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service the performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our forcecom platform we also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity we also plan to hire additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development as part of our growth plans we will have additional focus in the area of retaining customers at the time of renewal we also plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities add additional distribution channels increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies expand our focus in the locations around the world where we conduct business and add to our infrastructure to support our growth we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses joint ventures services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service crm offerings we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future 

  

in fiscal 2010 we issued at par 5750 million 075 convertible senior notes due on january 15 2015 in connection with the issuance of the debt we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes the note hedges transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion 

separately we also entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to acquire subject to antidilution adjustments shares of our common stock at a strike price of 11951 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 46 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2010 and 50 percent for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers and build brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2010 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2010 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below as we introduce new service offerings we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements as a result when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting in such situations we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract approximately 6 percent and 7 percent of our total deferred revenue as of january 31 2010 and 2009 respectively related to deferred professional services revenue 

  

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns additionally our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter 

 

 cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service our proprietary scalable and 

  

secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff referral fees paid to partners the cost of marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 

stockbased expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors we recognize our sharebased payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan during the prior fiscal year we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent because of this controlling interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record a noncontrolling interest which reflects the interest that we do not control in the venture’s results through january 31 2010 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture have not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as an arrangement that includes subscription premium support consulting or training services we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 191 million at january 31 2010 and 173 million at january 31 2009 such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets 

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales representatives the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

  

during fiscal 2010 we deferred 823 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 639 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 637 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 587 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 755 million at january 31 2010 and 571 million at january 31 2009 

accounting for stockbased awards we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of approximately four years 

we recognized stockbased expense of 889 million or 7 percent of revenue during fiscal 2010 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2010 we had an aggregate of 2836 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 1158 million during fiscal 2011 893 million during fiscal 2012 525 million during fiscal 2013 and 260 million during fiscal 2014 these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2010 and assume no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue sharebased awards to our employees in future periods 

we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs when stock options are exercised the impact of stockbased expense in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses additionally we are required to use an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 

as of january 31 2010 there were 23 million restricted stock units outstanding we plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future the restricted stock units which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit have an exercise price of 0001 per share which is equal to the par value of our common stock and vest over 4 years the fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant and compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items prior year income tax uncertainties or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from stockbased awards and the changes in tax laws and accounting principles

 cost of revenues was 2579 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2010 compared to 2205 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 374 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 84 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 15 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 72 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity an increase of 98 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 67 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 16 

  

million in allocated overhead the cost of the professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010 by 26 million as compared to 12 million during fiscal 2009 

as described above we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 

we expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2011 we plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our application service additionally as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized

our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for the same period a year ago the decrease was due to a higher proportion of income in countries with lower income tax rates than the us statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits the total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stockbased compensation was 321 million for the current fiscal year see note 7 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

in addition in february 2009 the state of california enacted several income tax law changes which include an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result we revalued the anticipated future tax effects of our california temporary differences including stockbased compensation and purchased intangibles accordingly we recorded an income tax expense of 27 million during the fiscal 2010 related to this tax law change

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2010 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 17 billion and accounts receivable of 3210 million 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2709 million during fiscal 2010 and 2296 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income sales of subscriptions and support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above and the timing of commission and bonus payments collections from large enterprise customers and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

net cash used in investing activities was 3786 million during fiscal 2010 and 1210 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily related to the investment of cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements and the purchase of software licenses computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure number of offices around the world and work force additionally during the year we purchased two privately held companies for approximately 120 million and invested approximately 44 million in other privatelyheld companies 

net cash provided by financing activities was 6372 million during fiscal 2010 and 969 million during the same period a year ago net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2010 substantially consisted of the net proceeds of 4999 million related to our issuance of convertible notes and associated hedge transactions described below in addition we had 939 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and 515 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans 

  

in january 2010 we issued 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due january 15 2015 the “notes” and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the “note hedges” and separate warrant transactions the “warrants” the notes will mature on january 15 2015 unless earlier converted as of january 31 2010 the notes have not been repurchased or converted we also have not received any shares under the note hedges or delivered cash or shares under the warrants for further information see note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations us treasury securities us agency obligations time deposits money market mutual funds 

as of january 31 2010 we have a total of 106 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in san francisco california new york city singapore sweden and switzerland to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through october 2018 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures we also have longterm liabilities related to the issuance of the notes the stated interest rate is 075 at january 31 2010 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

 our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements for further information see note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

during fiscal 2011 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued update no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605  multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” asu 200913 it updates the existing multipleelement revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc 60525 the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes 1 eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting and 2 requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration in addition the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition asu 200913 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june 15 2010 with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption we are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement to our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 17 billion at january 31 2010 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 

an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2010 could result in a 131 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity 

  

model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2009 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 8826 million the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 23 million 

market risk and market interest risk 

in january 2010 we issued at par value 5750 million of 075 convertible senior notes due 2015 the “notes” holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the notes we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

our notes have fixed annual interest rates at 075 and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our notes however the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price the carrying value of our notes was 4502 million as of january 31 2010 this represents the liability component of the 5750 million principal balance as of january 31 2010 the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31 2010 was 5452 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per 100 of our notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 which was 9482 for further information see note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2010 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2010 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2010 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the 

  

inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we were incorporated in delaware in february 1999 founded on the simple concept of delivering enterprise business applications via the internet and we introduced our first service offering in february 2000 since then we have augmented our crm service with new editions and enhanced features introduced other enterprise cloud computing applications on our forcecom cloud computing platform that allows customers and developers to build applications that are complementary to or extend beyond crm and introduced our forcecom appexchange directory or appexchange of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our crm service and in many cases were developed on our platform by third parties 

our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom  our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 94105 

we designed and developed our offering to be an easytouse and intuitive solution that can be deployed rapidly can be customized easily and can be integrated with other software applications we deliver our service through a standard web browser customers who use our enterprise cloud computing crm service and platform are able to avoid many of the expenses and complexities of traditional enterprise software development and implementations as a result our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity 

  

we market our service to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners our revenues have increased from 749 million in fiscal 2008 to 1077 million in fiscal 2009 as of january 31 2009 our customer base had grown to approximately 55400 worldwide from approximately 41000 customers a year ago 

through our forcecom cloud computing platform and developer tools and our appexchange directory we also encourage third parties including customers and independent software vendors to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our platform but which are sold separately from or in conjunction with our crm service 

industry background 

the enterprise application software market 

over the last thirtyfive years there have been several shifts in the way vendors deliver enterprise software applications in the 1970s and 1980s companies deployed application software through centralized mainframe based systems in the 1990s the mainframe model evolved to clientserver computing in which applications were run in a more distributed model historically only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning or erp and crm applications to gain an enterprisewide view of all business information and automate and improve basic processes in addition large businesses attempted to customize and connect various incompatible packaged applications through timeconsuming extensive and costly integration efforts however many large enterprises never realized the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons including the difficulty of deployment low user adoption rates lack of ubiquitous access high total cost of ownership and a relatively low return on investment 

in an attempt to address these challenges many enterprise software application vendors adapted their clientserver products to be accessible over the internet however because these hosted applications were not originally designed to be delivered over the internet they failed to provide the level of access and economies of scale of a multitenant solution which allows all users and applications to share a single common hardware infrastructure and software code base that is centrally maintained as such hosted clientserver applications remain limited in their ability to address the needs of large and small businesses 

cloud computing 

cloud computing refers to the use of internet “cloud” based computing storage and connectivity technology for a variety of different services the pervasiveness of the internet along with the dramatic decline in the pricing of the technology components has enabled this new generation of computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtual resources are provided as a service to both enterprises and consumers users need not have knowledge of expertise in or control over the technology infrastructure “in the cloud” that supports them 

in the context of enterprise business applications cloud computing fundamentally changes the way business applications are developed and deployed application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers storage network devices operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application instead the entire infrastructure is managed in the cloud and developers simply use an internet browser to access the development environment application users are able to gain access to a variety of business applications via an internet browser or mobile device and are able to take advantage of a robust secure scalable and highly available application at a relatively low cost without the cost and complexity of managing the application 

enterprise cloud computing which refers to business applications that are developed using the cloud and a technology platform that customers and developers use to build and run business applications includes both application softwareasaservice for users and platformasaservice for developers 

  

softwareasaservice “saas” 

saas enables businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

saas contrasts with the traditional enterprise software model which requires each customer to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services to implement a software application inhouse moreover traditional enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices and operating environments as a result they either have to dedicate fewer resources to innovation or incur higher research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue compared with ondemand application service providers 

we believe the market should not discriminate between small and large companies and businesses of all sizes and across all industries should be able to use the same software based on a multitenant architecture this architecture enables us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all customers who benefit from access to the most current release of the application automated upgrades more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure 

we believe the shift to saas applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multitenant infrastructure businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs of owning enterprise software as a result we believe the continued emergence of saas applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

platformasaservice “paas” 

we believe that saas applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing however enterprise cloud computing also includes building saas applications on an application development platform this market is called platformasaservice 

application developers use paas technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers application developers include corporate information technology it departments that typically develop applications for a company’s internal use and independent software vendors isvs that develop applications to sell to customers traditionally these developers have needed to purchase install test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications this requirement resulted in more time and resources spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to develop applications with a resulting impact on innovation and productivity levels 

paas enables corporate it developers and isvs to leverage the benefits of a multitenant platform for developing new applications paas allows developers to build applications with a browser and an internet connection just as saas allows users to use applications through a browser 

our solution 

our flagship salesforce crm applications which were initially introduced in february 2000 help companies better record track manage analyze and share information regarding sales customer service and support and marketing operations our forcecom cloud computing platform which was introduced in 2007 allows customers and partners to more extensively customize and integrate salesforce crm applications or build entirely new saas applications beyond crm without having to invest in new software hardware and related 

  

infrastructure these newly developed applications which are hosted and run on our infrastructure can then be used for internal operations or sold to third parties we also offer the appexchange an online directory for saas applications where customers can browse testdrive and install applications from salesforcecom and our partners since we introduced the appexchange directory in 2006 more than 800 applications developed mostly by our partners have been posted to the directory 

substantially all of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core crm application services all of which include the customization benefits of the forcecom platform customers can also build their own application services on the forcecom platform or install those built on forcecom by partners from the appexchange in order for customers to install and run custom applications whether built by themselves or by our partners they must be a subscriber to our service 

as of january 31 2009 our customer base had grown to approximately 55400 worldwide we provide our service to organizations through our proprietary scalable and secure enterprise cloud computing multitenant application architecture which allows us to serve large numbers of customers costeffectively 

by subscribing to our service our customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software hardware implementation services and it staff as they would with traditional software solutions we believe that our service enables businesses to rapidly achieve the benefits of higher productivity and lower their total cost of ownership for their business application 

key advantages of our solution include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services we also want to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build saas applications key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 the salesforce crm service

 as of january 31 2009 we offer five principal editions of our service for a fee group edition professional edition enterprise edition unlimited edition and partner edition we derived over 90 percent of our revenues from subscriptions to and support for our service in fiscal 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services with phone support available 12 hours a day five days a week for advanced customers with more complex business needs we provide additional levels of feebased customer support 

in addition to the five paying editions we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional addon subscriptions to better meet different customers’ needs examples include 

 

  

  

  

 as part of our marketing programs we also offer a single user personal edition service that includes a contact management database and several other features that are useful to individual sales representatives and others who need a centralized way to organize contact data and access that data over the internet we also offer a developer edition to developers and others interested in building applications on our forcecom platform both personal edition and developer edition are currently available at no charge 

  

forcecom cloud computing platform 

the forcecom cloud computing platform enhances the attractiveness of our service particularly to enterprise customers the forcecom platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications including data models and objects to manage data a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions and a web services api for programmatic access and integration the forcecom platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to 

 

  

  

  

 the appexchange 

we offer the appexchange an online directory that provides customers a way to browse testdrive share and install applications developed on our forcecom platform partners and developers can offer their applications on the appexchange directory this directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the forcecom platform to areas that are complementary to or extend beyond crm 

when installing an enterprise cloud computing application built by a thirdparty partner or developer customers authorize the thirdparty provider access to their data because they are built managed and provisioned by third parties we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing 

professional services 

we offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our enterprise cloud computing crm application service 

consulting and implementation services 

we offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing crm application and platform services consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration technical architecture and development configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis for many of our small and mediumsized business customers we also offer for a fixed price certain implementation services that take up to a week to complete 

as the reach of our enterprise cloud computing application services grows partners will likely play a more integral part in also providing these consulting and implementation services to our customers 

training  certification 

we offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing using administering and developing on our service we also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers 

we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our 

  

service in 2008 we also introduced a certification program to provide accredited certifications for salesforce crm administrators forcecom developers and consultants 

in order to expand our reach to the growing customer base we have also established the authorized training center program that allows authorized third party training partners to deliver training curriculum additionally as the population of administrators developers consultants and partners grows a training and exam program has been established for salesforce certification in specific areas of expertise 

technology development and operations 

technology and development 

we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser without installing any software or downloading java applets or microsoft activex or net controls 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as forcecom in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application we are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application 

operations 

as of january 31 2009 we serve our customers and users from a single thirdparty web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states leased from equinix inc except for features added through acquisition which are temporarily served through alternate facilities the equinix facility is built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure the facility is secured by aroundtheclock guards biometric access screening and escortcontrolled access and is supported by onsite backup generators in the event of a power failure as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate backup facility located on the east 

  

coast of the united states this strategy is designed to both protect our customers’ data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

our agreement with equinix provides for equinix to supply space in its secure facilities on the west and east coasts as well as power bandwidth to the internet is provided by multiple independent companies we continuously monitor the performance of our service the monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles automated load distribution tools and various selfdiagnostic tools and programs 

in addition we have a data center in san francisco which is primarily for internal information technology development and quality assurance infrastructure 

we are opening a data center in singapore in fiscal 2010

our revenues are divided among small businesses companies with fewer than 200 employees mediumsize businesses 200 or more employees and up to 1 billion in annual revenues and large businesses over 1 billion in annual revenues the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands 

none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

sales marketing and customer support 

we organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions including north america europe japan and the asia pacific region other than japan 

direct sales

referral and indirect sales 

we have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects the network includes consulting firms other technology vendors systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence in return we typically pay these partners a fee based on the firstyear subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer we expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract 

we also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service 

  

marketing 

our marketing strategy is to continually elevate our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings we use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers partners and developers

we generate over 25 percent of our total revenues from customers in europe and asia pacific including japan we expect international markets to provide increased opportunities for our applications and services in the future our current international efforts are focused on strengthening our direct sales and marketing presence outside of north america and generating more revenues from these regions 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business for a more detailed discussion see the “seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable” discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

  

competition 

the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing they will be a greater competitive threat 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources they may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs additionally our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance 

our professional services organization may compete with some systems integrators including accenture ltd deloitte consulting and ibm corporation it may also compete with some isv service providers that have service practices we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information 

as of january 31 2009 we have four issued us patents and 117 pending us patent applications the majority of our patent applications concern database application platform and application exchange infrastructures

we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others the cost to defend or settle these claims can be significant in any single quarter any intellectual property claims regardless of merit may also require us to seek licenses to that technology in addition we license thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our services licenses from thirdparty technologies may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or on reasonable commercial terms or at all additionally the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our services if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately our competitors could offer similar services potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues 

  

employees 

as of january 31 2009 we had 3566 employees 

we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract motivate and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business none of our employees is represented by a labor union we consider our relationship with our employees to be good however we face competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from a thirdparty data center hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states and we plan to begin to serve some customers from a thirdparty data center hosting facility located on the east coast of the united states additionally we plan to begin serving customers from a new data center hosting facility we will be opening in singapore in fiscal 2010 any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service as we continue to add capacity in our existing and future data centers we may move or transfer data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue 

  

credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate standby facility located on the east coast features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of our service that would harm our future business prospects because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers in addition our customers may authorize third party technology providers whose applications are available through our appexchange directory to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

weakening global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions the united states and other key international economies are currently undergoing a period of severe recession characterized by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit going concern threats to financial institutions and major multinational companies poor liquidity declining asset values reduced corporate profitability extreme volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets and increased bankruptcies these conditions could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing application service delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates all of which could adversely affect our operating results companies that have competing products may reduce prices for competing products or services which could also reduce our average selling prices and harm our operating results 

  

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet and the revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed and our stock price may decline without advance notice 

due to our evolving business model the unpredictability of new markets that we enter and deteriorating general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the rate of new or renewed subscriptions falls short of our expectations 

as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we cannot accurately predict customer subscription renewal rates and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 24 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions or renew for shorter contract lengths we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with our service their ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic and financial market conditions if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management if these efforts are not successful our business may suffer 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price 

  

may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met some of the important factors that could cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

many of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and cause us to incur additional liabilities 

in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory an online marketplace for enterprise cloud computing applications that run on our forcecom cloud computing platform the market for thirdparty ondemand applications and our platform is new and unproven and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us among other things the success of the appexchange will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of thirdparty technology providers to write enterprise cloud computing applications that run on our platform and the willingness of enterprises large and small to purchase and deploy these applications if thirdparty technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our online application marketplace then the market for this initiative may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would affect our ability to grow our revenue given this new and unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative in addition our customers may not authorize such thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data if our customers do authorize such access we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing further despite contract provisions designed to protect us customers may look to us to support and warrant the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell moreover the appexchange directory and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business which may harm our business 

the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing application services is immature and volatile and if it develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business our success also depends on the willingness of third 

  

party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for crm enterprise business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products 

we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future for small business customers we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors but who also have directly competitive ondemand crm application services offerings 

our professional services organization may compete with some systems integrators including accenture ltd deloitte consulting and ibm corporation it may also compete with some isv service providers that have service practices we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them 

many of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater 

  

financial technical and other resources in addition many of our competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

if our enterprise cloud computing application service is not widely accepted in markets where we have few customers our future growth will be limited 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future as a result widespread acceptance of our service by companies located outside the united states or in industries where we currently have few customers is critical to our future growth factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are beyond our control the inability of our enterprise cloud computing application service to achieve widespread market acceptance as described above would harm our business 

our past and anticipated future growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we have experienced and may continue to experience a period of increasing headcount and growth in our operations to support a growing customer base which has placed and will continue to place to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure will be required to address increases in our customer base further development of our service as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively to do so we must continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed if our new hires perform poorly or if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmed to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional 

  

headcount and capital investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues 

we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements sales performance increases in sales headcount cost levels and other internal and external considerations in the past these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or 

  

invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have a few us patents and many other us patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims or rights against their use any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others 

if we fail to develop our brands costeffectively our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand and our other brands in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable secure and useful services at competitive prices in the past our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth 

we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers particularly large enterprise customers and to manage our customer base we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need our ability to achieve 

  

significant growth in revenue in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and may in some cases take more than a year before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded in addition we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging thirdparty resellers because of our enterprise cloud computing service model the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business financial and other resources if we are unable to structure successful thirdparty channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering our growth will be inhibited 

our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners 

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers’ business needs professional services may be performed by our own staff or by a third party or a combination of the two our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represent over 25 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

additionally some of our international subscription fees are currently paid in local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies however have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

for example in the united states regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service 

the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service many if not most other jurisdictions including asia countries have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

  

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business 

we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies 

we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

to continue to execute on our business plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services and senior sales executives we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience in the future difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they are to receive in connection with their employment volatility in the price of our stock and the cost to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join or stay with our company if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

as we acquire companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies in the future in august 2008 we acquired instranet inc acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline 

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including for example the securities and exchange commission which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

we are required to comply on an ongoing basis with the sarbanesoxley act or sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources 

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate has fluctuated over the past fiscal year the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from stock option compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages and other events beyond our 

  

control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services the majority of our research and development activities corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations for example during the year ended january 31 2009 the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a closing price of 2196 to 7443 per share factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 

if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock the price of our stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or lower their future stock price targets or estimates of our operating results our 

  

stock price could decline rapidly furthermore if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

our executive officers directors and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock 

as a result these stockholders if they act together or in a block could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our enterprise crm application service in february 2000 

our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build softwareasaservice applications key elements of our strategy include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service the performance and security of our service our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features successful customer adoption and utilization of our service acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors the location of new data centers thirdparty developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service or delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 

to address these factors we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of thirdparty applications on our forcecom platform we also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally and towards this end we are opening a new data center in singapore in fiscal 2010 we also plan to hire additional personnel particularly in direct sales other customerrelated areas and research and development during the year ended january 31 2009 we added 960 employees and our headcount as of january 31 2009 was 3566 we also plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities add additional distribution channels increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business add to our infrastructure to support our growth additionally in 

  

our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies 

in august 2008 we acquired instranet inc which offers a knowledge management application for business to consumer call centers we acquired instranet inc for its developed technology in order to expand our crm customer service and support offerings in the customer service and support market additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we increased our ownership in our japanese joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2009 and the same for the period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers and build brand awareness 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2009 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2009 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2009 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” or sab 104 and emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” or eitf 0021 in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below as we introduce new service offerings we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements as a result when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting in such situations we recognize the entire 

  

arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract approximately 7 percent and 8 percent of our total deferred revenue as of january 31 2009 and 2008 respectively related to deferred professional services revenue 

seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable 

deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns additionally our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

accordingly the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter 

the following table sets forth our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of the end of each fiscal quarter 

 

 cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues  cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment costs associated with website development activities allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs 

  

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period for example we intend to open a data center in singapore in fiscal 2010 we expect the annual cost to be significant 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 

stockbased expenses  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors we account for stockbased expenses pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which we adopted on february 1 2006 sfas 123r requires that sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future 

joint venture 

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent because of this majority interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record minority interest which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results through january 31 2009 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture have not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab 104 and eitf 0021 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as an arrangement that includes subscription premium support consulting or training services we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 173 million at january 31 2009 and 139 million at january 31 2008 such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets 

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related 

  

subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2009 we deferred 637 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 587 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 627 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 422 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 571 million at january 31 2009 and 521 million at january 31 2008 

accounting for stockbased awards we account for sharebased compensation under sfas 123r we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years 

we recognized stockbased expense of 774 million or 7 percent of revenue during fiscal 2009 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2009 we had an aggregate of 2613 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 1051 million during fiscal 2010 830 million during fiscal 2011 550 million during fiscal 2012 and 182 million during fiscal 2013 these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2009 and assume no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue sharebased awards to our employees in future periods 

we grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world in certain foreign jurisdictions we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards pursuant to sfas 123r we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise the impact of sfas 123r in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses additionally the application of sfas 123r requires the use of an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 

as of january 31 2009 there were 25 million restricted stock units outstanding we plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future the restricted stock units which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit have an exercise price of 0001 per share which is equal to the par value of our common stock and vest over 4 years the fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant and compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

  

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from sfas 123r and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities

fiscal years ended january 31 2009 and 2008 

revenues 

 

 total revenues were 10768 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 7487 million during the same period a year ago an increase of 3281 million or 44 percent subscription and support revenues were 9846 million or 91 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2009 compared to 6806 million or 91 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to an increased number of new customers additional paying subscriptions from existing customers and customers who have upgraded professional services and other revenues were 922 million or 9 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2009 compared to 681 million or 9 percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers 

  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 3003 million or 28 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2009 compared to 1907 million or 25 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1096 million or 57 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally additionally the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended january 31 2009 as compared the same period year ago the foreign currency impact compared to the same period a year ago was an increase of 66 million as part of our overall growth we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in europe and asia pacific to continue to increase as a larger percentage of our total revenues world wide

 cost of revenues was 2205 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2009 compared to 1716 million or 23 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 489 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 138 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 31 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 99 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity an increase of 72 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 107 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 33 million in allocated overhead the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 by 12 million as compared to 122 million during fiscal 2008 this reduction was the result of increasing the utilization of existing professional services staff utilizing more outside subcontractors and not significantly increasing professional services headcount 

as described above we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service the timing of these additional expenses as well as the costs related to our new data center in singapore will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 

we expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010 we plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing application service additionally as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized

net cash provided by operating activities was 2296 million during fiscal 2009 and 2043 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income sales of subscriptions support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above the timing of commission and bonus payments collections from large enterprise customers addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

net cash used in investing activities was 1210 million during fiscal 2009 and 1027 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily related to the acquisition of instranet inc and the purchase of shares of salesforce japan from the minority shareholders in addition our investing activities included the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures in leasehold improvements and the purchase of software licenses computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure number of offices around the world and work force we expanded one of our existing software license agreements to provide additional capacity in our business operations at a cost of 80 million the company during the year invested approximately 20 million in system integrators and softwareasaservice isvs 

net cash provided by financing activities was 969 million during fiscal 2009 and 927 million during the same period a year ago net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 substantially consisted of 433 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and 546 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans 

  

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate notes and obligations us agency obligations time deposits money market mutual funds assetbacked securities and an investment in the reserve primary fund “the reserve fund” a money market mutual fund that suspended redemptions and is in the process of being liquidated 

as of january 31 2009 our investment portfolio included 195 million invested in the reserve fund with an estimated fair value of 183 million during the year ended january 31 2009 we recorded a 12 million loss related to this decline in fair value that is considered otherthantemporary while we believe we have the rights to the recovery of the entire 195 million investment we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive therefore we have recorded the aforementioned otherthantemporary loss subsequent to january 31 2009 we received an additional 61 million redemption from the reserve fund 

as of january 31 2009 we have a total of 83 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in san francisco california new york city singapore sweden and switzerland to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through december 2016 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for data center capacity and the development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures at january 31 2009 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

 our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

we adopted financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  “fin 48” on february 1 2007 we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above for further information see note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

during fiscal 2010 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in april 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp no 1423 “ determination of the useful life of intangible assets ” fsp no 1423 that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 fsp no 1423 requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under sfas no 141r the fsp also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset’s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity’s intent andor ability to renew or extend the arrangement fsp no 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is applied prospectively we do not expect the adoption of fsp no 1423 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “ disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133 ” sfas 161 the standard requires additional quantitative disclosures provided in tabular form and qualitative disclosures for derivative instruments the required disclosures include how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the relative volume of derivative activity the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments the accounting treatment for those derivative instruments formally designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship and the existence and nature of creditriskrelated contingent features for derivatives sfas 161 does not change the accounting treatment for derivative instruments sfas 161 is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position 1571 “ application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13 ” fsp 1571 and fsp 1572 “ effective date of fasb statement no 157 ” fsp 1572 fsp 1571 amends sfas no 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope and was effective upon initial adoption of sfas no 157 fsp 1572 delays the effective date of sfas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the adoption of sfas 157 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “ business combinations ” sfas 141r under sfas 141r an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date it further requires that acquisitionrelated costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes in addition acquired inprocess research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life sfas 141r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of february 1 2009 the adoption of sfas 141r is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160 “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 ” or sfas 160 the standard changes the accounting for noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders’ equity and the elimination of “minority interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings additionally sfas 160 revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership interest should we increase our ownership interest in salesforce japan the cost would be recorded as a reduction of our stockholders’ equity as opposed to accounting for the purchase as a step acquisition which requires an allocation of the purchase price sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we believe that the adoption of sfas 160 will not have a material impact on our results of operations and consolidated balance sheet

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

prior to october 31 2008 our practice was to settle foreign currency contracts prior to each quarter end because the maturities of the foreign currency contracts were less than 3 months we have continued our practice of entering into foreign currency contracts with maturities less than 3 months as of january 31 2009 the contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 8826 million at january 31 2009 these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 115 accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available for sale” under sfas no 115 our marketable securities include corporate notes and obligations us treasuries us agency obligations time deposits assetbacked securities and money market mutual funds 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points at january 31 2009 could result in a 23 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model 

  

that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

as previously discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” we have an investment in the reserve fund a money market mutual fund while we believe we have the rights to the recovery of our entire investment we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive 

at january 31 2008 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 6698 million the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 32 million

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2009 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2009 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2009 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the 

  

inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

our principal executive offices are located in san francisco california and our principal website address is wwwsalesforcecom  our office address is the landmark  one market suite 300 san francisco california 94105 

we designed and developed our hosted crm service to be an easytouse and intuitive application that can be deployed quickly can be customized and can be integrated with other software applications we deliver our service through a standard web browser customers who use our ondemand crm service and technology platform are able to avoid many of the expenses and complexities of traditional enterprise software implementations and development as a result our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity 

  

we market our service to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners we continue to be in a period of rapid growth our revenues have increased from 497 million in fiscal 2007 to 749 million in fiscal 2008 as of january 31 2008 our customer base had grown to approximately 41000 worldwide from approximately 29800 customers a year ago and as of january 31 2008 we had approximately 11 million paying subscriptions we define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customerauthorized users that have not been suspended for nonpayment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue 

through our forcecom platform and developer tools and our appexchange directory we also encourage third parties including customers and independent software vendors to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our technology platform but are sold separately from or in conjunction with our crm service 

industry background 

the enterprise application software market 

over the last thirtyfive years there have been several shifts in the way vendors deliver enterprise software applications in the 1970s and 1980s vendors delivered application software through centralized mainframe based systems this evolved in the 1990s to clientserver computing historically only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning or erp and crm applications to gain an enterprisewide view and automate and improve basic processes in addition large businesses attempted to customize and connect various incompatible packaged applications through timeconsuming extensive and costly integration efforts however many large enterprises never realized the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons including the difficulty of deployment low user adoption rates lack of ubiquitous access high total cost of ownership and a relatively low return on investment 

in an attempt to address these challenges many enterprise software application vendors adapted their products to be accessible over the internet however as these products were not originally designed to be delivered over the internet as a service and were limited in their ability to serve all sizes of business across many industries they failed to address many of the shortcomings of traditional business application software in addition because they were not easy to use users were hesitant to adopt these complex nonintuitive installed applications 

ondemand application services 

softwareasaservice 

the pervasiveness of the internet along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of information technology or it infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically over the internet on an outsourced basis this new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing or cloud computing while the outsourced software applications are referred to as ondemand application services 

softwareasaservice which is an ondemand application service enables businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

softwareasaservice application services contrast with the traditional enterprise software model which requires each customer to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services to implement the software application inhouse moreover traditional enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices 

  

and operating environments as a result they dedicate fewer resources to innovation and incur higher research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue than ondemand application service providers 

softwareasaservice applications are typically multitenant in nature leveraging a common infrastructure and software code among all customers with multitenancy customers benefit from access to the latest release of the application automated upgrades more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure 

we believe the shift to softwareasaservice applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multitenant infrastructure businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs of owning enterprise software as a result we believe the continued emergence of softwareasaservice applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

platformasaservice 

we believe the success of softwareasaservice applications for business users is expanding beyond packaged business applications to include the development of custom softwareasaservice applications on a technology development platform that we and others call platformasaservice platformasa service is a new paradigm we are currently evangelizing the benefits of platformasa service to customers developers and industry analysts 

custom applications are typically developed by application developers application developers include corporate it and independent software vendors isvs that develop applications for their internal organizations or to sell to customers traditionally these developers needed to purchase install test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructures to develop their applications this expensive process meant more time and resources spent maintaining their infrastructure and less time available to develop applications which eventually hinders their innovation and productivity 

platformasaservice enables corporate it developers and isvs to leverage the benefits of a multitenancy platform for developing new applications 

our solution 

we are the leader in software on demand the company’s flagship salesforce crm applications which were initially introduced in february 2000 help companies better record track manage analyze and share information regarding their sales customer service and support and marketing operations our ondemand technology platform forcecom which was introduced in 2007 allows customers and partners to customize and integrate salesforce crm applications or build entirely new ondemand applications beyond crm without having to invest in new software hardware and related infrastructure we also offer the appexchange an online directory for ondemand applications where customers can browse testdrive and install applications since we introduced the appexchange directory in 2006 more than 700 applications developed mostly by our partners have been posted to the directory 

the forcecom platform allows all of our application services to be customized to meet the specific business needs of each of our highly diverse customers substantially all of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core crm application services all of which include the customization benefits of the forcecom platform customers can also build their own application sevices on the forcecom platform or install those built on forcecom by partners from the appexchange in order for customers to install and run custom applications whether built by themselves or by our partners they must be a subscriber to our service

professional services 

we offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our ondemand application service 

consulting and implementation services 

we offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our ondemand crm application service consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration configuration and data conversion most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis for many of our small and mediumsized business customers we also offer for a fixed price certain implementation services that take up to a week to complete

technology development and operations 

technology 

we believe that our ondemand application service enables us to develop functionality and deliver it to customers more efficiently than traditional enterprise software vendors we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser without installing any software or downloading java applets or microsoft activex or net controls 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors even those that have modified their products to be accessible over the internet moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

our service is also flexible every page is dynamically rendered for each specific user including a choice of 15 languages and a number of currencies with dynamic currency conversion support in addition our service can display different views of the data based upon a number of factors including user department and area of responsibility in the company our service also allows customers to create multiple subtypes or subclasses of our business objects and tie views to each record type this customization extends to the data model of our service as our service allows customers to extend existing tables in our database as well as create new tables without actually modifying the underlying physical database schema 

we have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality in our service that operates on the online transaction processing or oltp database system to provide realtime analysis of the user’s data while users can customize any report or dashboard in the service we dynamically tune the database based upon specific attributes of the user the data model the data security layer and the specific customizations to each report or dashboard 

we have built a serviceoriented architecture or soa which allows our service to be addressable by other applications on the internet and by applications behind customers’ firewalls through our forcecom platform we allow customers and partners to insert update delete and query any of their information in our service our fulltext search engine which allows users to perform natural language queries on all the data through a browser is also exposed as a web service in addition we have mechanisms to protect our service not only from malicious abuse but from poorly written applications that put undue strain on the service each user session is encrypted and we actively monitor our system to detect intrusion by unauthorized users 

  

development 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as forcecom in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application we are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application and are able to maintain relatively low research and development expenses as compared to enterprise software vendors 

operations 

as of january 31 2008 we serve our customers and users from a single thirdparty web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states leased from equinix inc except for features added through acquisition which are temporarily served through alternate facilities the equinix facility is built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure the facility is secured by aroundtheclock guards biometric access screening and escortcontrolled access and is supported by onsite backup generators in the event of a power failure as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate backup facility located on the east coast this strategy is designed to both protect our customers’ data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted

competition 

the market for crm enterprise business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to the hosted applications market they will be a greater competitive threat 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources they may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs additionally our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance 

our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc deloitte consulting and ibm corporation as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information

employees 

as of january 31 2008 we had 2606 employees we plan to hire additional personnel particularly in customerrelated areas for the foreseeable future as we continue to experience rapid growth in our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

we currently serve our customers from a thirdparty web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states and we plan to begin to serve some customers from a thirdparty web hosting facility located on the east coast of the united states additionally we plan to add a data center outside the united states during fiscal 2009 as we continue to add capacity in our existing and future data centers we may move or transfer data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate standby facility located on the east coast features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue 

  

to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of our service that would harm our future business prospects because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers in addition our customers may authorize third party technology providers whose applications are available through our appexchange directory to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

if our ondemand application service is not widely accepted in markets where we have few customers our future growth and success will be limited 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our ondemand application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future as a result widespread acceptance of our service by companies located outside the united states or in industries where we currently have few customers is critical to our future growth and success factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are beyond our control the inability of our ondemand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business 

  

efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and cause us to incur additional liabilities 

in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory an online marketplace for ondemand applications that run on our forcecom ondemand application service platform the market for thirdparty ondemand applications and our platform is new and unproven and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us among other things the success of the appexchange will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of thirdparty technology providers to write ondemand applications that run on our platform and the willingness of enterprises large and small to purchase and deploy these applications if thirdparty technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our online application marketplace then the market for this initiative may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would affect our ability to grow our revenue given this new and unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative in addition our customers may not authorize such thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data if our customers do authorize such access we do not warrant the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing further despite contract provisions designed to protect us customers may look to us to support and warrant the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell moreover the appexchange directory and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business which may harm our business 

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for crm enterprise business applications and development platforms is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future for small business customers we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who 

  

historically have been packaged crm software vendors but who also have directly competitive ondemand crm application services offerings 

our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc deloitte consulting and ibm corporation as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result most of the revenue we report in each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed and our stock price may decline without advance notice 

due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the rate of new or renewed subscriptions falls short of our expectations 

as a result we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 

the market for our technology delivery model and ondemand application services is immature and volatile and if it develops more slowly than we expect our business could be harmed 

the market for ondemand application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market 

  

acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of ondemand application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an ondemand application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use ondemand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of ondemand application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition as a new company in this unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business 

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory a central online marketplace for ondemand applications that we host for our customers developers and partners to exchange custom ondemand applications that are built on or can integrate with our service these custom applications some of which are not crmrelated include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service 

we cannot accurately predict customer subscription renewal rates and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically 12 to 24 months and in fact some customers have elected not to renew in addition our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions or renew for shorter contract lengths we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management if these efforts are not successful our business may suffer 

our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we continue to experience a period of increasing headcount and growth in our operations to support a growing customer base which has placed and will continue to place to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base further development of our service as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively to do so we must continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed if our new hires perform poorly or if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmed to manage the expected 

  

growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional headcount and capital investments we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term if we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to execute our business plan 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions all of which could harm our business and operating results 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met 

periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues 

we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities competitive threats management changes product introductions or enhancements sales performance increases in sales headcount and other internal and external considerations in the past these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail 

  

significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have two us patents and many other us patent applications pending we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others in addition we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims or rights against their use any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others 

if we fail to develop our brands costeffectively our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand and our other brands in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable secure and useful services at competitive prices in the past our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth 

we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers particularly large enterprise customers and to manage our customer base we believe that there is significant competition for 

  

direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and may in some cases take more than a year before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded in addition we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging thirdparty resellers because of our ondemand service model the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business financial and other resources if we are unable to structure successful thirdparty channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering our growth will be inhibited 

our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners 

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers’ business needs professional services may be performed by our own staff or by a third party or a combination of the two our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together have historically represented over 20 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

additionally some of our international subscription fees are currently paid in local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies however have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries 

for example in the united states regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service 

the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service many if not most other jurisdictions including asia countries have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including for example the securities and exchange commission which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies 

  

whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

we are required to comply on an ongoing basis with the sarbanesoxley act or sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources 

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business 

we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies 

we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

to continue to execute on our growth plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services and senior sales executives we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience in the future difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they are to receive in connection with their employment volatility in the price of our stock may therefore adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees furthermore the cost to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join our company if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

  

as we acquire companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate has experienced significant fluctuations over the past fiscal year in comparison to previous years the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from the requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

the internal revenue service initiated an examination of the company’s federal income tax return for fiscal 2006 this audit may be completed within the next 12 months while it is difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular uncertain tax position management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations for example during the three months ended january 31 2008 the trading price of our common stock has ranged 

  

from a closing price of 4853 to 6499 per share factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 

if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock the price of our stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or lower their future stock price targets or estimates of our operating results our stock price could decline rapidly furthermore if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

our executive officers directors and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock 

as a result these stockholders if they act together or in a block could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues expenses results of operations and liquidity our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “risk factors” except as required by law we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors for any reason 

overview 

we are the leading provider based on revenues and market share of software on demand according to a july 2007 report by idc we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our ondemand crm application service in february 2000 

in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition we plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally hiring additional personnel particularly in customerrelated areas expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business adding to our infrastructure to support our growth and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business additionally in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 51 percent for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor 

fiscal year 

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2008 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2008 

sources of revenues 

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our ondemand application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues other revenues consist primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2008 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers 

  

typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” or sab 104 and emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” or eitf 0021 in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider a number of factors which are described in “critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below as we introduce new service offerings such as unlimited edition partner edition and salesforce sandbox we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements as a result when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting in such situations we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract approximately 8 percent and 5 percent of our total deferred revenue as of january 31 2008 and 2007 respectively related to deferred professional services revenue 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues  cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of additional data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment costs associated with website development activities allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our ondemand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our consulting services the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period for example we have obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the united states and we intend to open a data center in asia in fiscal 2009 we expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our ondemand application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in 

  

the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 

stockbased expenses  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors we account for stockbased expenses pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which we adopted on february 1 2006 sfas 123r requires that sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods these charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future 

joint venture 

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan as of january 31 2008 we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture because of this majority interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record minority interest which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results exclusive of intercompany charges through january 31 2008 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture has not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab 104 and eitf 0021 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as an arrangement that includes subscription premium support consulting or training services we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 13922000 at january 31 2008 and 5232000 at january 31 2007 such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets 

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2008 we deferred 627 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 422 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 379 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 234 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 521 million at january 31 2008 and 316 million at january 31 2007 

  

accounting for stockbased awards we account for sharebased compensation under sfas 123r we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years 

we recognized stockbased expense of 552 million or 7 percent of revenue during fiscal 2008 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2008 we had an aggregate of 2205 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 811 million during fiscal 2009 698 million during fiscal 2010 481 million during fiscal 2011 and 215 million during fiscal 2012 these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2008 and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue sharebased awards to our employees in future periods 

we grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world in certain foreign jurisdictions we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards pursuant to sfas 123r we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise as of january 31 2008 we would incur as an operating expense in excess of 50 million for these taxes if all vested awards outstanding by employees in these foreign jurisdictions were exercised this amount is based on the number of vested awards held and the market price of our common stock as of january 31 2008 the timing of when employees in these foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested awards could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period 

the impact of sfas 123r in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses additionally the application of sfas 123r requires the use of an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards

fiscal years ended january 31 2008 and 2007 

revenues total revenues were 7487 million for fiscal 2008 compared to 4971 million during the same period a year ago an increase of 2516 million or 51 percent subscription and support revenues were 6806 million or 91 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2008 compared to 4517 million or 91 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due 

  

primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 11 million as of january 31 2008 from approximately 646000 as of january 31 2007 professional services and other revenues were 681 million or 9 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2008 compared to 454 million or 9 percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers

as described above we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services the timing of these additional expenses as well as the costs related to our new data center in asia will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 

we expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 we plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our ondemand application service additionally as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized

498 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 170 million in employee related costs primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since january 31 2006 an increase of 49 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 156 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity an increase of 39 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 54 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 21 million in allocated overhead the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by 120 million we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally 

research and development  research and development expenses were 446 million or 9 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to 233 million or 8 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 213 million the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of 120 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 42 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 27 million in depreciation expense equipment and service costs and an increase of 24 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since january 31 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses were 2529 million or 51 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to 1496 million or 48 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 1033 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of 714 million in employeerelated costs 171 million in stockbased expenses 29 million in marketing advertising and event costs 15 million in partner referral fees and 92 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since january 31 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses were 843 million or 17 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to 477 million or 16 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 366 million the increase was primarily due to increases in employeerelated costs stockbased expenses infrastructurerelated costs and professional and outside service costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since january 31 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth 

operating income loss operating loss during fiscal 2007 was 36 million and included 392 million of stockbased expenses related to sfas 123r during the same period a year ago operating income was 201 million and included 34 million of stockbased expenses the increase in our revenues was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

interest income  interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances interest income was 150 million during fiscal 2007 and was 77 million during the same period a year ago the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates 

provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 98 million during fiscal 2007 compared to a benefit for income taxes of 13 million during the same period a year ago included in the fiscal 2006 13 million income tax benefit was a 72 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 

  

the provision benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for fiscal 2007 and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago 

the fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized certain nondeductible stockbased expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r and the 72 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago 

additionally the impact of adopting sfas 123r and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of sendia corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stockbased expenses and foreign losses 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2008 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 6698 million and accounts receivable of 2201 million 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2043 million during fiscal 2008 and 1112 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

net cash used in investing activities was 1027 million during fiscal 2008 and 1686 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2008 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements development of internal use software and the purchase of software licenses computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure number of offices around the world and work force additionally in march 2007 we acquired additional developed technology for 53 million in cash 

net cash provided by financing activities was 927 million during fiscal 2008 and 450 million during the same period a year ago net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 substantially consisted of 609 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and 320 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans 

as of january 31 2008 we have a total of 59 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in san francisco california new york city singapore sweden and switzerland to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through december 2015 

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

  

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures we also have longterm liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments at january 31 2008 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 

 our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

we adopted financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  “fin 48” on february 1 2007 we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above for further information see note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months 

during fiscal 2009 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances fair value measurement disclosure in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” fsp 1571 and fsp 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” fsp 1572 fsp 1571 amends sfas no 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope fsp 1572 delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 

  

2010 the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the adoption of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements however the resulting fair values calculated under sfas no 157 after adoption may be different from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of 2010 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas 160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we are currently evaluating the potential impact if any of the adoption of sfas 160 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 6698 million at january 31 2008 these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points could result in a 32 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2007 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 4125 million the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 28 million

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in periodic sec reports is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that such information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2008 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2008 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended january 31 2008 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by 

  

collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we are the leading provider based on market share of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand according to a december 2006 report by international data corporation or idc we provide a comprehensive customer relationship management or crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide

we have also begun to encourage third parties including customers and independent software vendors to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our technology platform but are sold separately from our crm service 

industry background 

the enterprise application software market 

over the last thirty years there have been several shifts in the way vendors deliver enterprise software applications in the 1970s and 1980s vendors delivered application software through centralized mainframe based systems this evolved in the 1990s to clientserver computing 

many businesses purchased built and deployed a wide range of enterprise software applications in such areas as enterprise resource planning or erp and crm businesses had no choice but to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services needed to implement the software application inhouse as a result enterprise software applications were historically available mostly to large businesses with the financial resources to make such investments 

while technology improvements brought increased processing power and application functionality intended to enable businesses to automate and improve their basic processes businesses have been challenged to realize the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

 in an attempt to address these challenges many enterprise software application vendors adapted their products to be accessible over the internet however as these products were not originally designed to be delivered over the internet as a service they failed to address these challenges in addition because they are not easy to use users were hesitant to adopt these complex nonintuitive installed applications 

ondemand application services 

the pervasiveness of the internet along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of it infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically over the internet on an outsourced basis this new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing while the outsourced software applications are referred to as ondemand application services 

ondemand application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

ondemand application services contrast with the traditional enterprise software model which requires each customer to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services to implement the software application inhouse moreover traditional enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices and operating environments and as a result dedicate fewer resources to innovation and incur higher research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue than ondemand application service providers 

  

ondemand application services also contrast with solutions offered by firstgeneration application service providers commonly referred to as asps which host thirdparty enterprise applications on behalf of their customers since these asps are deploying traditional thirdparty enterprise software applications with each customer typically running on a separate instance or copy of the software asps remain challenged by the time and expense problems associated with purchasing implementing integrating maintaining and supporting these applications additionally because asp hosting typically involves the installation of one dedicated server or set of servers to support a small number of customers asps are challenged to costeffectively scale to support a larger customer base 

we believe the shift to ondemand application services provides significant benefits businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs of owning enterprise software as a result we believe the emergence of ondemand application services will continue to bring about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

the opportunity for ondemand crm application services 

one category of enterprise software applications in which businesses have made significant investments is crm crm software is intended to enable businesses to automate three key functional areas sales customer service and support and marketing the objective of crm is to improve interactions with customers by providing a means for recording managing accessing and analyzing information regarding all aspects of a company’s interactions with its customers 

the difficulties that companies have faced in deploying and maintaining enterprise software applications in general are particularly relevant to crm despite the significant potential benefits that can be attained from crm many enterprises have failed to successfully deploy the crm software they have purchased 

we believe that traditional crm applications have generally suffered from the following challenges 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that the crm market is one of the first markets to benefit from the ondemand application services delivery model as a result of the high total cost of ownership low deployment and usage rates and poor return on investment of traditional crm software we believe that businesses are especially open to a new delivery model for crm the emergence of ondemand application services combined with the deficiencies associated 

  

with traditional crm software applications have created an opportunity for a vendor that can provide ondemand crm application services that have been specifically designed and built to be delivered over the internet

professional services 

we offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our ondemand application service 

consulting and implementation services 

we offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our ondemand crm application service consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration configuration and data conversion the majority of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis for many of our small and mediumsized business customers we also offer for a fixed price certain implementation services that take up to a week to complete

technology development and operations 

technology 

we believe that our ondemand application service enables us to develop functionality and deliver it to customers more efficiently than traditional enterprise software vendors we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser without installing any software or downloading java applets or microsoft activex or net controls 

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors even those that have modified their products to be accessible over the internet moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

our service is also flexible every page is dynamically rendered for each specific user including a choice of 14 languages and a number of currencies with dynamic currency conversion support in addition our service can display different views of the data based upon a number of factors including user department and area of responsibility in the company our service also allows customers to create multiple subtypes or subclasses of our business objects and tie views to each record type this customization extends to the data model of our service as our service allows customers to extend existing tables in our database as well as create new tables without actually modifying the underlying physical database schema 

we have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality in our service that operates on the online transaction processing or oltp database system to provide realtime analysis of the user’s data while users can customize any report or dashboard in the service we dynamically tune the database based upon specific attributes of the user the data model the data security layer and the specific customizations to each report or dashboard 

we have built a serviceoriented architecture or soa which allows our service to be addressable by other applications on the internet and by applications behind customers’ firewalls through our apex platform we allow customers and partners to insert update delete and query any of their information in our service our fulltext search engine which allows users to perform natural language queries on all the data through a browser is also exposed as a web service in addition we have mechanisms to protect our service not only from malicious abuse but from poorly written applications that put undue strain on the service each user session is encrypted and we actively monitor our system to detect intrusion by unauthorized users 

  

development 

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application and are able to maintain relatively low research and development expenses our research and development expenses were 446 million in fiscal 2007 233 million in fiscal 2006 and 98 million in fiscal 2005 

operations

competition 

the market for crm applications and enterprise business applications generally is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly or hosted by a first generation asp on the customer’s behalf and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that as enterprise software application vendors shift more of their focus to the hosted applications market particularly for crm and the small to medium sized business market these vendors will be a greater competitive threat 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 while some of our competitors offer crm applications with greater complexity than our service we believe none of them addresses all of the limitations of traditional crm applications adequately in many cases we believe crm applications with greater complexity have a higher total cost of ownership take significantly more time to implement and are harder to use than our service however many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources they may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs additionally our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance 

  

our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information

employees 

as of january 31 2007 we had 2070 employees we plan to hire additional personnel particularly in customerrelated areas for the foreseeable future as we continue to execute on our growth plan

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and industry 

if our ondemand application service is not widely accepted our operating results will be harmed 

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our ondemand application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future as a result widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future growth and success factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are beyond our control the inability of our ondemand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business 

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

  

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

as of january 31 2007 we serve our customers from a thirdparty web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements our production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate standby facility located on the east coast features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

as we continue to add data center capacity we may move or transfer data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities 

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers’ data our reputation will be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers in addition our customers may authorize third party technology providers whose applications are available through our appexchange directory access to their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty appexchange technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty appexchange technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

the market for crm applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing barriers to entry are relatively low several of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants we expect competition to intensify in the future if we fail to compete effectively our operating results will be harmed some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures if we are unable to maintain our current pricing our operating results could be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

our current principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future for small business customers we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality 

we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors but who also have directly competitive ondemand crm application services offerings our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations 

as a result we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 

our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline moreover our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 some of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future 

we have incurred significant operating losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in february 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we have begun generating profits only since fiscal 2003 as we are a relatively young company in an emerging market and with the requirement to expense stock options we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant operating losses in the future in addition we expect our costs and operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs and operating expenses we will not continue to be profitable you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance in fact in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline furthermore if our costs and operating expenses exceed our expectations our financial performance will be adversely affected 

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

the market for our technology delivery model and ondemand application services is immature and volatile and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect our business will be harmed 

the market for ondemand application services is relatively new and unproven and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of ondemand application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an ondemand application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use ondemand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of ondemand application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition as a new company in this unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business 

  

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory a central online marketplace for ondemand applications that we host for our customers developers and partners to exchange custom ondemand applications that are built on or can integrate with our service these custom applications some of which are not crmrelated include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting although we do not presently charge for use of the appexchange directory it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service 

we have limited history with our subscription model to accurately predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact some customers have elected not to do so in addition our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management if these efforts are not successful our business may suffer 

our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

we are currently experiencing a period of increasing headcount and rapid growth in our operations which has placed and will continue to place to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively to do so we must continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed if our new hires perform poorly or if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmed to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term if we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to execute our business plan 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses which have a greater rate of attrition and nonrenewal than mediumsized and large enterprise customers 

our small business customers which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees typically have shorter initial subscription periods and based on our limited experience to date have had a higher rate of attrition and nonrenewal as compared to our mediumsized and large enterprise customers if we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough our revenue could decline 

  

our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large customers 

our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends in large part on widespread acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large businesses our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful in particular because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical crm applications from one of our larger more established competitors even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service which could harm our business 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers all of which could harm our business 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met in addition larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may cause us to incur additional liabilities 

we introduced the appexchange directory in fiscal 2006 an online marketplace for ondemand applications that run on our apex ondemand application service platform the market for thirdparty ondemand applications—and our platform—is new and unproven and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us among other things the success of apex will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of thirdparty technology providers to write ondemand applications that run on our platform and the 

  

willingness of enterprises large and small to purchase and deploy these applications if thirdparty technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our online application marketplace then the market for this initiative may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would affect our ability to generate revenue given this new and unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative in addition our customers may authorize such thirdparty technology providers to access their customer data because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and thirdparty technology providers or the processing of such data by thirdparty technology providers we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing further despite contract provisions designed to protect us customers may look to us to support and warrant the thirdparty applications which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell moreover the appexchange directory and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business which may harm our business 

as we acquire companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies in the future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline 

if we fail to develop our brand costeffectively our business may suffer 

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive 

  

prices in the past our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth 

we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers particularly large enterprise customers and to manage our customer base we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and may in some cases take more than a year before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded in addition we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging thirdparty resellers because of our ondemand service model the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business financial and other resources if we are unable to structure successful thirdparty channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering our growth will be inhibited 

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together have historically represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

additionally some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in us dollars and paid in local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have us and international patent applications pending we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology in addition if any patents are issued in the future they may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims or rights against their use any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others 

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

  

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies however have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries for example regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service 

the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including the securities and exchange commission new york stock exchange and public company accounting oversight board which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

we are required to comply on an ongoing basis with the sarbanesoxley act or sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent public accountants’ audit of that assessment these requirements first became applicable to us on january 31 2006 our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources 

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

  

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business 

we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies 

we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

to continue to execute on our growth plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services and senior sales executives we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience in the future difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment volatility in the price of our stock may therefore adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees furthermore the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates require to join our company if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

we might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available 

we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 

we may be required to purchase the interest in our japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner under certain circumstances on terms that may not be favorable to us 

in some circumstances we may be required to purchase the interest of our japanese joint venture partner if we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner or if we and our partner 

  

disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture in the event we are required to purchase our partner’s interest in the joint venture we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital which could harm our financial condition 

expensing stock options will continue to adversely affect our reported results of operations 

effective february 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 as revised sharebased payment  or sfas 123r sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods as a result of implementing sfas 123r we recognized stockbased expense of 392 million or 8 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 we believe this change in accounting will continue to materially reduce our future reported results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

our tax rate in fiscal 2007 is significantly higher than in previous years the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from the new requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations for example during the year ended january 31 2007 the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a closing price of 2185 to 4400 per share further our common stock has a limited trading history factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation such as the lawsuits filed following the approximately 25 decline in our stock price on july 21 2004 which may harm our business and results of operations 

if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock the price of our stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline rapidly furthermore if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

our executive officers directors current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders acting together will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on august 6 2004 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county entitled borrelli v benioff et al against the company’s chief executive officer its chief financial officer and members of its board of directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment under state common law subsequently a substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court based on the same facts and allegations entitled johnson v benioff et al the two actions were consolidated under the caption borrelli v benioff case no cgc04433615 cal super ct sf cty on october 5 2004 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint and assert that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by making or failing to prevent salesforcecom inc and its management from making statements or omissions that potentially subject the company to liability and injury to its reputation the action seeks damages on behalf of salesforcecom in an unspecified amount among other forms of legal and equitable relief salesforcecom is named solely as a nominal defendant against which no recovery is sought the plaintiff shareholders made no demand upon the board of directors prior to filing these actions on june 15 2006 defendants filed a demurrer to the consolidated complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue the action because of their failure to make demand upon the board of directors the court overruled defendants’ demurrer on october 3 2006 defendants petitioned the california court of appeal for review of the trial court’s decision to overrule the demurrer the court of appeal denied the petition on october 12 2006 defendants filed a petition for review of that decision with the california supreme court on october 23 2006 but the petition for review was denied on january 3 2007 on december 22 2006 the trial court ordered that the lawsuit be bifurcated into two phases the first phase is a bench trial to decide the legal issues of a whether a duty to disclose internal forecasts in an ipo registration statement exists in law b if so under what circumstances this duty exists and c which party bears the burden of proof with respect to the foregoing two issues the second phase will address the remaining issues if any accordingly pursuant to the court’s order on january 19 2007 the parties simultaneously filed briefs on the three legal issues listed above simultaneous reply briefs are due on february 23 2007 and the court will hear oral argument on march 27 2007 the court ordered that all discovery be stayed unless and until the court orders otherwise to date no discovery has occurred in this case it is not possible for the company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the individual defendants if any management does not believe that the lawsuits have any merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously 

  

additionally we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities in our opinion resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

overview 

we are the leading provider based on market share of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand according to a december 2006 report by idc we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our ondemand crm application service in february 2000 

in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity we will need to among other things continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition we plan to reinvest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity upgrading our development and test data center hiring additional personnel particularly in customerrelated areas expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business adding to our infrastructure to support our growth and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business additionally in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies 

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 51 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31 2007 and 48 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our ondemand application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues other revenues consist primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although 

  

terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

cost of revenues  cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of additional data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment costs associated with website development activities allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software to date the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services including stockbased expenses the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our ondemand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our consulting services the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period for example we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services we have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the united states we expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our ondemand application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding 

  

our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including stockbased expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business international expansion and operations as a public company including the continuing cost of our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

stockbased expenses  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors as described below on february 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which requires companies to expense their stock option awards we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods these charges are significant and are reflected in our financial results 

prior to february 1 2006 we recognized stockbased expenses related to options and warrants issued to nonemployees and option grants to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees or apb 25 under apb 25 the compensation expense of stock options to employees was measured based on the difference in the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of the grant these differences occurred prior to our june 2004 initial public offering 

joint venture 

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan as of january 31 2007 we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture because of this majority interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record minority interest which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results exclusive of intercompany charges through january 31 2007 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture had not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as an arrangement that includes subscription premium support consulting or training services we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 5232000 at january 31 2007 and 1686000 at january 31 2006 such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets 

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

during fiscal 2007 we deferred 379 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 234 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 221 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 146 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 316 million at january 31 2007 and 171 million at january 31 2006 

  

accounting for stockbased awards effective february 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods prior to february 1 2006 we accounted for sharebased compensation under apb 25 

sfas 123r requires all employee sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options be recognized as expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years 

we recognized stockbased expense of 392 million during fiscal 2007 the requirement to expense stockbased awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations as of january 31 2007 we had an aggregate of 1524 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows 535 million during fiscal 2008 473 million during fiscal 2009 365 million during fiscal 2010 and 151 million during fiscal 2011 the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january 31 2007 and assumes no forfeiture activity we expect to continue to issue sharebased awards to our employees in future periods 

the impact of sfas 123r in the future is dependent upon among other things the timing of when we hire additional employees the effect of longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses additionally the application of sfas 123r requires the use of an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 

during fiscal 2007 we awarded 876303 restricted stock units to our employees we plan to continue awarding restricted stock units in the future the restricted stock units which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit have an exercise price of 0001 per share which is equal to the par value of our common stock and vest over 4 years during fiscal 2007 the fair value of the restricted units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant which ranged from 2935 to 3935 per share and compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items prior year tax exposure items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses arising from sfas 123r and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities

our gross profit during fiscal 2007 was 3782 million or 76 percent of revenues and included stockbased expenses of 55 million our operating loss was 36 million and included stockbased expenses of 392 million during the same period a year ago we generated a gross profit of 2407 million or 78 percent of revenues and had operating income of 201 million operating income during the year ended january 31 2006 also included 34 million of stockbased expense 

additionally during fiscal 2007 we reinvested our revenue growth in an effort to expand our business we incurred costs related to our data center capacity and upgrading our development and test data center additionally we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers professional services personnel to support our consulting services developers to broaden and enhance our ondemand service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business 

during fiscal 2007 we generated 1112 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 959 million during the same period a year ago at january 31 2007 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 4125 million as compared to 2968 million at january 31 2006 accounts receivable of 1287 million at january 31 2007 as compared to 761 million at january 31 2006 and deferred revenue of 2841 million at january 31 2007 as compared to 1692 million at january 31 2006 

  

on april 10 2006 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of sendia corporation a privatelyheld ondemand wireless application company based in santa monica california for 155 million in cash including acquisition costs we believe sendia’s solution will provide our customers with the increased ability to access ondemand applications via mobile handheld devices 

fiscal years ended january 31 2007 and 2006 

revenues total revenues were 4971 million for the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 3099 million during the same period a year ago an increase of 1872 million or 60 percent subscription and support revenues were 4517 million or 91 percent of total revenues for the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 2807 million or 91 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 646000 as of january 31 2007 from approximately 393000 as of january 31 2006 professional services and other revenues were 454 million or 9 percent of total revenues for the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 292 million or 9 percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers 

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 1095 million or 22 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 628 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 467 million or 74 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally 

cost of revenues  cost of revenues was 1189 million or 24 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 691 million or 22 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 498 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 170 million in employeerelated costs primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since january 31 2006 an increase of 49 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 156 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity an increase of 39 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 54 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 21 million in allocated overhead the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by 120 million we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally 

we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services the timing of these additional expenses together with the requirement to expense stock options will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues we expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008 we plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our ondemand application service 

research and development  research and development expenses were 446 million or 9 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 233 million or 8 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 213 million the increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of 120 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 42 million in stockbased expenses an increase of 27 million in depreciation expense equipment and service costs and an increase of 24 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since january 31 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses were 2529 million or 51 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 1496 million or 48 percent of total revenues during the 

  

same period a year ago an increase of 1033 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of 714 million in employeerelated costs 171 million in stockbased expenses 29 million in marketing advertising and event costs 15 million in partner referral fees and 92 million in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since january 31 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses were 843 million or 17 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to 480 million or 16 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 363 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 288 million in employeerelated costs 95 million in stockbased expenses 65 million in infrastructurerelated costs and 55 million in professional and outside service costs which were primarily offset by 137 million in increased allocated charges to nongeneral and administrative departments our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since january 31 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth 

operating income loss operating loss during the year ended january 31 2007 was 36 million and included 392 million of stockbased expenses related to sfas 123r during the same period a year ago operating income was 201 million and included 34 million of stockbased expenses the increase in our revenues was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

interest income  interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances interest income was 150 million during the year ended january 31 2007 and was 77 million during the same period a year ago the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates 

provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 98 million during the year ended january 31 2007 compared to a benefit for income taxes of 13 million during the same period a year ago included in the fiscal 2006 13 million income tax benefit was a 72 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets prior to the third quarter of last year we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 

the provision benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for the current period and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago 

the fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized certain nondeductible stockbased expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r and the 72 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago 

additionally the impact of adopting sfas 123r and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of sendia corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stockbased expenses and foreign losses see note 6 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes

lease recovery the lease recovery of 285000 which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the san francisco california office space that we abandoned in december 2001 in march 2005 we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value accordingly we recorded a 285000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space 

operating income operating income during the year ended january 31 2006 was 201 million during the same period a year ago it was 65 million the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues most of which was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

interest income  interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances during the year ended january 31 2005 interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options none of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the company and all of them repaid their loan balances by february 28 2005 interest income was 77 million during the year ended january 31 2006 and was 27 million during the same period a year ago the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the 1138 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in june 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since january 31 2005 

benefit provision for income taxes  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of 13 million during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to a provision for income taxes of 12 million during the same period a year ago included in the 13 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling 72 million prior to fiscal 2006 we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets as of january 31 2006 we had 72 million of deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

as of january 31 2006 we maintained a 418 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries 

this effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized see note 6 “income taxes” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

at january 31 2007 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 4125 million and accounts receivable of 1287 million 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1112 million during the year ended january 31 2007 and 959 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

net cash used in investing activities was 1686 million during the year ended january 31 2007 and 478 million during the same period a year ago the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended january 31 2007 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures 

  

associated with the purchase of software licenses computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force in april 2006 we acquired sendia corporation for 155 million including acquisition costs and in december 2006 we increased our ownership interest in kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom from 63 percent to 65 percent by purchasing some shares held by a minority partner for 28 million 

net cash provided by financing activities was 450 million during the year ended january 31 2007 and 158 million during the same period a year ago during the year ended january 31 2007 the 291 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and 166 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures we also have longterm liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments at january 31 2007 the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our longterm liability were as follows 

 

 our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our marketing and sales activities the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with web hosting 

  

and the continuing market acceptance of our services to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 

during fiscal 2008 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources to take these actions we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met fin 48 also provides guidance on the recognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating what impact if any the adoption of fin 48 will have on our financial position and results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” the purpose of sfas no 157 is to define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements the measurement and disclosure requirements are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we are currently assessing whether adoption of sfas no 157 will have an impact on our financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 4125 million at january 31 2007 these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points could result in a 28 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

at january 31 2006 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2968 million the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 16 million

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2007 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2007 we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our audit committee

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations 

  

include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we designed and developed our hosted service to be a lowcost easytouse application that is easy and quick to deploy customizable and can be integrated with other software applications we deliver our service through a standard web browser customers who use our ondemand crm service are able to avoid many of the expenses and complexities of traditional enterprise software implementations as a result our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs our service helps customers more effectively manage and share their sales support marketing and partner information ondemand we market our service to businesses on a subscription basis primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners as of january 31 2006 our customer base had grown to approximately 20500 worldwide and we had approximately 399000 paying subscriptions we define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customerauthorized users that have not been suspended for nonpayment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue 

  

industry background 

  

the enterprise application software market 

  

over the last thirty years there have been several shifts in the way vendors deliver enterprise software applications in the 1970s and 1980s vendors delivered application software through centralized mainframe based systems this evolved in the 1990s to clientserver computing 

  

many businesses purchased built and deployed a wide range of enterprise software applications in such areas as enterprise resource planning or erp and crm businesses had no choice but to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services needed to implement the software application inhouse as a result enterprise software applications were historically available mostly to large businesses with the financial resources to make such investments 

  

while technology improvements brought increased processing power and application functionality intended to enable businesses to automate and improve their basic processes businesses have been challenged to realize the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons including the following 

  

   

   

in an attempt to address these challenges many enterprise software application vendors adapted their products to be accessible over the internet however as these products were not originally designed to be delivered over the internet as a service they failed to address these challenges in addition because they are not easy to use users were hesitant to adopt these complex nonintuitive installed applications 

  

emergence of ondemand application services 

  

the pervasiveness of the internet along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of it infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically over the internet on an outsourced basis this new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing while the outsourced software applications are referred to as ondemand application services 

  

ondemand application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

  

we feel that the key attributes of successful ondemand application services include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

ondemand application services contrast with the traditional enterprise software model which requires each customer to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services to implement the software application inhouse moreover traditional enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices and operating environments and as a result dedicate fewer resources to innovation and incur higher research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue than ondemand application service providers 

  

ondemand application services also contrast with solutions offered by firstgeneration application service providers commonly referred to as asps which host thirdparty enterprise applications on behalf of their customers since these asps are deploying traditional thirdparty enterprise software applications with each customer typically running on a separate instance or copy of the software asps remain challenged by the time and expense problems associated with purchasing implementing integrating maintaining and supporting these applications additionally because asp hosting typically involves the installation of one dedicated server or set of servers to support a small number of customers asps are challenged to costeffectively scale to support a larger customer base 

  

we believe the shift to ondemand application services provides significant benefits businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs of owning enterprise software as a result we believe the emergence of ondemand application services will continue to bring about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services according to an april 2005 report by idc 79 of companies surveyed are now purchasing or reviewing ondemand application offerings 

  

the opportunity for ondemand crm application services 

  

one category of enterprise software applications in which businesses have made significant investments is crm crm software is intended to enable businesses to automate three key functional areas sales customer service and support and marketing the objective of crm is to improve interactions with customers by providing a means for recording managing accessing and analyzing information regarding all aspects of a company’s interactions with its customers 

  

the difficulties that companies have faced in deploying and maintaining enterprise software applications in general are particularly relevant to crm despite the significant potential benefits that can be attained from crm many enterprises have failed to successfully deploy the crm software they have purchased 

  

we believe that traditional crm applications have generally suffered from the following challenges 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that the crm market is one of the first markets to benefit from the new ondemand application services delivery model as a result of the high total cost of ownership low deployment and usage rates and poor return on investment of traditional crm software we believe that businesses are especially open to a new delivery model for crm the emergence of ondemand application services combined with the deficiencies associated with traditional crm software applications have created an opportunity for a vendor that can provide ondemand crm application services that have been specifically designed and built to be delivered over the internet 

  

our solution 

  

we are the leading provider of ondemand crm helping companies better track manage and share information regarding their sales customer service and support and marketing operations as of january 31 2006 our customer base had grown to approximately 20500 worldwide and we had approximately 399000 paying subscriptions we provide our service to businesses through our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant application architecture which allows us to serve large numbers of customers costeffectively by leveraging a single application code base

key advantages of our solution include 

  

   

   

   

additionally our service enables customers to automate sales customer service and support and marketing processes without having to make large and risky upfront investments in software hardware implementation services and additional it staff also because all upgrades are implemented by us on our servers new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately customers are not burdened or disrupted by the need to upgrade systems 

  

   

   

   

our strategy 

  

our objective is to be the leading provider of ondemand application services for businesses worldwide we want to manage more than crm data however we believe that crm still presents a significant growth opportunity key elements of our strategy include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition by continuously enhancing the functionality of our service we believe that customers will find more uses for our service and therefore purchase additional subscriptions continue to renew their existing subscriptions and upgrade to more fully featured versions such as our enterprise edition 

  

   

in continuing with our efforts to encourage the development of thirdparty applications that will benefit our customers in september 2005 we introduced the appexchange directory an online marketplace that we host for our customers developers and partners to exchange custom applications that are built on and can integrate with our service 

  

the salesforcecom service 

  

we provide a comprehensive array of ondemand crm and business application services which enable customers and subscribers to systematically record store and act upon business data and to help businesses manage customer accounts track sales leads evaluate marketing campaigns and provide postsales service we also enable companies to generate reports and summaries of this data and share them with authorized individuals across functional areas our crm services mainly focus on the following areas 

  

   

   

   

   

in september 2005 we introduced the appexchange directory which is an ondemand applicationsharing service and an ondemand platform that customers can leverage to build and deploy their own custom applications to extend salesforce beyond crm services appexchange provides a way to browse testdrive share and install applications developed on our ondemand appexchange platform partners developers and anyone else who chooses to participate can offer their applications on the appexchange directory this directory gives our users an easy way to find and install applications to expand their use of the appexchange platform to new areas of customer relationship management we currently do not charge users or partners a fee or royalty for applications in the directory 

  

as of january 31 2006 we offered three principal editions of our service for a fee team edition professional edition and enterprise edition we derived approximately 90 percent or more of our revenues in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 from subscriptions to and support for our service 

  

   

   

   

 b sophisticated multidivisional sharing and permissions such as profilebased departmental security and sharing 

c workflow and business process control such as workflow automation tasks 

d enterprise customization and integration tools that can support largescale deployments such appexchange and web service api’s for backoffice integration that enables companies to readily integrate salesforce with erp applications and other data sources 

  

with enterprise edition customers also have the maximum flexibility and control to fully extend and customize their salesforcecom application by adding more custom applications custom tabs andor custom objects 

  

each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services which are available 12 hours a day five days a week with a 48hour response time guarantee for advanced customers with more complex business needs we provide additional levels of feebased customer support 

  

in addition to the three editions we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional addon subscriptions to better meet different customers’ individual needs some examples include 

  

   

   

   

as part of our marketing programs we also offer a personal edition service which includes a contact management database and several other features that are useful to individual sales representatives and others who need a centralized way to organize contact data and access that data over the internet it is intended for use by a single user and is currently available at no charge in addition we offer a service called developer edition currently at no charge to developers and others interested in building applications on our appexchange platform 

  

our customers can customize and integrate our application with other software applications in a variety of ways for example through our appexchange api a customer can integrate our service with multiple erp systems including oracle financial software and siebel customer support software and an isv can integrate a customer’s sales force automation and content management data with the professional services management system the isv built additionally through our appexchange builder a customer can tailor the features of the service to meet their business requirements or create new ondemand applications through a pointandclick interface and without the use of significant it resources or consultants 

  

in june 2005 we launched appexchange os previously called multiforce which is an extension of the capabilities of appexchange builder through appexchange os our subscribers can multitask between 

  

multiple ondemand applications all running in the same service environment with a single click appexchange os extends the range of custom applications beyond crm 

  

we currently do not charge users a fee or royalty on the appexchange directory appexchange os appexchange builder appexchange api or applications developed with the appexchange platform 

  

professional services 

  

we offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our ondemand application service 

  

consulting and implementation services 

  

we offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our ondemand crm application service consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service implementation services include systems integration configuration and data conversion the majority of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis for many of our small and mediumsized business customers we also offer for a fixed price certain implementation services that take up to a week to complete 

  

training

we bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person per class basis the majority of our online educational classes are available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service we also assist customers in developing and delivering a customized education program for their employees the majority of these custom training engagements are billed on a time and materials basis 

  

technology development and operations 

  

technology 

  

we believe that our ondemand application service enables us to develop functionality and deliver it to customers more efficiently than traditional enterprise software vendors we do not provide software that must be written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

  

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser without installing any software or downloading java applets or microsoft activex or net controls 

  

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors even those that have modified their products to be accessible over the internet moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

  

our service is also flexible every page is dynamically rendered for each specific user including a choice of 12 languages and a number of currencies with dynamic currency conversion support in addition our service can display different views of the data based upon a number of factors including user department and area of responsibility in the company our service also allows customers to create multiple subtypes or subclasses of our business objects and tie views to each record type this customization extends to the data model of our service as our service allows customers to extend existing tables in our database as well as create new tables without actually modifying the underlying physical database schema 

  

we have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality in our service that operates on the online transaction processing or oltp database system to provide realtime analysis of the user’s data while users can customize any report or dashboard in the service we dynamically tune the database based upon specific attributes of the user the data model the data security layer and the specific customizations to each report or dashboard 

  

we have built a serviceoriented architecture or soa which allows our service to be addressable by other applications on the internet and by applications behind customers’ firewalls through our appexchange api platform we allow customers and partners to insert update delete and query any of their information in our service our fulltext search engine which allows users to perform natural language queries on all the data through a browser is also exposed as a web service in addition we have mechanisms to protect our service not only from malicious abuse but from poorly written applications that put undue strain on the service each user session is encrypted and we actively monitor our system to detect intrusion by unauthorized users 

  

development 

  

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application and are able to maintain relatively low research and development expenses our research and development expenses were 233 million in fiscal 2006 98 million in fiscal 2005 and 70 million in fiscal 2004

competition 

  

the market for crm applications and enterprise business applications generally is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly or hosted by a first generation asp on the customer’s behalf and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future our current principal competitors include 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe that as enterprise software application vendors shift more of their focus to the hosted applications market particularly for crm and the small to medium sized business market these vendors will be a greater competitive threat 

  

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while some of our competitors offer crm applications with greater complexity than our service we believe none of them addresses all of the limitations of traditional crm applications adequately in many cases we believe crm applications with greater complexity have a higher total cost of ownership take significantly more time to implement and are harder to use than our service however many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources they may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs additionally our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance 

  

our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

if our ondemand application service is not widely accepted our operating results will be harmed 

  

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our ondemand application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future as a result widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future growth and success factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

many of these factors are beyond our control the inability of our ondemand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business 

  

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

  

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future in addition our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

  

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

  

as of january 31 2006 we serve all of our customers from a single thirdparty web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states operated by equinix inc as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near realtime in a separate standby equinix facility located on the east coast we do not control the operation of any of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition to the west coast and east coast facilities we have an agreement with sungard data systems a provider of availability services to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us with access to hardware software and internet connectivity in the event the web hosting facilities become unavailable even with the disaster recovery arrangements our service could be interrupted 

  

as we continue to add data center capacity we may move or transfer data despite precautions taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service further any damage to or failure of our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

  

we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

  

we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue 

  

to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

  

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities 

  

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers’ data our reputation will be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

  

the market for crm applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing barriers to entry are relatively low several of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants we expect competition to intensify in the future if we fail to compete effectively our operating results will be harmed some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures if we are unable to maintain our current pricing our operating results could be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

  

our current principal competitors include 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future for small business customers we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality 

  

we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors but who also have directly competitive ondemand crm application services offerings such as siebel systems’ siebel crm ondemand which was acquired by oracle our 

  

professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

  

many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

  

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

  

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations 

  

as a result we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 

  

our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

  

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

some of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future 

  

we incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in february 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we have begun generating profits only since fiscal 2003 as we are a relatively young company in an emerging market and with the new requirement to begin expensing stock options in fiscal 2007 we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may again incur significant operating losses in the future in addition we expect our costs and operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs and operating expenses we will not continue to be profitable you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance in fact in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline furthermore if our costs and operating expenses exceed our expectations our financial performance will be adversely affected 

  

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

  

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

the market for our technology delivery model and ondemand application services is immature and volatile and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect our business will be harmed 

  

the market for ondemand application services is relatively new and unproven and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of ondemand application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel 

  

and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an ondemand application service furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use ondemand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of ondemand application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition as a new company in this unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business 

  

our success also depends on the willingness of thirdparty developers to build applications that are complementary to our service without the development of these applications both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory a central online marketplace for ondemand applications that we host for our customers developers and partners to exchange custom ondemand applications that are built on or can integrate with our service these custom applications some of which are not crmrelated include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting although we do not presently charge for use of the appexchange directory it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service 

  

we do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

  

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact some customers have elected not to do so in addition our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

  

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management if these efforts are not successful our business may suffer 

  

our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

  

we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and will continue to place to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively to do so we must continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed if our new hires perform poorly or if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmed to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any 

  

future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term if we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to execute our business plan 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses which have a greater rate of attrition and nonrenewal than mediumsized and large enterprise customers 

  

our small business customers which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees typically have shorter initial subscription periods and based on our limited experience to date have had a higher rate of attrition and nonrenewal as compared to our mediumsized and large enterprise customers if we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough our revenue could decline 

  

our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large customers 

  

our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends in large part on widespread acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large businesses our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful in particular because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical crm applications from one of our larger more established competitors even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service which could harm our business 

  

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers all of which could harm our business 

  

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met in addition larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable 

  

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

  

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and 

  

development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

  

any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed 

  

to date we have focused our business on providing ondemand application services for the crm market but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets in addition we recently launched the appexchange directory an online marketplace for ondemand applications running on our ondemand application service platform however any efforts to expand beyond the crm market may never result in significant revenue growth for us in addition efforts to expand our ondemand application service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business which may harm our business 

  

if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock 

  

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies in the future through january 31 2006 we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock further if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline 

  

if we fail to develop our brand costeffectively our business may suffer 

  

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices in the past our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense brand promotion activities 

  

may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

  

failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth 

  

we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers particularly large enterprise customers and to manage our customer base we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and may in some cases take more than a year before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded in addition we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging thirdparty resellers because of our ondemand service model the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business financial and other resources if we are unable to structure successful thirdparty channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering our growth will be inhibited 

  

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

  

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

additionally some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in us dollars and paid in local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business 

  

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have us and international patent applications pending we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology in addition if any patents are issued in the future they may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

  

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

  

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

  

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims or rights against their use any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others 

  

we may be required to purchase the interest in our japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner under certain circumstances on terms that may not be favorable to us 

  

in some circumstances we may be required to purchase the interest of our japanese joint venture partner if we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture in the event we are required to purchase our partner’s interest in the joint venture we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital which could harm our financial condition although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase were it to be required are not predictable if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing which occurred in september 2003 the buyout price could be as much as approximately 130 million 

  

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

  

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and 

  

restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

  

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

  

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies however have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries for example regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service 

  

the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service 

  

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

  

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

  

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including the securities and exchange commission new york stock exchange and public company accounting oversight board that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with these new regulations most notably the sarbanesoxley act or sox have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

  

we are required to comply on an ongoing basis with the sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent public accountants’ audit of that assessment these requirements first became applicable to us on january 31 2006 our efforts to comply with the sox requirements has required and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources 

  

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

  

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

  

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly marc benioff our chief executive officer and chairman of the board steve cakebread our chief financial officer jim steele our president of worldwide sales and distribution parker harris our executive vice president of technology ken juster our executive vice president of law policy and corporate strategy and john freeland our president of worldwide operations we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

  

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

  

to continue to execute on our growth plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services and senior sales executives we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience in the future difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment volatility in the price of our stock may therefore adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees furthermore the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

  

we might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available 

  

we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 

  

changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our reported results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options the pro forma disclosures that the fasb previously permitted 

  

will no longer be an alternative to the financial statement recognition of the expense we will adopt this new accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  on a prospective basis beginning on february 1 2006 which is the start of our fiscal 2007 we believe this change in accounting will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions 

  

we expect our tax rate in fiscal 2007 to be significantly higher than in previous years the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates the tax accounting for option activities pursuant to the new requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

  

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations further our common stock has a limited trading history factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation such as the lawsuits following the approximately 25 decline in our stock price on july 21 2004 which may harm our business and results of operations 

  

if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock the price of our stock could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline rapidly furthermore if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

  

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

  

our executive officers directors current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders acting together will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing sales professional services and development occupy in excess of 200000 square feet in san francisco california under leases that expire at various times through june 2013 we also lease space in various locations throughout the united states for local sales and professional services personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel 

  

we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future see note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our lease commitments if we require additional space we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable commercially reasonable terms

on august 6 2004 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county entitled borrelli v benioff et al  against the company’s chief executive officer its chief financial officer and members of its board of directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment under state common law subsequently a substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court based on the same facts and allegations entitled johnson v benioff et al the two actions were consolidated under the caption borrelli v benioff  case no cgc04433615 cal super ct sf cty on october 5 2004 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint which is based upon the same facts and circumstances as alleged in the shareholder class action discussed above and asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by making or failing to prevent salesforcecom inc and its management from making statements or omissions that potentially subject the company to liability and injury to its reputation the action seeks damages on behalf of salesforcecom in an unspecified amount among other forms of legal and equitable relief salesforcecom is named solely as a nominal defendant against which no recovery is sought the plaintiff shareholders made no demand upon the board of directors prior to filing these actions the deadline for defendants to respond to the consolidated complaint has been extended repeatedly by agreement of the parties and is now set for june 15 2006 during this time no discovery or other proceedings have occurred in this case the derivative action is still in the preliminary stages and it is not possible for the company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the individual defendants if any management does not believe that the lawsuits have any merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously 

  

additionally we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities in our opinion resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues expenses results of operations and liquidity our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “risk factors which may impact future operating results” we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors 

  

overview 

  

we are the leading provider based on market share of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand according to an august 2005 report by idc we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 

  

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our ondemand crm application service in february 2000 

  

in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions we plan to reinvest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center hiring additional personnel particularly in customerrelated areas expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business adding to our infrastructure to support our growth and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business additionally in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering we may also in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies 

  

as our revenues increase we expect marketing and sales costs which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 55 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor 

  

fiscal year 

  

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2006 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2006 

  

sources of revenues 

  

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our ondemand application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues other revenues consist primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006 and 90 percent during the same period a year ago subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2006 and 2005 

  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

  

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

  

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

  

cost of revenues  cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support the costs of additional data center capacity depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment costs associated with website development activities allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software to date the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our ondemand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 

  

to the extent that our customer base grows we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our consulting services the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period for example we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services we have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the united states we expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant 

  

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses the costs of upgrading our new development and test data center and allocated overhead we have 

  

historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our ondemand application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

  

we recently upgraded our new development and test data center we expect the annual cost of this data center to be significant 

  

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

  

as our revenues increase we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business international expansion and operations as a public company including the cost of our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

stockbased expenses  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to options and warrants issued to nonemployees option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services these charges have been significant and are reflected in our historical financial results these amounts do not include the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options which we will adopt at the start of fiscal 2007 

  

joint venture 

  

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan as of january 31 2006 we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture because of this majority interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record minority interest which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results exclusive of intercompany charges through january 31 2006 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture had not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 

  

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

  

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

  

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables we allocate the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 

  

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 1686000 at january 31 2006 and 874000 at january 31 2005 

  

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the 

  

commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

  

during fiscal 2006 we deferred 221 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 146 million to sales expense during the same period a year ago we deferred 140 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 156 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 171 million at january 31 2006 and 96 million at january 31 2005 

  

accounting for stockbased awards we recorded deferred stockbased compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant we have elected not to record stockbased compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock in june 2004 our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors including but not limited to our operating and financial performance private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm the fair value of our common stock is now determined by the trading price of our stock on the new york stock exchange 

  

we amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the fouryear vesting period of the underlying option awards as of january 31 2006 we had an aggregate of 25 million of deferred stockbased compensation remaining to be amortized 

  

on february 1 2006 which is the start of our fiscal 2007 we will begin to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r see recent accounting pronouncement below for further discussion we believe that the adoption of sfas 123r will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations 

  

in the past we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to nonemployees for these options and warrants we recognize stockbased compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the blackscholes optionpricing model as of january 31 2006 we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to nonemployees except for options for 50000 shares of our common stock all of which will fully vest by july 2007 and have an exercise price of 250 per share 

  

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax expense or benefit for unusual items tax exposure items or adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 

  

prior to fiscal 2006 we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets during fiscal 2006 we recorded an income tax benefit of 13 million which included a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets the company continues to maintain a 418 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity which was approximately 400 million of the total valuation allowance as of january 31 2006 will be recorded to additional paidin capital

revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 were 3099 million an increase of 76 percent over the same period a year ago the total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 399000 as of january 31 2006 from approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005

during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 68 million by reducing our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets this determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that we expect to realize particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the united states 

  

additionally during fiscal 2006 we incurred substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business we incurred costs related to adding data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center additionally we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the penetration within our existing customer base professional services personnel to support our consulting services and developers to broaden and enhance our ondemand service 

  

during the year ended january 31 2006 we generated 959 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 559 million during the same period a year ago at january 31 2006 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 2968 million as compared to 2059 million at january 31 2005 accounts receivable of 761 million at january 31 2006 as compared to 489 million at january 31 2005 and deferred revenue of 1692 million at january 31 2006 as compared to 959 million at january 31 2005 

  

fiscal years ended january 31 2006 and 2005 

  

revenues total revenues were 3099 million for the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 1764 million during the same period a year ago an increase of 1335 million or 76 percent subscription and support 

  

revenues were 2807 million or 91 percent of total revenues for the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 1580 million or 90 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 399000 as of january 31 2006 from approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005 professional services and other revenues were 292 million or 9 percent of total revenues for the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 184 million or 10 percent of total revenues for the same period a year ago the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers 

  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 628 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 355 million or 20 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 273 million or 77 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities 

  

cost of revenues  cost of revenues was 691 million or 22 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 335 million or 19 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 356 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 146 million in employeerelated costs primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since january 31 2005 an increase of 116 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity an increase of 15 million in depreciation and amortization expenses an increase of 33 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of 43 million in allocated overhead charges the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended january 31 2006 by 55 million we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded 

  

as described above we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services the timing of these additional expenses together with the requirement to expense stock options beginning in fiscal 2007 will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues we believe that our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will approximate recent percentages exclusive of the new requirement to expense stock options 

  

research and development  research and development expenses were 233 million or 8 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 98 million or 5 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 135 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 77 million in employeerelated costs an increase of 36 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a 16 million increase in allocated overhead charges we increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since january 31 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies during the year ended january 31 2006 we capitalized 14 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service 

  

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses were 1496 million or 48 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 963 million or 55 percent of total revenues during the same period a year ago an increase of 533 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 379 million in employeerelated costs 50 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings advertising and events and a 91 million increase in allocated overhead our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since january 31 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses were 480 million or 16 percent of total revenues during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to 303 million or 17 percent of total revenues 

  

during the same period a year ago an increase of 177 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 222 million in employeerelated costs 41 million in professional and outside service costs and 45 million in infrastructurerelated costs which were offset by 150 million in increased allocated charges to nongeneral and administrative departments our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since january 31 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth 

  

lease recovery the lease recovery of 285000 which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the san francisco california office space that we abandoned in december 2001 in march 2005 we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value accordingly we recorded a 285000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space 

  

operating income operating income during the year ended january 31 2006 was 201 million during the same period a year ago it was 65 million the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues most of which was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

  

interest income  interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances during the year ended january 31 2005 interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options none of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the company and all of them repaid their loan balances by february 28 2005 interest income was 77 million during the year ended january 31 2006 and was 27 million during the same period a year ago the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the 1138 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in june 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since january 31 2005 

  

benefit provision for income taxes  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of 13 million during the year ended january 31 2006 compared to a provision for income taxes of 12 million during the same period a year ago included in the 13 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling 72 million prior to fiscal 2006 we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets as of january 31 2006 we had 72 million of deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

as of the same date the company continues to maintain a 418 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity which was approximately 400 million of the total valuation allowance as of january 31 2006 will be recorded to additional paidincapital to realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign operations pretax income in those jurisdictions must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized historic profits in those jurisdictions have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date 

  

without the reduction in our valuation allowance the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 20 percent this effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized 

  

we currently believe that our fiscal 2007 effective tax rate will be significantly higher than in fiscal 2006 our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of fullyear income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction and the impact of the new accounting requirement to expense stock options the estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items these actual results could vary from those projected

revenues total revenues were 1764 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 960 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of 804 million or 84 percent subscription and support revenues were 1580 million or 90 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2005 compared to 858 million or 89 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005 from approximately 127000 as of january 31 2004 professional services and other revenues were 184 million or 10 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2005 compared to 102 million or 11 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2004 the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers

the increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers 

  

research and development  research and development expenses were 98 million or 5 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 70 million or 7 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 28 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs of 23 million and an increase of 04 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since january 31 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies

outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the united states 

  

lease recovery the lease recovery of 34 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the san francisco california office space that we abandoned in december 2001 in august 2003 we entered into an agreement releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant accordingly we recorded a 34 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space 

  

operating income operating income during fiscal 2005 was 65 million during fiscal 2004 it was 37 million substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues most of which was reinvested in an effort to expand our business

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at january 31 2006 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2968 million and accounts receivable of 761 million 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 959 million during the year ended january 31 2006 and 559 million during the same period a year ago the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 478 million during the year ended january 31 2006 and 1492 million during the same period a year ago which included the investment of most of the proceeds from our initial public offering in june 2004 the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended january 31 2006 primarily related to the changes in restricted cash balances and marketable securities and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of software licenses computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force 

  

in february 2005 we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of 88 million which included the cost for support for the first year of the license agreement additionally we obtained additional data center capacity and we upgraded our new development and test data center for these data center resources our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for the facilities and computer equipment and contracts for certain services 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 158 million during the year ended january 31 2006 and 1189 million during the same period a year ago in june 2004 we completed the sale of 115 million shares of common stock during our initial public offering the net proceeds from the initial public offering were 1138 million during the year ended january 31 2006 the 157 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and the 727000 of proceeds from the collection of notes receivable from shareholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 

  

as of january 31 2006 we have a total of 34 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in san francisco california switzerland and singapore none of these letters of credit are collateralized to date no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit which renew annually and mature at various dates through december 2010 

  

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

  

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and colocation facilities for additional data center capacity and the new development and test data center and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures we also have longterm liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments at january 31 2006 the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our longterm liability were as follows 

  

   

our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

  

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our marketing and sales activities the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 

  

during fiscal 2007 we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses services or technologies while we believe we have sufficient financial resources we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

  

recent accounting pronouncement 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r on february 1 2006 which is the start of our next fiscal year 

  

we believe that the adoption of sfas 123r will materially reduce our reported results of operations the full impact is dependent upon among other things the timing of when additional employees that we plan to hire commence employment the outcome of our current assessment of different longterm incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees the total number of stock awards granted the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stockbased expenses had we adopted sfas 123r in prior periods the total stockbased expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the pro forma impact of expensing options as described in note 1 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

additionally sfas 123r requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows we currently classify these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities these benefits totaled 3662000 during the year ended january 31 2006 and 798000 for the comparable period a year ago 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and japanese yen we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period additionally by policy we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2968 million at january 31 2006 these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings the cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points could result in a 16 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

  

at january 31 2005 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2059 million the fixedincome portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk changes in interest rates of 100basis points would have resulted in market value changes of 16 million

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2006 based on the guidelines established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all 

  

control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

industry background 

  

the enterprise application software market 

  

advances in computing and communications technology have enabled businesses to automate and improve their basic business processes many businesses have purchased built and deployed a wide range of enterprise 

  

software applications in such areas as enterprise resource planning or erp and crm while technology improvements have brought increased processing power and functionality to enterprise software applications businesses have been challenged to realize the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons including the following 

  

   

   

in an attempt to address these challenges many enterprise software application vendors have adapted their products to be accessible over the internet however as these products were not originally designed to be delivered over the internet as a service they have failed to address these challenges in addition because they are not easy to use users have been hesitant to adopt these complex nonintuitive installed applications 

  

emergence of ondemand application services 

  

the pervasiveness of the internet along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of it infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically on an outsourced basis this new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing while the outsourced software applications are referred to as ondemand application services ondemand application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for and delivered over the internet on an asneeded basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage thirdparty software inhouse 

  

we feel that the key attributes of successful ondemand application services include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

ondemand application services contrast with the traditional enterprise software model which requires each customer to install configure manage and maintain the hardware software and network services to implement the software application inhouse enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices and operating environments these services also contrast with solutions offered by firstgeneration application service providers commonly referred to as asps which host thirdparty enterprise applications on behalf of their customers since these asps are deploying traditional thirdparty software applications with each customer typically running on a separate 

  

instance or copy of the software asps remain challenged by the time and expense problems associated with purchasing implementing integrating maintaining and supporting these applications additionally because asp hosting typically involves the installation of one dedicated server or set of servers to support a small number of customers asps are challenged to costeffectively scale to support a larger customer base 

  

we believe the shift to ondemand application services provides significant benefits by reducing the risks and lowering the costs of purchasing and deploying information technology resources managing software and hardware upgrades and hiring expensive it personnel to maintain applications as a result we believe the emergence of ondemand application services will bring about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services 

  

the opportunity for ondemand crm application services 

  

one category of enterprise software applications in which businesses have made significant investments is crm crm software is intended to enable businesses to automate three key functional areas sales customer service and support and marketing the objective of crm is to improve interactions with customers by providing a means for recording managing accessing and analyzing information regarding all aspects of a company’s interactions with its customers 

  

the difficulties that companies have faced in deploying and maintaining enterprise software applications in general are particularly relevant to crm despite the significant potential benefits that can be attained from crm many enterprises have failed to successfully deploy the crm software they have purchased 

  

according to a june 2003 report by amr research referencing a december 2002 study 12 percent of crm projects failed to ever be implemented usually for technical reasons an additional 47 percent of projects had significant enduser adoption problems even though the projects were successful from a technical implementation standpoint finally another 25 percent of projects met technical and user standards but did not provide value because they were either only as good as the replaced systems or the benefits were difficult to define 

  

we believe that traditional crm applications have generally suffered from the following challenges 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe that the crm market is one of the first markets to benefit from the new ondemand application services delivery model as a result of the high total cost of ownership low deployment and usage rates and poor return on investment of traditional crm software we believe that businesses are especially open to a new 

  

delivery model for crm the emergence of ondemand application services combined with the deficiencies associated with traditional crm software applications have created an opportunity for a vendor that can provide ondemand crm application services that have been specifically designed and built to be delivered over the internet

we also offer wireless functionality that enables access to a subset of a user’s data through a variety of devices including the rim blackberry pocket pc and palm operating systembased wireless devices and wapenabled mobile phones our wireless functionality permits interaction with our service both through freeform text queries and through a graphical user interface

technology development and operations 

  

technology 

  

we believe that our ondemand application service enables us to develop functionality and deliver it to customers more efficiently than traditional enterprise software vendors we do not provide software that must be 

  

written to different hardware operating system and database platforms or that depends upon a customer’s unique systems environment rather we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers performance functional depth and usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction 

  

we built our service as a highly scalable multitenant application written in java and oracle plsql we use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software including database software from oracle corporation to provide our service the application server is custombuilt and runs on a lightweight java servlet and java server pages engine we have custombuilt core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment allowing us to continue to scale our service we have combined a stateless environment in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers with an advanced data caching layer our customers can access the service through any web browser without installing any software or downloading java applets or microsoft activex or net controls 

  

our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases as a result we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base in addition because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors even those that have modified their products to be accessible over the internet moreover we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications 

  

our service is also flexible every page is dynamically rendered for each specific user including a choice of 11 languages and a number of currencies with dynamic currency conversion support in addition our service can display different views of the data based upon a number of factors including user department and area of responsibility in the company our service also allows customers to create multiple subtypes or subclasses of our business objects and tie views to each record type this customization extends to the data model of our service as our service allows customers to extend existing tables in our database as well as create new tables without actually modifying the underlying physical database schema 

  

we have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality in our service that operates on the online transaction processing or oltp database system to provide realtime analysis of the user’s data while users can customize any report or dashboard in the service we dynamically tune the database based upon specific attributes of the user the data model the data security layer and the specific customizations to each report or dashboard 

  

we have built a serviceoriented architecture or soa which allows our service to be addressable by other applications on the internet and by applications behind customers’ firewalls through our sforce platform we allow customers and partners to insert update delete and query any of their information in our service our fulltext search engine which allows users to perform natural language queries on all the data through a browser is also exposed as a web service in addition we have mechanisms to protect our service not only from malicious abuse but also from poorly written applications that put undue strain on the service each user session is encrypted and we actively monitor our system to detect intrusion by unauthorized users 

  

development 

  

our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services in addition from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources because of our common multitenant application architecture we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application and are 

  

able to maintain relatively low research and development expenses our research and development expenses were 98 million in fiscal 2005 70 million in fiscal 2004 and 46 million in fiscal 2003 

  

operations 

  

we serve all of our customers and users from a single thirdparty web hosting facility located in sunnyvale california operated by qwest communications international inc the facility is designed to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 80 on the richter scale is secured by aroundtheclock guards biometric access screening and escortcontrolled access and is supported by onsite backup generators in the event of a power failure our agreement with qwest provides for qwest to supply space in its secure facility as well as high bandwidth internet access and runs through the end of february 2006 we regularly rotate tapes of customer data out of the facility and store them in a secure location in the event of data loss at the facility 

  

we continuously monitor the performance of our service the monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles automated load distribution tools and various selfdiagnostic tools and programs we have entered into service level agreements with a small number of our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability 

  

currently we have an agreement with sungard data systems a provider of availability services to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide access to hardware software and internet connectivity in the event the qwest facility becomes unavailable even with this disaster recovery arrangement however our service would be interrupted during the transition the arrangement with sungard serves as our primary backup facility and is designed to support our service for all customers we are in the process of evaluating additional technology solutions and data center requirements for both improved business continuity and future expansion these solutions would be designed to minimize the interruption during any transition to a remote disaster recovery facility

competition 

  

the market for crm applications and enterprise business applications generally is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software whose software is installed by the customer directly or hosted by a first generation asp on the customer’s behalf and companies offering ondemand crm applications we also compete with internally developed applications and face or expect to face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future our current principal competitors include 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while some of our competitors offer crm applications with greater complexity than our service we believe none of them addresses all of the limitations of traditional crm applications adequately in many cases we believe crm applications with greater complexity have a higher total cost of ownership take significantly more time to implement and are harder to use than our service however many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories and significantly greater resources they may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs additionally our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance 

  

our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation our expectations regarding revenues expenses and results of operations our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “risk factors which may impact future operating results” we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or our risk factors 

  

overview 

  

we are the leading provider based on market share of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand according to a march 2004 report by forrester research inc we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 

  

we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our ondemand crm application service in february 2000 

  

in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions we define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customerauthorized users that have not been suspended for nonpayment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue the number of our paying subscribers increased from approximately 30000 as of february 1 2001 to approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005 we plan to reinvest our revenues for the foreseeable future by hiring additional personnel particularly in marketing and sales expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies obtaining additional business continuity services additional data center capacity and a separate development and test data center expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business adding to our infrastructure to support our growth and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business 

  

we expect marketing and sales costs which were 55 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2005 and 57 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor 

  

fiscal year 

  

our fiscal year ends on january 31 references to fiscal 2005 for example refer to the fiscal year ended january 31 2005 

  

sources of revenues 

  

we derive our revenues from two sources 1 subscription revenues which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our ondemand application service and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee and 2 related professional services and other revenues other revenues consist primarily of training fees subscription and support revenues accounted for 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005 and 89 percent during fiscal 2004 subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service none of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months although terms range from one to 60 months our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met in general we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 

  

professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis we also offer a number of classes on implementing using and administering our service that are billed on a per person per class basis our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

  

cost of revenues and operating expenses 

  

cost of revenues  cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment costs associated with website development activities allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software to date the expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount as such general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employeerelated costs associated with these services the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our ondemand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing consulting services 

  

to the extent that our customer base grows we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our consulting services the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in a particular quarterly period for example we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services additionally we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity we currently expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006 we currently expect the annual cost of these services to be approximately 70 million 

  

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our ondemand application service our proprietary scalable and secure multitenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application as a result we do not have to maintain multiple versions which enables us to 

  

have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies we expect that in the future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

  

we are also in the process of obtaining a development and test data center which we currently expect will be in place by july 2005 we expect the annual cost of this data center to be approximately 40 million 

  

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff including commissions payments to partners marketing programs and allocated overhead marketing programs consist of advertising events corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 

  

as our revenues increase we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events we expect that in the future marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive finance and accounting human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees other corporate expenses and allocated overhead we expect that in the future general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business international expansion and operations as a public company 

  

stockbased expenses  our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stockbased expenses related to options and warrants issued to nonemployees option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services these charges have been significant and are reflected in the historical financial results excluding the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options we expect stockbased expenses to be between 30 to 40 million in fiscal 2006 

  

joint venture 

  

in december 2000 we established a japanese joint venture kabushiki kaisha salesforcecom with sunbridge inc a japanese corporation to assist us with our sales efforts in japan as of january 31 2005 we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture because of this majority interest we consolidate the venture’s financial results which are reflected in each revenue cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations we then record minority interest which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results through january 31 2005 the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture had not been significant while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” on august 1 2003 we adopted emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

  

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the customer 3 the collection of our fees is probable and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract as part of their subscription agreements customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted once delivery occurs we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

  

consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable when accounted for separately consulting revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 

  

in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements the nature of the consulting services the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract additionally in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 874000 at january 31 2005 and 32000 at january 31 2004 

  

accounting for deferred commissions we defer commission payments to our direct sales force the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers which are typically 12 to 24 months the commission payments which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

  

during fiscal 2005 we deferred 140 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 156 million to sales expense during fiscal 2004 we deferred 163 million of commission expenditures and we amortized 86 million to sales expense deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled and 96 million at january 31 2005 and 112 million at january 31 2004 

  

we assess the commission plans for our sales representatives annually the impact of any changes to the commission plans will have an effect on the growth of the deferred commission asset balance during fiscal 2005 we paid our sales representatives upfront commissions for the first two years of the noncancelable subscription contracts in previous years we paid upfront commissions on the entire value of the noncancelable subscription contracts which had terms ranging up to 5 years 

  

accounting for stockbased awards we recorded deferred stockbased compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors including but not limited to our operating and financial performance private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm following our initial public offering the fair value of our common stock is determined by the trading price of such stock on the new york stock exchange 

  

we amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the fouryear vesting period of the underlying option awards as of january 31 2005 we had an aggregate of 59 million of deferred stockbased compensation remaining to be amortized we currently expect this deferred stockbased compensation balance to be amortized as follows 30 million during fiscal 2006 20 million during fiscal 2007 08 million during fiscal 2008 and 100000 during fiscal 2009 we have elected not to record stockbased compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 

  

beginning on august 1 2005 which is the start of our third quarter in fiscal 2006 we will begin to prospectively recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r see recent accounting pronouncement below for further discussion we are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

  

in the past we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to nonemployees for these options and warrants we recognize stockbased compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the blackscholes optionpricing model as of january 31 2005 we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to nonemployees except for options for 50000 shares of our common stock which will fully vest by july 2007 and have an exercise price of 250 per share at january 31 2005 one of the assumptions in the blackscholes computation is an expected stock price volatility of 75 percent 

  

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the taxeffected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards historically we have recorded a full valuation allowance to fully reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of being able to realize these benefits 

  

if our positive trend of earnings continues it is likely that the valuation allowance will be reversed at some point in the future however we cannot predict which quarter this will occur

overview of results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 31 2005 

  

revenues during fiscal 2005 were 1764 million an increase of 84 percent over fiscal 2004 the total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005 from approximately 127000 as of january 31 2004 

  

our gross profit during fiscal 2005 was 1429 million or 81 percent of revenues and operating income was 65 million operating income for the period included a noncash stockbased expense of 36 million during fiscal 2004 we generated a gross profit of 788 million or 82 percent of revenues and had operating income of 37 million substantially all of which resulted from the reduction in accruals related to the release of future obligations associated with a portion of the office space that we abandoned in december 2001 operating income during fiscal 2004 also included 44 million of noncash stockbased expense 

  

during fiscal 2005 we continued to incur substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base professional services personnel to support our consulting services and developers to broaden and enhance our ondemand service 

  

in june 2004 we completed our initial public offering and sold 11500000 shares of common stock at a price of 1100 per share through which we raised a total of 1265 million in gross proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount of 88 million and offering expenses of 39 million net proceeds were 1138 million 

  

during fiscal 2005 we generated 559 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 218 million during fiscal 2004 at january 31 2005 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 2059 million as compared to 358 million at january 31 2004 accounts receivable of 489 million as compared to 265 million at january 31 2004 and deferred revenue of 959 million as compared to 497 million at january 31 2004 

  

fiscal years ended january 31 2005 and 2004 

  

revenues total revenues were 1764 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 960 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of 804 million or 84 percent subscription and support revenues were 1580 million or 90 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2005 compared to 858 million or 89 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying 

  

subscribers to approximately 227000 as of january 31 2005 from approximately 127000 as of january 31 2004 professional services and other revenues were 184 million or 10 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2005 compared to 102 million or 11 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2004 the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers 

  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 355 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 171 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 184 million or 108 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities 

  

cost of revenues  cost of revenues was 335 million or 19 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 173 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 162 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of 121 million in employeerelated costs substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since january 31 2004 an increase of 19 million in service delivery costs and an increase of 17 million in allocated overhead the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by 23 million we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded 

  

the increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers 

  

as described above we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our ondemand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in any particular quarterly period during fiscal 2006 our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may slightly exceed 20 percent 

  

research and development  research and development expenses were 98 million or 5 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 70 million or 7 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 28 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs of 23 million and an increase of 04 million in allocated overhead we increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since january 31 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

  

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses were 963 million or 55 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 546 million or 57 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 417 million the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of 343 million in employeerelated costs 35 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and 34 million in allocated overhead of the 343 million increase in employeerelated costs 70 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since january 31 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses were 303 million or 17 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2005 compared to 169 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 an increase of 134 million the increase was due to an increase of 83 million in employeerelated costs and 51 million in professional and outside service costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since january 31 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth the increase in professional and outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the united states 

  

lease recovery the lease recovery of 34 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the san francisco california office space that we abandoned in december 2001 in august 2003 we entered into an agreement releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant accordingly we recorded a 34 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space 

  

in march 2005 we entered into an agreement with our landlord that would release us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in our headquarters building in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building the agreement is contingent upon the occurrence of certain conditions that will affect the final determination of the lease abandonment accrual on our consolidated balance sheet if these certain conditions occur we believe there will be an immaterial reduction in the accrual which will be reflected as lease recovery during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

because of the march 2005 agreement described above we are currently evaluating the possibility of consolidating more of our operations in the headquarters building if we did this we would abandon approximately 20000 square feet of office space located elsewhere in san francisco which is under a longterm operating lease commitment such an abandonment would result in a charge against our operating results in the quarter in which the event would occur 

  

operating income operating income during fiscal 2005 was 65 million during fiscal 2004 it was 37 million substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above the increase in operating income year over year was primarily due to the increase in revenues most of which was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

  

income losses from operations outside of the americas was 27 million during fiscal 2005 and 11 million during fiscal 2004 the continued investment outside of the americas was due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities 

  

interest income  interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options none of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the company and all of them repaid their loan balances by february 28 2005 interest income was 27 million during fiscal 2005 and was 379000 during fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in june 2004 

  

provision for income taxes  we recorded a provision for income tax expense of 12 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of 541000 for fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as our foreign income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 and 2004 was 13 percent the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit 

  

as of january 31 2005 our deferred tax asset balance was 282 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings if any the timing and amount of which are uncertain to realize the deferred tax assets pretax income must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized historic profits have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date further ongoing stock option exercise activity may as in fiscal 2005 increase the total deferred tax asset balance accordingly management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets and therefore we have fully offset net deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 

  

based on our estimates for fiscal 2006 and beyond we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where deferred tax assets may be realized if we were to 

  

determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our income or reduce our loss and increase stockholders’ equity in the quarter when such determination is made 

  

the change in the valuation allowance of 85 million is primarily due to the uncertainties of realizing certain domestic losses net operating losses incurred by the japanese joint venture and certain tax credit carryforwards the balance in the valuation allowance at the end of fiscal 2005 includes approximately 81 million for stock plan deductions which will be credited to additional capital and the provision for income taxes if realized 

  

we currently believe that our fiscal 2006 effective tax rate will be approximately 25 percent exclusive of the impact of expensing stock options beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of fullyear income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction the estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items these actual results could vary from those projected

revenues total revenues were 960 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 510 million during fiscal 2003 an increase of 450 million or 88 percent subscription and support revenues were 858 million or 89 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2004 compared to 477 million or 93 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2003 the increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 127000 as of january 31 2004 from approximately 76000 as of january 31 2003 professional services and other revenues were 102 million or 11 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2004 compared to 33 million or 7 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2003 the increase in professional service and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increasing number of paying subscribers and customers 

  

revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for 171 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 compared to 71 million or 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 an increase of 100 million or 141 percent the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and the expansion of our international selling and marketing activities 

  

cost of revenues  cost of revenues was 173 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 compared to 104 million or 20 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 an increase of 69 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 54 million in employeerelated costs substantially all of which was due to the 53 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization and an increase of 700000 in service delivery costs we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the higher demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded 

  

the increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve new customers and paying subscribers 

  

research and development  research and development expenses were 70 million or 7 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 compared to 46 million or 9 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 an increase of 24 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 18 million in employeerelated costs our research and development headcount increased by 57 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to upgrade and extend our service offerings 

  

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses were 546 million or 57 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 compared to 335 million or 66 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 an increase of 211 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 180 million in employeerelated costs 10 million in increased marketing event costs 800000 in payments to partners and 700000 in allocated 

  

overhead of the 180 million in increased employeerelated costs 66 million was related to sales commissions our marketing and sales headcount increased by 42 percent from fiscal 2003 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses were 169 million or 18 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2004 compared to 130 million or 26 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 an increase of 39 million the increase was primarily due to an increase of 30 million in employeerelated costs and an increase of 900000 in professional and outside service costs our general and administrative headcount increased by 29 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to support our growth 

  

lease recovery in december 2001 we abandoned excess office space in san francisco california and recorded a 77 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 pertaining to the estimated future net obligations under the noncancelable lease since the space was not leased to a subtenant there were no immediate cash savings from the abandonment 

  

in august 2003 we entered into an agreement releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant accordingly we recorded a 43 million credit to reflect the reversal of the remaining accrued liability that was directly associated with this space during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded an additional accrual of 900000 related to the remaining 5000 square feet of abandoned office space in san francisco this additional accrual resulted from a revision of our estimates of the timing and amount of projected subtenant income based on difficulties in subleasing the remaining space 

  

operating income loss operating income during fiscal 2004 was 37 million and included the 34 million lease recovery described above the operating loss during fiscal 2003 was 105 million the increase in operating income was primarily due to a 450 million increase in revenues most of which was reinvested in an effort to expand our business 

  

loss from operations outside of the americas was 11 million during fiscal 2004 and was 38 million during fiscal 2003 the continued losses outside of the americas were due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities 

  

interest income  interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options interest income was 379000 during fiscal 2004 compared to 471000 during fiscal 2003 a decrease of 92000 the decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates and the mix of marketable securities investments substantially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances 

  

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes of 541000 during fiscal 2004 represented federal alternative minimum taxes of approximately 200000 and various state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of approximately 300000 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 13 percent as compared to zero for fiscal 2003 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit 

  

our deferred tax asset balance at january 31 2004 was 197 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount due to uncertainties regarding realization of the deferred tax asset balance 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at january 31 2005 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2059 million accounts receivable of 489 million and cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 of 559 million 

  

in june 2004 we completed the sale of 11500000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering including the underwriters’ exercise of an overallotment option and realized net proceeds of 1138 million to date we have not spent any of the proceeds from the initial public offering 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 559 million during fiscal 2005 218 million during fiscal 2004 and 52 million during fiscal 2003 the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service cash provided by or used in operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services changes in working capital accounts particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stockbased awards 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 1492 million during fiscal 2005 211 million during fiscal 2004 and 96 million during fiscal 2003 the increase in amounts used in fiscal 2005 primarily related to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering the investment of excess cash the reduction in restricted cash balances and capital expenditures associated with computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and work force 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 1189 million during fiscal 2005 11 million during fiscal 2004 and 10 million during fiscal 2003 the 1185 million of net proceeds from both the sale of common stock during the initial public offering and the exercise of employee stock options and the collection of 10 million in notes receivable from stockholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations and the repurchase of unvested shares of common stock from terminated employees at january 31 2005 our employees held 47 million vested stock options at a weighted average exercise price of 188 per share if our employees exercise these awards we will receive a significant amount of proceeds from the option exercises 

  

during fiscal 2001 we established a 35 million letter of credit in favor of our principal office landlord this amount was reduced in june 2004 to 28 million this letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit which is maintained at the granting financial institution for the same amount this certificate of deposit is included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2005 the letter of credit was outstanding and to date no amounts have been drawn against it the letter of credit renews annually through december 31 2010 

  

in addition we had two additional letters of credit outstanding as of january 31 2005 which are related to office space leases these letters of credit are collateralized by certificates of deposit totaling 04 million at the granting financial institution for the same amount and are included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet these letters of credit are due at various dates through december 2008 

  

we do not have any special purpose entities and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements additionally we currently do not have a bank line of credit 

  

our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space computer equipment and furniture and fixtures we also have longterm liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments at january 31 2005 the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our longterm liability were as follows 

  

   

our office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 

  

in february 2005 we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of 88 million additionally we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services additional data center capacity and a development and test data center we expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006 while the costs for these will be significant we believe that most of the capital expenditures for the additional business continuity services additional data center capacity and development and test data center will be leased so there will not be a significant impact on our liquidity during fiscal 2006 

  

purchase orders are not included in the table above our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our marketing and sales activities the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses services or technologies we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

  

recent accounting pronouncement 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas 123r on august 1 2005 which is the start of our third fiscal quarter next year we are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

  

additionally sfas 123r requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows we currently classify these tax benefits which totaled 798000 in fiscal 2005 as a source of cash provided by operating activities 

  

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

we are an earlystage company in an emerging market with an unproven business model a new and unproven enterprise technology model and a short operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

  

we have only a limited operating history and our current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate we were founded in february 1999 and began offering our ondemand crm application service in february 2000 the risks and difficulties we encounter as an earlystage company in the new and rapidly evolving market of ondemand crm application services include the following 

  

   

   

   

we may not be able to successfully address any of these risks or others including the other risks related to our business and industry described below failure to adequately do so could seriously harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 

  

defects in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability 

  

because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of software both developed inhouse and acquired from third party vendors our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business internetbased services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business any errors defects or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

  

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty web hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

  

we provide our service through computer hardware that is currently located in a thirdparty web hosting facility in sunnyvale california operated by qwest communications international inc we do not control the operation of this facility and it is subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events it is also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct despite precautions taken at the facility the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at the facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition the failure by the qwest facility to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service we have an agreement with sungard data systems a provider of availability services to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us access to hardware software and internet connectivity in the event the qwest facility becomes unavailable even with this disaster recovery arrangement however our service would be interrupted during the transition we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity however none of the services or capacity is currently operational any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service interruptions in our service 

  

may reduce our revenue cause us to issue credits or pay penalties cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates our business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

  

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

  

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth for example in the last ten fiscal quarters we have recorded quarterly operating income of as much as 43 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as 49 million we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations 

  

as a result we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 

  

our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

  

our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

some of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future 

  

we incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in february 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we generated small profits in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as we are a young company in an emerging market we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may incur additional significant operating losses in the future in addition we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased expenses we will not continue to be profitable you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance in fact in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline furthermore if our operating expenses exceed our expectations our financial performance will be adversely affected 

  

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities 

  

our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers’ data our reputation will be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 

  

because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

  

we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements which are typically 12 to 24 months although terms can range from one to 60 months as a result much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 

  

if our ondemand application service is not widely accepted our operating results will be harmed 

  

we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our ondemand application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future as a result widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future success factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

many of these factors are beyond our control the inability of our ondemand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business 

  

the market for our technology delivery model and ondemand application services is immature and volatile and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect our business will be harmed 

  

the market for ondemand application services is new and unproven and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises large and small to increase their use of ondemand application services in general and for crm in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to ondemand application services furthermore some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use ondemand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities among other things of the technology delivery model associated with these services if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of ondemand application services then the market for these services may not develop at all or it may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results in addition as a new company in this unproven market we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business 

  

we do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

  

our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact some customers have elected not to do so in addition our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

  

our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management if these efforts are not successful our business may suffer 

  

our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

  

we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and will continue to place to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively to do so we must continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed if our new hires perform poorly or if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmed to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and 

  

management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term if we fail to successfully manage our growth we will be unable to execute our business plan 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses which have a greater rate of attrition and nonrenewal than mediumsized and large enterprise customers 

  

our small business customers which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees typically have shorter initial subscription periods and based on our limited experience to date have had a higher rate of attrition and nonrenewal as compared to our mediumsized and large enterprise customers if we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough our revenue could decline 

  

our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large customers 

  

our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends in large part on widespread acceptance of our service by mediumsized and large businesses our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful in particular because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical crm applications from one of our larger more established competitors even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service which could harm our business 

  

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become more timeconsuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers all of which could harm our business 

  

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we will face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in this market segment the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprisewide decision and if so these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service in addition larger customers may demand more customization integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical requirements have been met in addition larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

  

the market for crm applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing barriers to entry are relatively low many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants we expect competition to intensify in the future if we fail to compete effectively our operating results will be harmed some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures if we are unable to maintain our current pricing our operating results could be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

  

our current principal competitors include 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop andor bundle crm products with their products in the future we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors but who are developing directly competitive ondemand crm application services offerings such as siebel systems through siebel crm ondemand our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators including accenture ltd bearingpoint inc and ibm as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them even as we compete for business in other customer engagements 

  

many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial technical and other resources in addition many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases and have major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers 

  

as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements furthermore because of these advantages even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

  

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments our business will be harmed 

  

if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business will be harmed the success of enhancements new features and services such as supportforce and customforce depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies or modifications to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

  

any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed 

  

to date we have focused our business on providing ondemand application services for the crm market but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets however any efforts to expand beyond the crm market may never result in significant revenue growth for us in addition efforts to expand our ondemand application service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business which may harm our business 

  

if we fail to develop our brand costeffectively our business may suffer 

  

we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforcecom brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers furthermore we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices in the past our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business could suffer 

  

any failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth 

  

we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers particularly large enterprise customers and to manage our customer base we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and may in some cases take more than a year before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded 

  

sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

  

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states for example sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005 18 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2004 and 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in us dollars and paid in local currency as a result fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers which could harm our business we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation 

  

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business might be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future in addition if any patents are issued in the future they may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

  

we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

  

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

  

the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims or rights against their use any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others 

  

we rely on thirdparty hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service 

  

we rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service including database software from oracle corporation this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business 

  

we may be required to purchase the interest in our japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner under certain circumstances on terms that may not be favorable to us 

  

in some circumstances we may be required to purchase the interest of our japanese joint venture partner if we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture in the event we are required to purchase our partner’s interest in the joint venture we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital which could harm our financial condition although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase were it to be required are not predictable if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing which occurred in september 2003 the buyout price could be as much as approximately 130 million 

  

if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future they could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies services and technologies in the future we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock as a result if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 

  

evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 

  

as internet commerce continues to evolve increasing regulation by federal state or foreign agencies becomes more likely for example we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased services which could harm our business 

  

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business 

  

our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies however have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed 

  

by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries for example regulations such as the grammleachbliley act which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service 

  

the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are far more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect andor use demographic and personal information from their customers which could reduce demand for our service 

  

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner crm solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business 

  

the success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the internet as a business tool 

  

expansion in the sales of our service depends on the continued acceptance of the internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises the internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity security reliability cost easeofuse accessibility and qualityofservice the performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been harmed by “viruses” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure if for any reason the internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform the demand for our service would be significantly reduced which would harm our business 

  

our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 

  

we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies including the securities and exchange commission new york stock exchange and public company accounting oversight board that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded our efforts to comply with these new regulations most notably the sarbanesoxley act or sox have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 

  

by the end of fiscal 2006 we are required to comply with the sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment although we believe our ongoing review and testing of our internal controls will enable us to be compliant with the sox requirements we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate by the end of fiscal 2006 if we cannot assess our internal controls over financial reporting as effective or our external auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on such assessment our stock price could decline 

  

moreover because these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available this evolution may result in 

  

continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes our business may be harmed 

  

we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

  

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly marc benioff our chief executive officer and chairman of the board steve cakebread our chief financial officer jim steele our president of worldwide sales and services pat sueltz our president of global operations and parker harris our executive vice president of technology we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers key management development or operations personnel and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business 

  

because competition for our target employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

  

to continue to execute on our growth plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services and senior sales executives we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience in the future difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment volatility in the price of our stock may therefore adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees furthermore the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 

  

we might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available 

  

we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 

  

we believe our reported financial results will be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 

  

for example in december 2004 the fasb announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options we plan to adopt this new accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we believe this change in accounting will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

if our involvement in a lengthy may 9 2004 new york times article about salesforcecom or any other publicity regarding salesforcecom or the initial public offering during the waiting period were held to be “gun jumping” in violation of the securities act of 1933 we could be required to repurchase securities sold in our initial public offering 

  

in a new york times article dated may 9 2004 and entitled “it’s not google it’s that other big ipo” information regarding our initial public offering and salesforcecom our development and our business strategy was published in preparation of the article the reporter spent most of a full day with marc benioff our chairman and ceo as a result it could have been expected that a lengthy article would be published portions of this new york times article were subsequently reprinted by a number of news outlets while some of the factual statements about salesforcecom in the article were disclosed in the registration statement for our initial public offering the article presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the registration statement 

  

in addition to the new york times article there was substantial additional press coverage regarding us and the initial public offering during the offering process these articles also presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the registration statement 

  

in order to reduce the risk of investors’ possible reliance on the new york times article and other news reports and articles we stopped our offering on may 13 2004 we then allowed a “cooling off” period to pass so that the effect of this article and other reports articles and information would be dissipated 

  

it is uncertain whether the may 9th new york times article or any of our publicity related activities could be held to be a violation of section 5 of the securities act if any article or activity was held by a court to be in violation of the securities act we could be required to repurchase the shares sold to purchasers in our public offering at the original 1100 purchase price plus interest for a period of one year following the date of the violation we would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the securities act occurred 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

  

the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile accordingly the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations further our common stock has a limited trading history factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation such as the lawsuits following the approximate 25 decline in our stock price on july 21 2004 which may harm our business and results of operations 

  

if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock the price of our stock could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline rapidly furthermore if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

  

the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 

  

our executive officers directors current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders acting together will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions even if other stockholders oppose them this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro british pound canadian dollar and japanese yen we have a risk management policy that allows us to utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations to date we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 

  

if we were to enter into hedging contracts the contracts by policy would have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period additionally by policy we would not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had unrestricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 2059 million at january 31 2005 these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings the unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase in interest rates of 100basis points could result in higher interest income of 08 million offset by a principal reduction of 16 million for a net reduction of 08 million over a 12month period similarly a 100basis point decrease could result in a decrease in interest income of 08 million and a principal increase of 16 million for a net increase of 08 million fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

none 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in periodic sec reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can therefore only provide reasonable not absolute assurance that the design will succeed in achieving its stated goals 

  

since we are not yet an accelerated filer we are not currently required to comply with section 404  management assessment of internal controls  of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are in the process of implementing what we believe will be sufficient internal control structures and procedures for our financial reporting such that our management can provide the required certifications as to these structures and procedures in our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ending january 31 2006 

  

b changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on form 10k that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting
