customers sales and marketing 

our primary customers include orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts and some healthcare dealers inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors some healthcare dealers and hospitals dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment consignment sales represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2021 no individual customer accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2021

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels 

we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical 

 

developments and other issues related to orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical and dental procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through four operating segments our operating segments are comprised of americas orthopedics europe middle east and africa “emea” asia pacific and americas spine and global dental the following is a summary of our operating segments see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments

americas orthopedics the americas orthopedics operating segment is our largest operating segment this segment is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets for our orthopedic product categories this segment also includes research development engineering medical education and brand management for our orthopedic product category headquarter locations the us accounts for approximately 95 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

emea   the emea operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for approximately 55 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa this operating segment includes all product categories in these markets except for dental our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment 

asia pacific the asia pacific operating segment includes key markets such as japan china australia new zealand korea taiwan india thailand singapore hong kong and malaysia japan is the largest market within this segment accounting for approximately 50 percent of the region’s sales this operating segment includes all product categories in these markets except for dental in japan and most countries in the asia pacific region we maintain a network of dealers who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region and sales associates who build and maintain relationships with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets the knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service product information and support to surgeons in certain countries of this region healthcare is sponsored by governments most notably in 2021 the chinese government began to implement a nationwide volumebased procurement “vbp” process across certain of our product categories that negatively affected our net sales due to distributor inventory reductions ongoing pricing negotiations with distributor partners revaluation of channel inventory and volume reductions as patients deferred procedures until after vbp pricing has become effective 

americas spine and global dental  the americas spine and global dental operating segment constitutes a majority of the operations that will be spun off to zimvie the us accounts for approximately 75 percent of sales in this operating segment the americas spine market dynamics are similar to americas orthopedics however the spine business maintains a separate sales force of independent sales agents in our dental products division our sales force is primarily composed of employees who market our products to customers we sell directly to dental practices or dental laboratories or to independent stocking distributors depending on the market 

seasonality

our business is seasonal in nature to some extent as many of our products are used in elective procedures which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans additionally with sales to customers where title to product passes upon shipment these customers may purchase items in large quantities if incentives are offered or if there are new product offerings in a market which could cause periodtoperiod differences in sales due to the covid19 global pandemic the typical seasonal patterns did not occur in 2020 or 2021

 

distribution 

we distribute our products both through large centralized warehouses and through smaller market specific facilities depending on the needs of the market we maintain large centralized warehouses in the us and europe to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in those regions in addition to these centralized warehouses we maintain smaller distribution facilities in the us and in each of the countries where we have a direct sales presence in many locations our inventory is consigned to the healthcare institution

we generally ship our orders via expedited courier since most of our sales occur at the time of an elective procedure we generally do not have firm orders

government regulation and compliance

our operations products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the us our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex there is a global trend toward increased regulatory activity related to medical products

in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public

most of our new products fall into an fda medical device classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are classified by fda regulation as exempt from premarket clearance and approval or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 

in january 2021 the fda announced a new “action plan” to address software as a medical device “samd” and artificial intelligence and machine learning “aiml” certain of our new products will likely incorporate innovations related to aiml and therefore we will monitor developments in this area closely to determine our compliance obligations and risks

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as requirements for advertising and promotion of our devices our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the qsr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or approval to market new and existing products and is also necessary for distributing in the us certain devices exempt from fda clearance and approval requirements the fda conducts announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form fda483 “form 483” that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products seizure of products and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 2 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us and can prevent the importation of products the fda deems to violate the fdca or its implementing regulations the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac” in addition exported medical products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported

there are also requirements of state and local governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products

in many of the countries in which our products are sold we are subject to supranational national regional and local regulations affecting among other things the development design manufacturing product standards packaging advertising promotion labeling marketing and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices the member countries of the european union the “eu” have adopted the european medical device directive the “mdd” which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the mdd and certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the mdd we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in may 2017 a new eu medical device regulation “mdr” was published that will replace the mdd and will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the effective date for the mdr was extended to may 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic under a corrigendum to the mdr finalized in december 2019 some lowrisk medical devices being upclassified as a result of the mdr including lowrisk instruments may now receive a transitional period to comply by may 2024

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 13485 the qsr the mdd and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our principal manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 and audited at regular intervals additionally our principal sites are certified under the medical device single audit program “mdsap” which is a voluntary audit program developed by regulatory authorities in five countries ie australia brazil canada japan and the united states to assess compliance with the quality management system regulatory requirements of those countries mdsap audits are conducted by an mdsaprecognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of the participating regulatory jurisdictions replacing standard surveillance audits by the regulatory authorities in those countries

further we are subject to other supranational national regional federal state and local laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical products manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the united kingdom “uk” bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj which concluded on february 9 2021 six months following certification to the doj and the us securities and exchange commission “sec” by an independent compliance monitor that our compliance program including its policies and procedures is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations of the fcpa and is functioning effectively 

 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices the fda and the department of homeland security “dhs” have issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information the us department of health and human services “hhs” through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 10 2020 hhs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” to modify the hipaa privacy rule the proposed modifications would remove communication barriers between providers and health plans allow individuals more access to their health information and impose new requirements on entities that receive patient data requests separately hhs through the national coordinator for health information technology issued a new rule to be effective april 5 2021 that seeks to limit “blocking” of electronic health information by imposing data access software licensing and interoperability requirements on healthcare providers and information technology vendors we intend to monitor both the npr and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners a second law called the california privacy rights act “cpra” passed via a ballot referendum in november 2020 the cpra expands the scope of the ccpa imposes new restrictions on behavioral advertising and establishes a new california privacy protection agency which will enforce the law and issue regulations the cpra is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 1 2022 other states have considered andor enacted similar privacy laws we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigation and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business

outside of the us data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and member state implementing legislation and the brazil lei geral de proteção de dados the “lgpd” also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 imposes data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year

 

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business 

competition

the orthopedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for our knees hips and set products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation and smith  nephew plc there are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

in the spine product category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic plc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation nuvasive inc and globus medical inc

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with the straumann group dentsply sirona inc and nobel biocare services ag  part of envista holdings corporation

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities

risks related to our business operations and strategy 

t he covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and remain unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic pandemic or contagious diseases such as covid19 we continue to experience a decline in elective surgical procedures globally due to the covid19 pandemic in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 the highly transmissible delta and omicron variants resulted in further deferrals of elective surgical procedures and we believe that staffing shortages at hospitals also contributed to the deferral of such procedures we expect these declines to continue for the duration of the pandemic and they may be further impacted by covid19 variants and resurgences 

the covid19 global pandemic has had and we expect it to continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows our net sales have not returned to prepandemic levels it is not certain when our financial condition results of operations or cash flows will return to prepandemic levels 

 

deferral of elective surgical procedures has caused us to experience certain of the following  and we may experience other of the following among other potential negative outcomes  















covid19 and the current financial economic and capital markets environment and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance financial condition volume of business results of operations and cash flows 

our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings andor operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives

in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a global restructuring program the “2019 restructuring plan” with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities which program is ongoing in december 2021 our management also initiated a global restructuring program the “2021 restructuring plan” to reorganize our operations in preparation for the planned spinoff of zimvie with an objective of reducing costs restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include or result in workforce reductions global plant closures andor consolidations product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiencies during transitional periods restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements andor cost reductions or otherwise harm our business including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program as well as management distraction for more information on our restructuring program see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our success largely depends on the strength of our talent including our senior management and ensuring we have meaningful succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business

our future performance depends in large part on the continued skills experiences competencies and services of our senior management and other key talent including our ability to attract retain develop and motivate key talent competition for talent in the various geographies and business segments in which we operate is significant our ability to attract and retain key talent in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation packages there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key talent or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key talent could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and orderly transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations

 

we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions

our acquisitions involve numerous risks including















as a result if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions

the planned spinoff of our spine and dental businesses may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all and may not achieve the intended results

as previously announced we plan to spin off our spine and dental businesses to form zimvie inc a new and independent publicly traded company “zimvie” through a taxfree distribution to our stockholders of publicly traded stock in zimvie unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned spinoff therefore we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced or at all

we expect the completion of the spinoff to continue to require significant expenses and management time and effort we will have continuing obligations to zimvie after the completion of the spinoff which may cause us to incur additional costs the spinoff will also require modifications to our systems and processes used to operate our business we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications during or following the spinoff which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations following the spinoff we will be a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could adversely affect our operating results we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the spinoff and following its completion which could harm our business

further if the spinoff is completed the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction strategic and competitive advantages of each company and future growth and other opportunities for each company may not be realized within the expected time periods or at all  failure to implement the spinoff effectively could also result in a lower value to our company and our stockholders 

the planned spinoff and any subsequent divestiture of our retained interest in zimvie could result in substantial tax liability

we obtained an internal revenue service “irs” ruling and we intend to obtain an opinion as to the taxfree nature of the spinoff under the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the irs ruling is and the opinion will be based among other things on various factual assumptions and representations we will make if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized if the spinoff does not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes the resulting tax liability to us to our stockholders and to zimvie stockholders could be substantial 

we have announced we intend to retain 197 of the outstanding shares of zimvie common stock upon the spinoff and to divest these shares after the spinoff in a taxefficient manner there can be no assurance that any such divestiture will occur will occur at a time or times favorable to us or will occur at prices or on terms favorable to us additionally there can be no assurance that any such divestiture achieves a desired or any favorable tax 

 

treatment if the divesture does not achieve a favorable tax treatment the resulting tax liability to us to our stockholders and to zimvie stockholders could be substantial 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we and our thirdparty manufacturers have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants damage to one or more facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events vulnerabilities in technology cyberattacks against our information systems or the information systems of our business partners such as ransomware attacks or issues in manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics or local state or national reactions to such epidemics or other factors could adversely affect the ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand we have experienced such interruptions due to the covid19 pandemic and we may experience such interruptions in the future in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty suppliers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other worldwide regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers manufacturing processes and the need for clearance or approval of significant changes by worldwide regulatory bodies prior to implementation  a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products  such as due to one or more suppliers experiencing reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics  an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide or reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders

 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities in addition some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information of patients employees and customers collectively “confidential information” 

our information systems and those of thirdparty suppliers with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards changing threats and vulnerabilities and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty vendors andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information 

like other large multinational corporations we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future we also are subject to other cyberattacks including statesponsored cyberattacks industrial espionage insider threats computer denialofservice attacks computer viruses ransomware and other malware payment fraud or other cyber incidents in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic a significant number of our employees who are able to work remotely are doing so and malicious cyber actors may increase malware campaigns and phishing emails targeting teleworkers preying on the uncertainties surrounding covid19 which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks our incident response efforts business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could























while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents however cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive therefore despite our efforts we cannot assure that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies 

 

including biological therapies  to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 













in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including







our competitors may











any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products

if we fail to retain the employees and independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our employees’ agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of















without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to











 

 







in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors







moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels or change reimbursement models for hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets for example china has implemented a volumebased procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products including through political changes or transitions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing for example china has implemented a volumebased procurement process designed to decrease prices for certain medical devices and other products which has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in reduced margins on covered devices and products required renegotiation of distributor arrangements and incurrence of inventoryrelated charges pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses reductions in reimbursement levels and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally

in addition many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making 

 

sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

financial credit and liquidity risks 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations and the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor andor other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions at december 31 2021 our total indebtedness was 71 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014  as of december 31 2021 our debt service principal obligations excluding interest leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 16 billion as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things

















in addition the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate “libor” or “libo rate” any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows further in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates to the ice benchmark administration limited on march 5 2021 the fca publicly announced publication of all nonus dollar denominated libo rate settings as well as the 1week and 2month us dollar denominated libo rate will permanently cease as of december 31 2021 and that publication of the overnight and 12month us dollar denominated libo rate settings will permanently cease after june 30 2023 in addition the fca announced that immediately after june 30 2023 the 1month 3month and 6month us dollar libo rates will cease to be provided or subject to the fca’s consideration of the case may be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality that they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored the dates announced by the fca may change or other administrators of libo rates andor regulators may take further action that could change or otherwise impact the availability and characteristics of libo rates currencies and tenors the credit agreements governing our debt provide a mechanism for determining alternative rates of interest using customary hardwired rate replacement provisions which establish a waterfall approach for establishment of a replacement benchmark interest rate in the event that libo rates are unavailable subject to spread adjustments to be determined with reference to the recommendations of relevant governmental bodies or in certain circumstances evolving or thenprevailing market conventions for determining or calculating such spread adjustment for us dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities any alternative successor or replacement rate may not be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence of the libo rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the libo rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability which may increase our overall interest expense on unhedged variable rate indebtedness which is currently based on the libo rate

we will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur accordingly the potential effect of the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as euribor or tibor on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined further the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for 

 

calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense for example changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes as adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

the proposed build back better act or similar legislation if enacted could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact our effective tax rate 

the build back better act proposed an increase in the us global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign minimum tax rate from 105 to 15 assessing the gilti tax on a per country basis reduction of the foreignderived intangible income tax benefit and disallowance of certain corporate interest expense if any or all of these or similar proposals are ultimately enacted into law in whole or in part they could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our independent agents and distributors are characterized as employees we would be subject to additional tax and other liabilities

we structure our relationships with independent agents and distributors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship not an employee relationship although we believe that our independent agents and distributors are properly characterized as independent contractors tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships further we have been subject to lawsuits challenging the characterization of these relationships in recent years changes in classification from independent contractor to employee can result in a change to various requirements associated with the payment of wages tax withholding and the provision of unemployment health and other traditional employeremployee related benefits if regulatory authorities or state federal or foreign courts were to determine that our independent agents or distributors are employees and not independent contractors we would be required to withhold income taxes to withhold and pay social security medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes we would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties as a result any determination that our independent agents and distributors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results

goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets at december 31 2021 we had  92 billion in goodwill and  63 billion of intangible assets the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 6120 million as a result of the adverse impacts from the covid19 pandemic and a change in our reportable segments and in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 we recorded 163 million and 330 million respectively of inprocess research and development “iprd” intangible asset impairments on certain iprd projects  if the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels including if elective surgical procedures are deferred longer than our current expectations due to the covid19 pandemic if competing or alternative technologies emerge if 

 

market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units we could be required to record additional impairment charges any writeoff of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

global operational risks 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2021 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including





























violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the japanese yen the swiss franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us further if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions

 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development design product standards packaging advertising promotion postmarket surveillance manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex the products we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other supranational national federal regional state and local governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other supranational national federal regional state and local requirements globally compliance with these requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators which may result in observations such as on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk they could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health f urthermore the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that we may make about approved or cleared products if the fda determines that we have marketed or promoted a product for offlabel use—uses other than those indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda—we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us andor recommend prosecution any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

in august 2018 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility as of february 25 2022 this warning letter remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements

governmental regulations outside the us continue to become increasingly stringent and complex in the eu for example the mdr became effective in may 2021 and includes significant additional premarket and post market requirements complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense additionally the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the mdr any such delays or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements similarly the separation of states from participation in the eu such as through the cessation of the uk’s membership in the eu commonly known as “brexit” and the separation of the swiss and eu medical product markets with the adoption of mdr commonly referred to as “swexit” may result in further regulatory risk and complexity as the former eu member or participant state establishes separate laws and regulations governing medical products

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

 

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the false claims act the antikickback statute the stark law the physician payments sunshine act the food drug and cosmetic act and similar laws and regulations in the us and around the world in addition we are subject to various laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters including the fcpa sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices the fda and the dhs have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under hipaa hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information hhs through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 10 2020 hhs issued an npr to modify the hipaa privacy rule separately hhs through the national coordinator for health information technology issued a new rule which took effect on april 5 2021 that limits “blocking” of electronic health information we intend to monitor both the npr and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other personal information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners a second law in california the cpra passed via a ballot referendum in november 2020 the cpra expands the scope of the ccpa and establishes a new california privacy protection agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations the cpra is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 1 2022 other states have considered andor enacted similar privacy laws we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigations and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws outside of the us data protection laws including the gdpr in the eu “eu gdpr” and the uk “uk gdpr” the lgpd in brazil and the personal information protection law “pipl” in china also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to our customers the uk gdpr and eu gdpr impose among other things data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer uk and eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year under the eu gdpr and up to the greater of 175 million pounds or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year under the uk gdpr  the issue of new standard contractual clauses “sccs” governing crossborder data transfers between controllers and processors by the eu commission in conjunction with related requirements on 

 

conducting data transfer impact assessments in respect of crossborder data transfers from the eu and the uk may involve an increase in our costs of compliance as we transition to those sccs and subject us to increased scrutiny by eu and uk regulators  the pipl which took effect on november 1 2021 shares many similarities with the eu gdpr this includes extraterritorial reach strict restrictions on transfer of personal information including in certain situations data localization or prior certificationauthorization requirements compliance obligations and sanctions for noncompliance of up to 5 of annual turnover or 50 million yuan it also seeks to impose additional requirements not currently contemplated under the eu gdpr the pipl may increase our costs of compliance subject us to enhanced scrutiny from chinese regulators and affect our crossborder data transfers 

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include substantial civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the ml taper and ml taper with kinectiv ® technology hip stems and versys ® femoral head implants and the m2amagnum tm hip system we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology processes methodologies and information we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure license assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish maintain and protect our proprietary rights as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license however the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 

in addition intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in particular a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible we may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct to prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our 

 

intellectual property we might be required to engage in costly and timeconsuming litigation or other proceedings and we may not ultimately prevail any failure to establish maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements there have been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and insider trading based on allegations that we made materially false andor misleading statements andor omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016  although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period

risks related to our organizational documents and jurisdiction of incorporation 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 









these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and 

 

employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

executive level overview

impact of the covid19 global pandemic 

our results continue to be impacted by the covid19 global pandemic the vast majority of our net sales are derived from products used in elective surgical procedures as covid19 rapidly started to spread throughout the world in early 2020 our net sales decreased dramatically as countries took precautions to prevent the spread of the virus with lockdowns and stayathome measures and as hospitals deferred elective surgical procedures the timing level and sustainability of the recovery of elective surgical procedures has been difficult to predict as a number of factors are involved including which geographies are affected and the different measures governments and healthcare systems take in response to the virus in those areas in the second half of 2021 the highly transmissible delta and omicron variants resulted in further deferrals of elective surgical procedures additionally we believe that staffing shortages at hospitals are also contributing to the deferral of elective surgical procedures 

2021 financial highlights 

in 2021 our net sales increased by 116 percent compared to 2020 primarily due to the significant deferral of elective surgical procedures at the onset of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 our net earnings were 4016 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of 1389 million in 2020 in 2021 we returned to profitability compared to a net loss in 2020 primarily due to higher net sales combined with fixed operating costs that did not increase proportionally to the increase in net sales and a reduction in operating expenses including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and certain fixed overhead and hourly production worker labor expenses in 2020 we recognized 6450 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges primarily due to the forecasted impact of covid19 on our operating results in the second quarter of 2020 we also temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities resulting in additional expense recognized in cost of products sold that related to certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses that are included in the cost of inventory when these facilities are operating at normal capacity the additional expense for suspended and limited production continued throughout 2020 and while we did recognize similar charges in 2021 they were lower than the 2020 charges these reduced expenses in 2021 were partially offset by a charge for the early extinguishment of debt higher research and development expenses including certain agreements we entered into to gain access to or acquire thirdparty inprocess rd projects higher consulting and professional service expenses related to the planned spinoff of our spine and dental businesses and higher litigationrelated charges 

2022 outlook 

we believe the covid19 variant surges and continuing staffing shortages that occurred late in 2021 will continue to negatively impact our net sales in 2022 as previously mentioned we expect to spin off our spine and dental businesses on march 1 2022 we expect to apply discontinued operations accounting after the separation which will require us to recast our prior period results to reflect both continuing and discontinued operations accordingly it is difficult to provide forwardlooking information that is comparable to our historical results until the recasting of prior periods is complete

results of operations

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set spine  dental and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate 

 

resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

net sales by geography

the following tables present net sales by geography and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

 



 



 

“foreign exchange” used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales

the following table presents net sales by product category by geography for our knees and hips product categories which represent our most significant product categories dollars in millions 

 



 

 

demand volumemix trends 

changes in volume and mix of product sales had a positive effect of 121 percent on yearoveryear sales during the year ended december 31 2021 volume trends were positive in 2021 as elective surgical procedures were not as significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as compared to 2020 when there were significant deferrals at the beginning of the pandemic however 2021 did experience periods with higher deferrals of elective surgical procedures most notably at the beginning of 2021 before vaccines were widely available and during surges of the delta and omicron virus variants accordingly net sales in 2021 did not return to the prepandemic levels of 2019

based upon country dynamics volume changes varied by region in 2021 the volume increases in 2021 were largely a product of how much the covid19 pandemic negatively affected the various regions in 2020 in emea stayathome measures were far more prevalent than other geographies in 2020 and therefore volume increases were greater in this region in 2021 as elective surgical procedures resumed in the americas elective surgical procedures in the us varied from statetostate depending on local infection rates and preventative measures in 2020 in asia pacific containment of the covid19 virus varied from countrytocountry in 2020 but overall some of our larger markets in this region were not as affected in 2020 as other locations additionally in asia pacific in 2021 china sales were negatively impacted from a combination of variables related to the implementation of a nationwide volumebased procurement “vbp” process the china vbp had a negative effect on volume due to inventory reductions by distributors and shortterm deferral of procedures as patients waited to have a surgical procedure performed until after vbp pricing is effective 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 18 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2021 in the majority of countries in which we operate we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems pricing in 2021 was also negatively affected by the anticipated china vbp implementation due to ongoing pricing negotiations with distributor partners   

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2021 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of 13 percent on yearoveryear sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates we estimate they will have a negative impact of approximately 20 percent on sales in 2022 for the full year 

 

estimated market trends 

the following table presents estimated 2021 global market information dollars in billions

 



 









expenses as a percent of net sales

 



 

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization

we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2021 and 2020 compared to the prior year

 



 

 

 

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower impact from intangible asset amortization as well as the fact that 2020 had higher charges from certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses when we temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities intangible asset amortization and excess and obsolete inventory charges did not increase ratably with the increase our net sales in 2021 and therefore were a positive impact to our gross margin percentage these favorable items were partially offset by hedge losses recognized in the current year as part of our hedging program compared to hedge gains in the prior year and lower average selling prices 

 

operating expenses

 

research  development “rd” expenses increased in both amount and as a percentage of net sales in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to reengaging in rd projects in 2021 including the implementation of the european union medical device regulation “eu mdr” compared to 2020 when covid19 caused delays in project spending in addition to reengaging in projects in 2021 we also entered into certain agreements to gain access to or acquire thirdparty inprocess rd projects that resulted in charges of 650 million

selling general  administrative “sga” expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 but decreased as a percentage of net sales sga expenses increased primarily due to higher variable selling and distribution costs related to increased net sales higher performancebased compensation in the current year as similar costs were reduced in the prior year due to the effect covid19 had on our operating results higher litigationrelated charges and increased travel and medical training and education costs as we have partially resumed these activities despite the increase in sga expenses sga as a percentage of net sales declined in 2021 when compared to 2020 as our sga expenses included many fixed costs that did not increase ratably with the increase in net sales in the 2021 period 

in 2021 we recognized an intangible asset impairment charge of 163 million in 2020 we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 6450 million including charges of 4700 million and 1420 million related to our emea and dental reporting units respectively in the first quarter of 2020 for more information regarding these charges see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements

in december 2021 our management approved a restructuring program to reorganize our operations in preparation for the planned spinoff of zimvie with an objective of reducing costs in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a restructuring program with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities we recognized expenses of 1291 million and 1169 million in the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively attributable to restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives primarily related to employee termination benefits sales agent contract terminations and consulting and project management expenses associated with these programs for more information regarding these expenses see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

our quality remediation expenses increased slightly to 531 million in 2021 compared to 509 million in 2020 we continue to incur quality remediation expenses to complete our remediation milestones that address inspectional observations on form 483 and a warning letter issued by the fda at our warsaw north campus facility among other matters 

acquisition integration divestiture and related expenses increased to 798 million in 2021 compared to 238 million in 2020 due primarily to consulting and other professional service expenses related to the planned spinoff of our spine and dental businesses and integration expenses related to the acquisitions made in 2020 

other income expense net interest expense net loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes

in 2021 our other income net was lower than in 2020 primarily due to losses recognized from changes to the fair value of our equity investments in 2021 compared to gains recognized in the prior year and lower pensionrelated gains recognized in 2021 compared to 2020 

interest expense net decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to debt paydown and fixedtovariable interest rate swaps we entered into in 2021

in 2021 we recognized a 1651 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on this loss

 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings before income taxes was 39 percent and 499 percent for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively in 2021 this was primarily driven by the foreign rate differential as our foreign locations have lower tax rates and favorable returntoprovision changes in estimate offset by unfavorable tax rate changes

in 2020 the income tax benefit was driven by changes in estimates to uncertain tax positions favorable tax audit settlements jurisdictional mix of earnings and losses and a 430 million tax benefit from switzerland’s federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “traf” other significant impacts to the etr in 2020 included the 6120 million goodwill impairment charge which resulted in a loss before taxes but had no corresponding tax benefit 

absent discrete tax events we expect our future etr will be lower than the us corporate income tax rate of 210 percent due to our mix of earnings between us and foreign locations which have lower corporate income tax rates our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pretax earnings changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit

 



in 2021 the americas orthopedics emea and americas spine and global dental operating segments’ operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased when compared to 2020 due the recovery of elective surgical procedures when compared to the deferrals that occurred during the onset of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 these operating segments have various fixed costs that do not fluctuate proportionally to net sales changes which results in improved operating profit as a percentage of net sales as net sales increase in the asia pacific operating segment while operating profit increased due to higher net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due the effect of the china vbp which had a significant negative effect on pricing in 2021 without a corresponding reduction in cost of products sold in addition the amount of our foreign currency exchange rate hedge gains recognized in this operating segment in 2021 was lower than the amount recognized in 2020

nongaap operating performance measures

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude as applicable certain inventory and manufacturingrelated charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines intangible asset amortization goodwill and intangible asset impairment restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses quality remediation expenses acquisition integration divestiture and related expenses certain litigation gains and charges expenses to establish initial compliance with the eu mdr expenses related to certain rd agreements loss on early extinguishment of debt other charges any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items the effect of switzerland tax reform other certain tax adjustments and with respect to earnings per share information provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business additionally we believe these nongaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance we believe these measures offer the ability to make periodtoperiod comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations the nongaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these 

 

types of items that are excluded from the nongaap measures in addition adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs

as of december 31 2021 we had 4785 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition we had 10 billion available to borrow under a 364day revolving credit agreement that matures on august 19 2022 and 15 billion available under a fiveyear revolving facility that matures on august 20 2026 the terms of the 364day revolving credit agreement and the 2021 fiveyear revolving facility are described further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

at the zimvie spinoff date we expect to receive approximately 500 million from zimvie as partial consideration for the contribution of assets in connection with the separation additionally we will retain 197 percent of the outstanding shares of zimvie common stock after the separation we intend to dispose of all of the zimvie common stock after the distribution by exchanging such zimvie common stock for zimmer biomet debt obligations over time

we believe that cash flows from operations our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash received from the spinoff of zimvie and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months however due to the continued uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic it is possible our needs may change further there can be no assurance that if needed we will be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

sources of liquidity

cash flows provided by operating activities were 14992 million in 2021 compared to 12045 million and 15858 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2021 when compared to 2020 was primarily the result of higher net earnings in the 2021 period additionally in 2020 we terminated our accounts receivable purchase arrangements in the us and japan which we estimate negatively impacted operating cash flows by approximately 300 million 

cash flows used in investing activities were 5036 million in 2021 compared to 6138 million and 7293 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively instrument and property plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network in order to preserve cash we prioritized investments in 2020 which resulted in lower investments in property plant and equipment as further discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we made various acquisitions in 2020 requiring initial cash outlays of 2355 million net of acquired cash 

cash flows used in financing activities were 13060 million in 2021 in 2021 we issued senior notes and received 15998 million in proceeds which along with cash on hand were used to extinguish 19932 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our senior notes pursuant to cash tender offers for certain outstanding series of our senior notes at a total reacquisition price of 21548 million additionally we used cash on hand to redeem 5000 million of other senior notes that matured in 2021 w e also had deferred business combination payments of 1450 million that were paid in 2021 under the terms of the purchase agreements 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4218 million in 2020 in 2020 we issued senior notes and received 14971 million in proceeds which were used to pay our 15000 million senior notes at maturity on april 1 2020 additionally with cash flows generated from operations in 2020 we redeemed 2500 million of our floating rate senior notes that matured on march 19 2021 further the termination of certain accounts receivable purchase arrangements in 2020 resulted in 546 million of financing cash outflows to the purchasing financial institutions these outflows represent the amount of unremitted cash that we had collected on sold accounts receivable as of december 31 2019 that was repaid in 2020   

 

 

 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2021 4502 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 580 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate we intend to repatriate 50 to 60 billion of unremitted earnings in future years

material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations

at december 31 2021 we had outstanding debt of 70688 million of which 16051 million was classified as current debt of our current debt 7500 million of senior notes mature on april 1 2022 2865 million of japanese yen denominated term loans mature on september 27 2022 and 5686 million of euro denominated senior notes mature on december 13 2022 we believe we can satisfy these debt obligations with cash generated from our operations cash received from the spinoff of zimvie by issuing new debt andor by borrowing on our revolving credit facilities we also estimate our interest payments will be 1630 million in 2022 and continue to decline annually thereafter assuming we continue to pay down our debt as it matures and incur no additional borrowings

for additional information on our debt including types of debt maturity dates interest rates debt covenants and available revolving credit facilities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

in february may august and december 2021 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date as of december 31 2021 all 10 billion remained authorized

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we have a 2021 restructuring plan and a 2019 restructuring plan the 2021 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 240 million of which approximately 30 million was incurred through december 31 2021 we expect to reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 210 million relative to the 2021 baseline expenses by the end of 2024 as program benefits under the 2021 restructuring plan are realized the 2019 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 350 million to 400 million of which approximately 225 million was incurred through december 31 2021 we expect to reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 200 million to 300 million relative to the 2019 baseline expenses by the end of 2023 as program benefits under the 2019 restructuring plan are realized

as discussed in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2010 through 2012 as well as proposed adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to vigorously defend our positions although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows 

 

under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we have a 2153 million liability remaining from a onetime tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits “toll charge” for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings this amount was recorded in noncurrent income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

as discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various litigation matters we estimate the total liabilities for all litigation matters was 4205 million as of december 31 2021 we expect to pay these liabilities over the next few years

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments primarily related to raw materials however we do not believe these purchase commitments are material to the overall standing of our business or our liquidity

 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product these estimated payments related to these agreements could range from 0 to 365 million

 

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of our financial statements is affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods and also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates and assumptions described below involve significant subjectivity and judgment and changes to such estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results

excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‑in‑process inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

commitments and contingencies  we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of doing business including litigation related to product labor and intellectual property we establish liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 

goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value is below its carrying amount we evaluate 

 

the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and riskadjusted discount rates  as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2021 all our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 percent fair value was determined using income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units significant assumptions are incorporated into the income approach such as estimated growth rates forecasted operating expenses and riskadjusted discount rates fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our reporting units 

future impairment in our reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline additionally changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates and comparable company valuation indicators which may impact our estimated fair values further changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase the cost of procuring inventory and services from foreign suppliers which could reduce reporting unit profitability 

as previously discussed we expect to spin off our spine and dental businesses effective march 1 2022 at the separation date we will be required to compare the carrying value of the assets disposed of in the spinoff to their fair value and recognize impairment if the assets’ carrying value exceeds their fair value this impairment test is different than the test performed while these assets are being held and used the impairment test while the assets are being held and used is an undiscounted cash flows recoverability test while the separation date test is done at fair value which may be estimated using discounted cash flows therefore the difference in impairment testing between assets being held and used and assets being disposed of could result in us recording an impairment charge at the separation date

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market risk

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes

foreign currency exchange risk

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings

 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2021  we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 202 2 throug h june 2024  the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2021 were 12952 million  the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2021 were 3470 million   

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2021 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened or weakened in value by 10 percent relative to all currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would affect earnings in a range of a decrease of approximately 98 million to an increase of approximately 91 million before income taxes in periods through june 2024

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 14428 million at december 31 2021 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one to three months to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements

commodity price risk

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 

interest rate risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

the majority of our debt is fixedrate debt and therefore is not exposed to changes in interest rates based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2021 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense net this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and accounts receivable

we place our cash and cash equivalents and enter into derivative transactions with highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents or derivative instruments

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints and price reduction initiatives to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

customers sales and marketing 

our primary customers include orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts and some healthcare dealers inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors some healthcare dealers and hospitals dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment consignment sales represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2020 no individual customer accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2020

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels 

we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical and dental procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through three operating segments our operating segments are comprised of americas and global businesses europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific the following is a summary of our operating segments see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments

 

americas and global businesses  the americas and global businesses operating segment is our largest operating segment this segment is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets for all of our product categories as well as the global results for our dental product s division this segment also includes our global manufacturing operations for all product categories and research development engineering medical education and brand management for our global product category headquarter locations  the us accounts for 9 5 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

in our dental products division our sales force is primarily composed of employees who market our products to customers we sell directly to dental practices or dental laboratories or to independent stocking distributors depending on the market 

emea   the emea operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for 57 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa this operating segment includes all product categories in these markets except for dental our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment 

asia pacific the asia pacific operating segment includes key markets such as japan china australia new zealand korea taiwan india thailand singapore hong kong and malaysia japan is the largest market within this segment accounting for 50 percent of the region’s sales this operating segment includes all product categories in these markets except for dental in japan and most countries in the asia pacific region we maintain a network of dealers who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region and sales associates who build and maintain relationships with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets the knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service product information and support to surgeons 

seasonality

our business is seasonal in nature to some extent as many of our products are used in elective procedures which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans additionally with sales to customers where title to product passes upon shipment these customers may purchase items in large quantities if incentives are offered or if there are new product offerings in a market which could cause periodtoperiod differences in sales due to the covid19 global pandemic the typical seasonal patterns did not occur in 2020

distribution

we distribute our products both through large centralized warehouses and through smaller market specific facilities depending on the needs of the market we maintain large centralized warehouses in the us and europe to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in those regions in addition to these centralized warehouses we maintain smaller distribution facilities in the us and in each of the countries where we have a direct sales presence in many locations our inventory is consigned to the healthcare institution

we generally ship our orders via expedited courier since most of our sales occur at the time of an elective procedure we generally do not have firm orders

products

our products include orthopedic reconstructive products sports medicine biologics extremities and trauma products office based technologies spine and cmft products dental implants and related surgical products 

 

knees 

total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articular surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime or primary joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis a developing trend in knee replacement surgeries is the use of robotic technologies to assist a surgeon with implant positioning in 2019 we entered the robotic assistance market with our rosa ® knee system in the future we plan to expand the use of our rosa ® robot to other product categories 

our significant knee brands include the following 









hips 

total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis acetabulum of the natural hip hip procedures include firsttime or primary joint replacement as well as revision procedures hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone or are pressfit into bone which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance

our operations products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the us our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex there is a global trend toward increased regulatory activity related to medical products

in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all 

 

aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda medical device classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are classified by fda regulation as exempt from premarket clearance and approval or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 

in january 2021 the fda announced a new “action plan” to address software as a medical device “samd” and artificial intelligence and machine learning “aiml” certain of our new products will likely incorporate innovations related to aiml and therefore we will monitor developments in this area closely to determine our compliance obligations and risks

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as requirements for advertising and promotion of our devices our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the qsr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or approval to market new and existing products and is also necessary for distributing in the us certain devices exempt from fda clearance and approval requirements the fda conducts announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form fda483 “form 483” that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products seizure of products and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us and can prevent the importation of products the fda deems to violate the fdca or its implementing regulations the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac” in 

 

addition exported medical products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported 

there are also requirements of state and local governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products

in many of the countries in which our products are sold we are subject to supranational national regional and local regulations affecting among other things the development design manufacturing product standards packaging advertising promotion labeling marketing and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices the member countries of the european union the “eu” have adopted the european medical device directive the “mdd” which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the mdd and certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the mdd we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in may 2017 a new eu medical device regulation “mdr” was published that will replace the mdd and will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the effective date for the mdr has been extended due to the covid19 pandemic with it currently scheduled to become effective in may 2021 under a corrigendum to the mdr finalized in december 2019 some lowrisk medical devices being upclassified as a result of the mdr including lowrisk instruments may now receive a transitional period to comply by may 2024

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 13485 the qsr the mdd and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our principal manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 and audited at regular intervals additionally our principal sites are certified under the medical device single audit program “mdsap” which is a voluntary audit program developed by regulatory authorities in five countries ie australia brazil canada japan and the united states to assess compliance with the quality management system regulatory requirements of those countries mdsap audits are conducted by an mdsaprecognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of the participating regulatory jurisdictions replacing standard surveillance audits by the regulatory authorities in those countries

further we are subject to other supranational national regional federal state and local laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical products manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the united kingdom “uk” bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj which concluded on february 9 2021 six months following certification to the doj and the us securities and exchange commission “sec” by an independent compliance monitor that our compliance program including its policies and procedures is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations of the fcpa and is functioning effectively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical 

 

devices the fda and the department of homeland security “dhs” have issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information the us department of health and human services “hhs” through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 10 2020 hhs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “npr” to modify the hipaa privacy rule the proposed modifications would remove communication barriers between providers and health plans allow individuals more access to their health information and impose new requirements on entities that receive patient data requests separately hhs through the national coordinator for health information technology issued a new rule to be effective april 5 2021 that seeks to limit “blocking” of electronic health information by imposing data access software licensing and interoperability requirements on healthcare providers and information technology vendors we intend to monitor both the npr and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which was signed into law on june 28 2018 and took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners a second law called the california privacy rights act “cpra” passed via a ballot referendum in november 2020 the cpra expands the scope of the ccpa imposes new restrictions on behavioral advertising and establishes a new california privacy protection agency which will enforce the law and issue regulations other states have considered andor enacted similar privacy laws we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigation and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business

outside of the us data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and member state implementing legislation and the brazil lei geral de proteção de dados the “lgpd” also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 imposes data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities

risks related to our business operations and strategy 

t he covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic pandemic or contagious diseases such as covid19 the global spread of covid‑19 has had and we expect it to continue to have an adverse impact on demand for our products our sales our operations our supply chains and distribution systems and our expenses including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments have taken and may continue to take due to these impacts and measures we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of covid19 during 2020 we experienced a significant decline in procedure volumes globally as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing covid19 and that decline has continued additionally public health bodies around the globe have at times recommended delaying elective surgeries during the covid19 pandemic and patients surgeons and medical societies are evaluating the risks of elective surgeries in the presence of infectious diseases which we expect will continue to negatively impact demand for our products and the number of procedures performed

as a result of the covid19 outbreak we have experienced significant business disruptions including restrictions on our ability to travel and to distribute our products temporary closures of or limited operations at certain of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and contract manufacturers as well as reduction in access to our customers due to diverted resources and priorities and the business hours of hospitals as governments institute prolonged shelterinplace andor selfquarantine mandates the unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and healthcare authorities globally including the deferral of elective surgical procedures and social distancing measures have had and we expect them to continue to have a significant adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows these disruptions have resulted in the following among other unfavorable outcomes 









 

 



if preventative and precautionary measures andor the distribution of vaccines do not curb the spread of covid19 our financial position results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely affected prolonged disruptions that cause deferral of elective surgical procedures may result in the following among other potential negative outcomes















in addition the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and we expect it to continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries which may result in a period of regional national and global economic slowdown or regional national or global recessions that could further negatively affect demand for our products as hospitals curtail or delay spending and individuals experiencing unemployment andor a loss of healthcare benefits cancel or delay elective procedures and could also increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase of our products due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity lack of funding operational failures or other reasons covid19 and the current financial economic and capital markets environment and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance financial condition volume of business results of operations and cash flows due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization we are unable to estimate the impacts on our operations and financial results

our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings andor operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives

in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a global restructuring program the “2019 restructuring plan” with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities which program is ongoing restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include or result in workforce reductions global plant closures andor consolidations product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiencies during transitional periods restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements andor cost reductions or otherwise harm our business including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program as well as management distraction for more information on our restructuring program see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner

 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions

our acquisitions involve numerous risks including















as a result if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions

the proposed spinoff of our spine and dental businesses may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all and may not achieve the intended results

on february 5 2021 we announced our intention to pursue a plan to spin off our spine and dental businesses to form a new and independent publicly traded company “newco” through a taxfree distribution to our stockholders of publicly traded stock in newco we are targeting completion of the spinoff in mid2022 unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spinoff including but not limited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory tax and works council approvals or clearances in addition consummation of the proposed spinoff is subject to certain conditions including among others final approval of our board of directors the receipt of a favorable opinion and internal revenue service “irs” ruling with respect to the taxfree nature of the transaction and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the sec therefore we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced or at all

we will incur significant expenses in connection with the spinoff in addition completion of the proposed spinoff will require significant amounts of management’s time and effort which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations the spinoff will also require modifications to our systems and processes used to operate our business we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations following the spinoff we will be a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could adversely affect our operating results we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the spinoff and following its completion which could harm our business

further if the spinoff is completed the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction strategic and competitive advantages of each company and future growth and other opportunities for each company may not be realized within the expected time periods or at all  failure to implement the spinoff effectively could also result in a lower value to our company and our stockholders 

the proposed spinoff may result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners

parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the spinoff including with respect to current or future business relationships with us our business relationships may be subject to disruption as 

 

customers vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could adversely affect our business including adversely affecting our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the spinoff 

the spinoff could result in substantial tax liability

we intend to obtain an opinion and an irs ruling as to the taxfree nature of the spinoff under the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the opinion and ruling will be based among other things on various factual assumptions and representations we will make if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized if the spinoff does not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes the resulting tax liability to us and to newco stockholders could be substantial 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events vulnerabilities in our technology cyberattacks against our information systems or the information systems of our business partners such as ransomware attacks or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty suppliers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products  such as due to one or more suppliers experiencing reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics  an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide or reductions in operations andor worker absences due to the covid19 pandemic or other health epidemics we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our 

 

due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities in addition some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information of patients employees and customers collectively “confidential information” 

our information systems and those of thirdparty suppliers with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards changing threats and vulnerabilities and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty vendors andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information 

like other large multinational corporations we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future we also are subject to other cyberattacks including statesponsored cyberattacks industrial espionage insider threats computer denialofservice attacks computer viruses ransomware and other malware payment fraud or other cyber incidents in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic a significant number of our employees who are able to work remotely are doing so and malicious cyber actors may increase malware campaigns and phishing emails targeting teleworkers preying on the uncertainties surrounding covid19 which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks our incident response efforts business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could























while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents however cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive therefore despite our efforts we cannot assure that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation

 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of













in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including







our competitors may











any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of















without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to







 

 











in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors







moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels or change reimbursement models for hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products including through political changes or transitions our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

 

financial credit and liquidity risks 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations and the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor andor other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions at december 31 2020 our total indebtedness was 81 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014  as of december 31 2020 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 07 billion as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things

















in addition the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate “libor” euro interbank offered rate “ euribor” andor tokyo interbank offered rate “tibor” any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows further in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates to the ice benchmark administration limited together with any successor “iba” in response to concerns regarding the future of libor the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” to identify alternatives to libor the arrc has recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against libor’s discontinuation the initial steps in the arrc’s recommended provision reference variations of the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” in november 2020 the iba announced a proposal that the cessation date for the submission and publication of certain tenors of us dollar denominated libor including one three six and twelvemonth libor be extended to june 30 2023 at this time it is not possible to predict whether sofr will attain market traction as a libor replacement and it remains uncertain if libor in applicable tenors and applicable currencies will cease to exist after calendar year 2021 or whether additional reforms to libor may be enacted or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for libor further other central banks have convened working groups to determine replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks such as euribor and it is expected although not known that a transition away from the use of certain of these other interest rate benchmarks will occur over the course of the next few years and alternative reference rates such as the euro shortterm rate €str will be established or gain market acceptance 

certain of our debt obligations that are based on libor will mature before the end of 2021 h owever the revolving credit agreement that we entered into on november 1 2019 the “2019 credit agreement” has an initial maturity date of november 1 2024 in anticipation of libor’s phase out the 2019 credit agreement provides for alternative base rates as well as a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the general administrative agent and our lenders there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates if at all we will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur accordingly the potential effect of the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as euribor or tibor on our cost of capital cannot yet 

 

be determined further the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense for example changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes as adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

the results of the us presidential election could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact our effective tax rate 

prior to the recent us presidential election president biden proposed an increase in the us corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 increasing the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries imposition of an offshoring tax penalty and a 15 minimum tax on worldwide book income if any or all of these or similar proposals are ultimately enacted into law in whole or in part they could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our independent agents and distributors are characterized as employees we would be subject to additional tax and other liabilities

we structure our relationships with independent agents and distributors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship not an employee relationship although we believe that our independent agents and distributors are properly characterized as independent contractors tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships further we have been subject to lawsuits challenging the characterization of these relationships in recent years changes in classification from independent contractor to employee can result in a change to various requirements associated with the payment of wages tax withholding and the provision of unemployment health and other traditional employeremployee related benefits if regulatory authorities or state federal or foreign courts were to determine that our independent agents or distributors are employees and not independent contractors we would be required to withhold income taxes to withhold and pay social security medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes we would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties as a result any determination that our independent agents and distributors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results

goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets at december 31 2020 we had 93 billion in goodwill and 71 billion of intangible assets the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 6120 million as a result of the adverse impacts from the covid19 pandemic and a change in our reportable segments and in the second quarter of 2020 we recorded 330 million of inprocess research and development “iprd” intangible asset impairments on certain iprd projects  if the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels including if elective surgical procedures are deferred longer than our current expectations due to the covid19 pandemic if 

 

competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units we could be required to record additional impairment charges any writeoff of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

global operational risks 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2020 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including





























violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the japanese yen the swiss franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us further if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions

developments relating to the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect us

the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and entered into a transition period which ended on december 31 2020 the “transition period” during which terms for the future trading relationship between the eu and uk were negotiated on december 30 2020 the uk and the eu signed the ukeu trade and cooperation agreement which applies provisionally pending ratification by the council of the european union with effect from the end of the transition period as of the end of the transition period the uk and the eu became separate and distinct legal and regulatory jurisdictions

 

brexit has resulted in certain new restrictions on the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu  through technical barriers to trade  rules of origin requirements custom inspections andor migration restrictions in terms of medical products regulation and trade the now separate uk and eu approval and regulatory regimes may in the near term or over time require us to make adjustments to our business and operations that could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete over time brexit could also result in increasing regulatory andor standards divergence between the uk and the eu  which could affect the clearance and approval of medical products in each or either jurisdiction  

despite the ukeu trade and cooperation agreement brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in the uk europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets 

given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit remains uncertain any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development design product standards packaging advertising promotion postmarket surveillance manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex the products we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other supranational national federal regional state and local governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other supranational national federal regional state and local requirements globally compliance with these requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators which may result in observations such as on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk they could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us andor recommend prosecution any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

in august 2018 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility as of february 14 2021 this warning letter remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements

governmental regulations outside the us continue to become increasingly stringent and complex in the eu for example the mdr is expected to become effective in may 2021 and will include significant additional premarket and post market requirements complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense additionally the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited 

 

which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the mdr any such delays or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the false claims act the antikickback statute the stark law the physician payments sunshine act the food drug and cosmetic act and similar laws and regulations in the us and around the world in addition we are subject to various laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters including the fcpa sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices the fda and the dhs have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under hipaa hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information hhs through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 10 2020 hhs issued an npr to modify the hipaa privacy rule separately hhs through the national coordinator for health information technology issued a new rule to be effective april 5 2021 that will limit “blocking” of electronic health information we intend to monitor both the npr and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other personal information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners a second law in california the cpra passed via a ballot referendum in november 2020 the cpra expands the scope of the ccpa and establishes a new california privacy protection agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations the cpra is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 1 2022 other states have considered andor enacted similar privacy laws we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigations and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business 

outside of the us data protection laws including the gdpr in europe and the lgpd in brazil also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr imposes among other things data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and 

 

supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks 

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include substantial civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the ml taper and ml taper with kinectiv ® technology hip stems and versys ® femoral head implants and the m2amagnum tm hip system we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as previously disclosed in march 2019 we paid approximately 168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys’ fees in a patent infringement lawsuit

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology processes methodologies and information we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure license assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish maintain and protect our proprietary rights as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license however the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 

in addition intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in particular a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible we may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct to prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property we might be required to engage in costly and timeconsuming litigation or other proceedings 

 

and we may not ultimately prevail any failure to establish maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements there have been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and insider trading based on allegations that we made materially false andor misleading statements andor omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016  although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period

risks related to our organizational documents and jurisdiction of incorporation 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 









these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in 

 

respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

executive level overview

impact of the covid19 global pandemic 

our results have been significantly impacted by the covid19 global pandemic the vast majority of our net sales are derived from products used in elective surgical procedures as covid19 rapidly started to spread throughout the world in early 2020 our net sales decreased dramatically as countries took precautions to prevent the spread of the virus with lockdowns and stayathome measures and as hospitals deferred elective surgical procedures this resulted in net sales declines of 97 percent and 383 percent in the first and second quarters of 2020 respectively when compared to the same prior year periods in the third quarter of 2020 various levels of recovery in elective surgical procedures occurred resulting in net sales growth of 20 percent when compared to the same prior year period however in the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw the pandemic worsen and elective surgical procedures were deferred again especially late in the quarter this was particularly prevalent in emea as a result our net sales declined in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 19 percent when compared to the same prior year period

with the deferral of elective surgical procedures we have taken prudent measures in an effort to maintain an adequate financial profile to have access to capital to fund the business during these unprecedented times in response to the covid19 pandemic we have temporarily reduced discretionary spending such as travel meetings and other project spend that can be delayed with limited longterm detriment to the business and we have temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities however to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain or in our ability to meet our customer demands

2020 financial highlights 

in 2020 our net sales decreased by 120 percent compared to 2019 due to the deferral of elective surgical procedures from the covid19 pandemic we recognized a net loss of 1389 million in the year ended december 31 2020 the loss was largely attributable to the impacts of covid19 which caused lower net sales and was the primary driver behind 6450 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges the temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities resulted in higher costs of products sold that relate to certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses that are included in the cost of inventory when these facilities are operating at normal capacity pursuant to our 2019 restructuring plan we also incurred higher restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses in 2020 when compared to 2019 lastly in 2020 we recognized net litigationrelated charges of 1598 million compared to net litigationrelated charges of 415 million in 2019 these unfavorable items were partially offset by savings from our 2019 restructuring plan and lower costs for travel meetings and other projects due to covid19 

2021 outlook 

we believe the covid19 surges that occurred late in 2020 will continue to negatively impact our net sales in 2021 however at this time we are optimistic the rollout of vaccines around the world will change those dynamics and elective surgical procedures will be able to return to prepandemic levels at some point during 2021 additionally since the clinical need for many of our products does not go away it is possible once patients and hospitals have confidence to return to elective surgical procedures the patient backlog from deferred procedures may have a positive effect on the underlying market growth however the consequences of covid19 continue to be fluid and it is difficult to predict its ongoing impacts to our business and broader economic and market environments

if the negative impacts of covid19 on our net sales subsides we believe we can improve our operating profit margin since our fixed costs would not increase proportionally to net sales 

 

results of operations 

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set dental spine  cmft and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

net sales by geography

the following tables present net sales by geography and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

 



 



 

“foreign exchange” used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales

the following table presents net sales by product category by geography for our knees and hips product categories which represent our most significant product categories dollars in millions 

 



 

 

demand volumemix trends 

changes in volume and mix of product sales had a negative effect of 100 percent on yearoveryear sales during the year ended december 31 2020 volume trends were negative in the first and second quarters of 2020 as the covid19 pandemic resulted in the deferral of elective surgical procedures in the third quarter of 2020 we experienced various levels of recovery in elective surgical procedures resulting in positive volume and mix compared to the same prior year period however in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the pandemic surged volume trends again were negative compared to the same prior year period in many regions and we expect this trend to continue into 2021 until vaccines or other preventative measures lessen the spread of infection and patient reluctance

based upon country dynamics volume changes varied by region in 2020 in the americas the us volume trends varied from statetostate depending on local infection rates and preventative measures in emea stayathome measures were far more prevalent than other geographies especially in the second and fourth quarters resulting in emea volume and mix trends being the worst among our geographic regions for the full year in asia pacific containment of the covid19 virus varied from countrytocountry but overall volume and mix trends were positive in asia pacific in the second half of 2020 as our three largest markets of japan china and australianew zealand all had sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020    

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 24 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2020 in the majority of countries in which we operate we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2020 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of 04 percent on yearoveryear sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates we estimate they will have a less than 1 percent positive effect on sales in 2021 for the full year 

 

estimated market trends 

the following table presents estimated 2020 global market information dollars in billions

 



 







expenses as a percent of net sales

 



 

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization

we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2020 and 2019 compared to the prior year

 



 

 

 

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to temporarily suspended or limited production at certain facilities intangible asset amortization lower average selling prices excess and obsolete inventory charges and charges related to products we intend to discontinue the temporary suspension or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities resulted in us immediately expensing certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses that are included in the cost of inventory when these facilities are operating at normal capacity intangible asset amortization and excess and obsolete inventory charges did not decline ratably with the significant decline in our net sales and therefore were a significant impact to our gross margin percentage the inventory charges on discontinued products are driven by overlapping product lines in our portfolio and we have plans to discontinue one of the product lines or from decisions not to spend additional funds to keep certain products uptodate with the latest quality standards or requirements such as the european union medical device regulation “eu mdr” and so we have decided to discontinue those products 

 

operating expenses

research  development “rd” expenses decreased in both amount and as a percentage of net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to savings as a result of the 2019 restructuring plan and lower spending on travel and lower spending on certain project costs including the eu mdr due to covid19

selling general  administrative “sga” expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 but increased as a percentage of net sales sga expenses decreased due to lower variable selling and distribution expenses from the decline in our net sales covid19 cost reductions for travel consulting and other projects savings from our 2019 restructuring plan and lower charges related to our compliance with the dpa these favorable items were partially offset by higher litigationrelated charges in 2020 compared to 2019 see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these litigation matters the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales is due to various fixed expenses that did not decline ratably with the significant decline in our net sales 

in 2020 we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 6450 million including charges of 4700 million and 1420 million related to our emea and dental reporting units respectively and 330 million of intangible asset impairment charges in 2019 we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of 701 million for more information regarding these charges see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements

in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated the 2019 restructuring plan with an overall objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities we recognized expenses of 1169 million and 500 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively attributable to restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives primarily related to employee termination benefits distributor contract terminations and consulting and project management expenses associated with the 2019 restructuring plan for more information regarding these expenses see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

our quality remediation expenses declined in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the natural regression of completing our remediation milestones acquisition integration and related expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the various acquisitions we made in 2020 

on february 5 2021 we announced our intention to pursue a plan to spin off our spine and dental businesses to form newco we expect to incur significant expenses in 2021 to execute this plan the significant expenses primarily include third party consulting and project management to help us separate the legacy zimmer biomet and newco businesses and to comply with all the necessary actions needed for newco to become an independent publiclytraded company consummation of the proposed spinoff is subject to certain conditions including final approval of our board of directors the receipt of a favorable opinion and irs ruling with respect to the taxfree nature of the transaction and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the sec therefore we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced or at all

other income expense net interest expense net and income taxes

in 2020 we recognized income in other income expense net compared to net expenses in 2019 primarily due to gains recognized from changes to the fair value of our equity investments and higher gains from certain components of pension expense in 2020 

interest expense net declined in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower average outstanding debt balances during 2020 resulting from debt repayments throughout 2019 and euro notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2019 that were used to refinance debt with higher interest rates despite continued debt repayments our interest expense net may 

 

increase in 2021 due to crosscurrency interest rate swaps that will mature in 2021 based upon current market conditions if we decide to enter into new swaps when the previous swaps mature in 2021 the new swaps would not be as favorable to us compared to the maturing swaps 

 

our effective tax rate “etr” on loss earnings before income taxes was 499 percent and negative 249 percent a tax benefit was recognized on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 the income tax benefit was driven by changes in estimates to uncertain tax positions favorable tax audit settlements jurisdictional mix of earnings and losses and a 430 million tax benefit from switzerland’s federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “traf” other significant impacts to the etr in 2020 included the 6120 million goodwill impairment charge which resulted in a loss before taxes but had no corresponding tax benefit 

 

in 2019 we recognized an overall tax benefit in the year due to a 3150 million benefit from switzerland’s traf in addition to the tax impact of certain restructuring transactions in switzerland the traf was effective january 1 2020 and includes the abolishment of various favorable federal and cantonal tax regimes the traf provided transitional relief measures for companies that are losing the tax benefit of a ruling including a stepup for amortizable goodwill equal to the amount of future tax benefit they would have received under their existing ruling subject to certain limitations 

 

absent discrete tax events we expect our future etr will be lower than the us corporate income tax rate of 210 percent due to our mix of earnings between us and foreign locations which have lower corporate income tax rates our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pretax earnings changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit

 



in 2020 the net sales and operating profit of all of our operating segments were adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the operating profit as a percentage of net sales for each of our segments declined compared to prior years due to the effect of fixed operating expenses that did not decline proportionally with lower net sales from the impact of covid19

nongaap operating performance measures

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude as applicable certain inventory and manufacturingrelated charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines intangible asset amortization goodwill and intangible asset impairment restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses quality remediation expenses acquisition integration and related expenses certain litigation gains and charges expenses to establish initial compliance with the eu mdr other charges any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” the effect of switzerland tax reform other certain tax adjustments and with respect to earnings per share information provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business additionally we believe these nongaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance we believe these measures offer the ability to make periodtoperiod comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations the nongaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend 

 

analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the nongaap measures in addition adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs  

 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts 

 



 

 



 



 

























 







 



 

 

liquidity and capital resources

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resource needs primarily driven by the reduction in net sales due to elective surgical procedure deferrals we have taken prudent measures in an effort to maintain an adequate financial profile and to have access to capital to fund the business during these unprecedented times these measures included reductions to discretionary spending such as travel meetings and other project spend that can be delayed with limited longterm detriment to the business however we continued to incur fixed expenses that resulted in lower operating cash flows in 2020 when compared to 2019

as of december 31 2020 we had 8021 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition we had 10 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit agreement entered into on september 18 2020 the “september 2020 credit agreement” that contains a 10 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility the “september 2020 revolving facility” and matures on september 17 2021 and 15 billion available under our fiveyear unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of 15 billion the “2019 multicurrency revolving facility” under the revolving credit agreement we entered into on november 1 2019 the “2019 credit agreement” that will mature on november 1 2024 the terms of the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility and the september 2020 revolving facility collectively the “revolving facilities” are described further below and in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

based on the actions described above we believe that cash flows from operations our cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowings under our revolving facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months at this time we do not anticipate needing to borrow against our revolving facilities to fund our operations however due to the significant uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic it is possible our needs may change further there can be no assurance that if needed we will be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

sources of liquidity

cash flows provided by operating activities were 12045 million in 2020 compared to 15858 million and 17474 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively the decline in cash flow from operating activities in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of covid19 reducing our cash inflows due to lower net sales while we continued to pay many fixed operating costs additionally in 2020 we terminated our accounts receivable purchase arrangements in the us and japan which we estimate negatively impacted operating cash flows by approximately 300 million the 2019 period included a payment of approximately 168 million on a patent infringement lawsuit 

cash flows used in investing activities were 6138 million in 2020 compared to 7293 million and 4166 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively instrument and property plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network in order to preserve cash we prioritized investments in 2020 which resulted in lower investments in property plant and equipment totaling 1175 million when compared to 2071 million in 2019 as further discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we made various acquisitions in 2020 requiring initial cash outlays of 2355 million net of acquired cash in 2019 we paid 1976 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from third parties 

 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4218 million in 2020  in 2020 we issued senior notes and received 14971 million in proceeds which were used to pay our 15000 million senior notes at maturity on april 1 2020 additionally with cash flows generated from operations in 2020 we prepaid 2500 million of our floating rate senior notes that mature march 19 2021 further the termination of certain accounts receivable purchase arrangements in 2020 resulted in 546 million of financing cash outflows to the purchasing financial institutions these outflows represent the amount of unremitted cash that we had collected on sold accounts receivable as of december 31 2019 that was repaid in 2020 cash flows used in financing activities were 7799 million in 2019 our primary use of available cash in 2019 was for debt repayment we received net proceeds of 5492 million from the issuance of additional eurodenominated senior notes which we used to repay 5000 million of senior notes that became due on november 30 2019 in january 2019 we borrowed an additional 2000 million under a us term loan “us term loan c” and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repay the remaining 2250 million outstanding under the us term loan “us term loan b” provided for under our 2016 credit agreement during 2019 we also repaid the 7350 million outstanding balance under us term loan c with the remainder of the proceeds from the eurodenominated senior notes issuance and cash from operations overall we had approximately 710 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2019  

at december 31 2020 we had outstanding debt of 81265 million of which 5000 million was classified as current debt as it relates to our current debt following december 31 2020 we prepaid the remaining 2000 million principal amount outstanding on our floating rate senior notes due march 19 2021 the remaining current debt consists of our 3000 million senior notes due november 30 2021 we believe we can satisfy this debt obligation with cash generated from our operations by issuing new debt andor by borrowing on our revolving credit facilities 

for additional information on our debt including types of debt maturity dates interest rates debt covenants and available revolving credit facilities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2020 3901 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 908 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate we intend to repatriate at least 55 billion of unremitted earnings in future years

in february june september and december 2020 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date as of december 31 2020 all 10 billion remained authorized

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated the 2019 restructuring plan with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities the 2019 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 350 million to 400 million 145 million of which was incurred through december 31 2020 we expect to reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 200 million to 300 million by the end of 2023 as program benefits under the 2019 restructuring plan are realized

as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we completed the acquisitions of ae medical corporation and relign corp in 2020 these acquisitions included guaranteed deferred payments totaling 1450 million that we are obligated to make in 2021 

as discussed in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2010 through 2012 as well as proposed adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to vigorously defend our positions although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows 

as discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various litigation matters with respect to which we expect to continue paying settlements over the next few years 

 

 

contractual obligations

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and certain other commitments in millions

 



 

1244 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2020 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2021 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

 

under the 2017 tax act we have a 2792 million liability remaining from a onetime tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits “toll charge” for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings this amount was recorded in noncurrent income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years

 

also included in longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these estimated payments could range from 0 to 380 million

critical accounting estimates

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below

 

excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work ‑in ‑process inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

commitments and contingencies  we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of doing business including litigation related to product labor and intellectual property we establish liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 

goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and riskadjusted discount rates  as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020 all our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 percent fair value was determined using income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units significant assumptions are incorporated into the income approach such as estimated growth rates and riskadjusted discount rates fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our reporting units 

future impairment in our reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline additionally changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates and comparable company valuation indicators which may impact our estimated fair values 

 

further  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase the cost of procuring inventory and services from foreign suppliers  which could reduce reporting unit profitability

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market risk

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes

foreign currency exchange risk

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2021 through june 2023 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2020 were 16059 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2020 were 2838 million 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened in value by 10 percent relative to all currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2023 by approximately 550 million

 

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 13690 million at december 31 2020 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements

commodity price risk

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

interest rate risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

the majority of our debt is fixedrate debt and therefore is not exposed to changes in interest rates based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2020 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense net this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and accounts receivable

we place our cash and cash equivalents and enter into derivative transactions with highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents or derivative instruments

 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

customers sales and marketing 

our primary customers include orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts and some healthcare dealers inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors some healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment consignment sales represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2019 no individual customer accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2019

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels 

we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical and dental procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units we are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons including the distribution channels through which products are sold our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product categories whereas our geographic operating segments have 

 

distribution channels that sell multiple product categories the following is a summary of our seven operating segments see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments 

americas the americas geographic operating segment is our largest operating segment the us accounts for 94 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

in the americas we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital 

emea   the emea geographic operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for 55 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment 

asia pacific the asia pacific geographic operating segment includes key markets such as japan china australia new zealand korea taiwan india thailand singapore hong kong and malaysia japan is the largest market within this segment accounting for 47 percent of the region’s sales in japan and most countries in the asia pacific region we maintain a network of dealers who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region and sales associates who build and maintain relationships with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets the knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service product information and support to surgeons 

spine less asia pacific “spine” the spine product category operating segment includes all spine product results except those in asia pacific the us accounts for the majority of sales in this operating segment the market dynamics of the spine business are similar to those described in the geographic operating segments however our spine business maintains a separate sales force of employees and independent sales agents 

office based technologies  our office based technologies product category operating segment only sells to us customers in this product category we market our products to doctors who prescribe them for use by patients the products are mostly provided directly by zimmer biomet to patients and are paid for through patients’ insurance or by patients themselves products are also sold through wholesale channels on a limited basis 

craniomaxillofacial and thoracic “cmf”  our cmf product category operating segment competes across the world through a combination of direct and independent sales agents the us accounts for the majority of sales in this operating segment the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents internationally our primary customers are independent stocking distributors who market our products to their customers 

dental  our dental product category operating segment competes across the world our sales force is primarily composed of employees who market our products to customers we sell directly to dental practices or dental laboratories or to independent stocking distributors depending on the market 

seasonality

our business is seasonal in nature to some extent as many of our products are used in elective procedures which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans additionally with sales to customers where title to product passes upon 

 

shipment these customers may purchase items in large quantities if incentives are offered or if there are new product offerings in a market which could cause periodtoperiod differences in sales 

distribution

we distribute our products both through large centralized warehouses and through smaller market specific facilities depending on the needs of the market we maintain large centralized warehouses in the us and europe to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in those regions in addition to these centralized warehouses we maintain smaller distribution facilities in the us and in each of the countries where we have a direct sales presence in many locations our inventory is consigned to the healthcare institution

we generally ship our orders via expedited courier since most of our sales occur at the time of an elective procedure we generally do not have firm orders

research and development

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques including robotic techniques materials biologics and product designs the research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials biologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth

we are broadening our offerings in certain of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places canada china france switzerland and other us locations as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 2100 research and development employees worldwide

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance

our operations products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the us our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex there is a global trend toward increased regulatory activity related to medical products

in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public

most of our new products fall into an fda medical device classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are classified by fda regulation as exempt from premarket clearance and approval or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as requirements for advertising and promotion of our devices our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the qsr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr 

 

compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or approval to market new and existing products and is also necessary for distributing in the us certain devices exempt from fda clearance and approval requirements the fda conducts announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form fda483 “form 483” that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products seizure of products and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us and can prevent the importation of products the fda deems to violate the fdca or its implementing regulations the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac” in addition exported medical products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported

there are also requirements of state and local governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products

in many of the countries in which our products are sold we are subject to supranational national regional and local regulations affecting among other things the development design manufacturing product standards packaging advertising promotion labeling marketing and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices the member countries of the european union the “eu” have adopted the european medical device directive the “mdd” which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the mdd and certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the mdd we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in may 2017 a new eu medical device regulation “mdr” was published that will replace the mdd and will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements beginning in may 2020 under a corrigendum to the mdr finalized in december 2019 some lowrisk medical devices being upclassified as a result of the mdr including lowrisk instruments may now receive a fouryear transitional period to comply

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 13485 the qsr the mdd and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our principal manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 and audited at regular intervals additionally our principal sites are certified under the medical device single audit program “mdsap” which is a voluntary audit program developed by regulatory authorities in five countries ie australia brazil canada japan and the united states to assess compliance with the quality management system regulatory requirements of those countries mdsap audits are conducted by an mdsaprecognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of the participating regulatory jurisdictions replacing standard surveillance audits by the regulatory authorities in those countries

further we are subject to other supranational national regional federal state and local laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical products manufacturers in recent years violations of 

 

these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the united kingdom “uk” bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj for information regarding the dpa see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices the fda and the department of homeland security “dhs” have issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information the us department of health and human services “hhs” through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 12 2018 the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which was signed into law on june 28 2018 and largely took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners regulations from the california attorney general have not been finalized and it is expected that additional amendments to the ccpa will be introduced meanwhile a number of other states have considered privacy laws like the ccpa and in october 2019 nevada enacted a similar but generally less restrictive privacy law we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigation and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business

outside of the us data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and member state implementing legislation and the brazil lei geral de proteção de dados the “lgpd” also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 imposes among other things data protection requirements that include 

 

strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year  

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to in‑source and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

in most of our manufacturing network we have improved our manufacturing processes to harmonize and optimize our quality systems and to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities

if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017 we may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs

on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of the settlement we entered into a dpa with the doj a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report

if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa which conduct predated our acquisition of biomet as well as any new or continuing violations we could also be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings andor operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives

in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a new global restructuring program that includes a restructuring of key businesses to better align our resources with our growth strategies achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs simplify our organizational structure accelerate decisionmaking and allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include or result in workforce reductions global plant closures andor consolidations product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiencies during transitional periods restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements andor cost reductions or otherwise harm our business including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program as well as management distraction for more information on our restructuring program see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions 

our acquisitions involve numerous risks including















as a result if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events vulnerabilities in our technology cyberattacks against our information systems such as ransomware attacks or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty suppliers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers 

 

sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development design product standards packaging advertising promotion postmarket surveillance manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent unpredictable and complex the products we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other supranational national federal regional state and local governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other supranational national federal regional state and local requirements globally compliance with these requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators which may result in observations such as on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk they could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us andor recommend prosecution any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility in august 2018 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility as of february 14 2020 these warning letters remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements

governmental regulations outside the us continue to become increasingly stringent and complex in the eu for example the mdr will become effective in may 2020 and will include significant additional premarket and post market requirements complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense additionally the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the mdr any such delays or any failure to meet the 

 

requirements of the new regulation could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the false claims act the antikickback statute the stark law the physician payments sunshine act the food drug and cosmetic act and similar laws and regulations in the us and around the world in addition we are subject to various laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters including the fcpa sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices the fda and the dhs have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices 

in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy security and breach notification regulations promulgated under hipaa hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information hhs through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 12 2018 the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure transfer storage disposal and protection of personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws for example several us territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals and at times regulators the media or credit reporting agencies if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information other state laws include the ccpa which was signed into law on june 28 2018 and largely took effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners regulations from the california attorney general have not been finalized and it is expected that additional amendments to the ccpa will be introduced meanwhile over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the ccpa and in october 2019 nevada enacted a similar but generally less restrictive privacy law we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws which may impose substantial penalties for violations impose significant costs for investigations and compliance allow private classaction litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business 

outside of the us data protection laws including the gdpr and lgpd also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr imposes among other 

 

things data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4 of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks 

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include substantial civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations and the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor andor other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions at december 31 2019 our total indebtedness was 82 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014  as of december 31 2019 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 17 billion as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things

















in addition the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate “libor” euro interbank offered rate “ euribor” andor tokyo interbank offered rate “tibor” any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows further in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in response to concerns regarding the future of libor the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” to identify alternatives to libor the arrc has recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against libor’s discontinuation the initial steps in the arrc’s recommended provision reference variations of the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” at this time it is not possible to predict whether sofr will attain market traction as a libor replacement additionally it is uncertain if libor will cease to exist after calendar year 2021 or whether additional reforms to libor may be enacted or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for libor further other central banks have convened working groups to determine replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks such as euribor and it is expected although not known that a transition away from the use of certain of these other interest rate benchmarks will occur over the course of the next few years and alternative reference rates will be established 

 

certain of our debt obligations that are based on libor will mature before the end of 2021 however the revolving credit agreement that we entered into on november 1 2019 the “2019 credit agreement” has an initial maturity date of november 1 2024 in anticipation of libor’s phase out the 2019 credit agreement provides for alternative base rates as well as a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the general administrative agent and our lenders there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates if at all we will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur accordingly the potential effect of the phaseout replacement or unavailability of libor or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as euribor or tibor on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined further the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities in addition some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information of patients employees and customers collectively “confidential information” 

our information systems and those of thirdparty suppliers with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty suppliers andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information 

like other large multinational corporations we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future we also are subject to other cyberattacks including statesponsored cyberattacks industrial espionage insider threats computer denialofservice attacks computer viruses ransomware and other malware payment fraud or other cyber incidents our incident response efforts business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could





















 



while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents however cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive therefore despite our efforts we cannot assure that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of













in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including







our competitors may











any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of















without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to

















in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors







moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products

 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2019 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including





























violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation

 

we have significant global sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics that could impact our sales and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan hubei province china  any outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operations these could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers the deferral of elective procedures in impacted countries or the temporary suspension of operations by us or our suppliers or customers any disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results in addition a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results

we may have additional tax liabilities

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law on december 22 2017 the “2017 tax act” with significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system our tax expense and cash flow could be impacted in the event of adverse future regulatory guidance provided by the us treasury clarifying certain aspects of the 2017 tax act or other changes to the us corporate income tax system

other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense for example changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes as adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the japanese yen the swiss franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us further if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in 

 

note 20 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “ durom cup” certain products within the ml taper and ml taper with kinectiv ® technology hip stems and versys ® femoral head implants and the m2amagnum tm hip system we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as discussed further in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in 2015 we paid a compensatory damages award of approximately 90 million and in march 2019 we paid approximately 168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys’ fees in a patent infringement lawsuit

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology processes methodologies and information we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure license assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish maintain and protect our proprietary rights as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license however the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 

in addition intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in particular a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible we may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct to prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property we might be required to engage in costly and timeconsuming litigation or other proceedings and we may not ultimately prevail any failure to establish maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending a purported class action lawsuit shah v zimmer biomet holdings inc et al filed against us certain of our current and former officers certain current and former members of our board of directors and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging that we and other defendants violated federal securities laws by making materially false andor misleading statements andor omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016 there have also been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging breaches of fiduciary duties 

 

and insider trading based on substantially the same factual allegations as shah although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results

goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets at december 31 2019 we had 96 billion in goodwill and 73 billion of intangible assets the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable as discussed further in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 9759 million in 2018 if the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units we could be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges any writeoff of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations

developments relating to the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect us

the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which voters chose to leave the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” following a protracted period of negotiation the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 after the ratification and approval of a withdrawal agreement by the eu and the uk the withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until december 31 2020 the “transition period” during which the terms of the future trading relationship between the eu and the uk will be negotiated throughout the transition period the legal and regulatory framework as between the uk and the eu will remain the same

brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets both during and after the transition period brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu through the imposition of tariffs custom inspections andor migration restrictions the future relationship for medical products regulation and trade between the uk and the eu is currently uncertain and any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete brexit could also result in the uk or the eu significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance and approval of medical products in addition as a result of brexit other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu if there is no agreed upon longterm trading arrangement by the end of the transition period a socalled “hard brexit” it would likely have a significant adverse impact on labor and trade and create significant shortterm currency volatility 

given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit is uncertain any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

 

these provisions provide for among other things 









these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

executive level overview

2019 financial highlights 

in 2019 our net sales increased by 06 percent compared to 2018 we estimate changes in volumemix of our products and pricing had a positive effect of 22 percent on our 2019 sales while changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 16 percent notably our sales growth was higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year primarily due to various product launches in our knees product category which drove improved commercial execution the improved second half performance was present in all of our product categories and geographic regions additionally the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was less in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half 

our net earnings increased by more than 15 billion in 2019 from 2018 we had significant goodwill and intangible asset impairments and litigationrelated charges in 2018 which contributed to a net loss that year in 2019 expenses related to quality remediation as well as acquisition and integration declined due to the continued progress in completing those projects higher sales lower interest expense and the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to switzerland tax reform resulted in the significant increase in earnings in 2019 compared to 2018 

2020 outlook 

we believe that the improved sales performance in the second half of 2019 will continue into 2020 we estimate sales growth in 2020 compared to 2019 will be in a range of 25 percent to 35 percent we anticipate the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be minimal for 2020 we expect to be able to leverage the sales growth into higher operating profits additionally we expect reductions in quality remediation costs as well as other various project costs as we complete these initiatives we have recently initiated restructuring activities designed to reduce our operating costs in the longterm these activities are expected to result in expenses of approximately 350 million to 400 million through the end of 2023 with slightly more than half of that expected to be incurred in 2020 further we expect interest expense net will continue to decline in 2020 due to lower average outstanding debt balances 

our 2020 outlook does not consider any impacts from the recent outbreak of the coronavirus while there could be a nearterm effect on our operating results it is difficult to assess or predict how material the impact will be and what longterm effects the outbreak may have 

results of operations

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set dental spine  cmf and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

 

 

net sales by geography 

the following tables present net sales by geography and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

 



 



 

“foreign exchange” used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales 

 

net sales by product category

the following tables present net sales by product category and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

 



 



 

 

 

 

the following table presents net sales by product category by geography for our knees and hips product categories which represent our most significant product categories dollars in millions 

 



 

 

demand volumemix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales had a positive effect of 49 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2019 volumemix growth was driven by recent product introductions particularly in our knees product category sales in key emerging markets and market growth market growth has generally been influenced by an aging global population obesity new technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors   

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 27 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2019 in the majority of countries in which we operate we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2019 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 16 percent on yearoveryear sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates we estimate they will have a minimal effect on sales in 2020 for the full year however we estimate sales will be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates in the first half of the year but that impact will be offset by positive effects in the second half of the year

sales by product category 

knees 

knee sales increased by 13 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 various product launches resulted in improved volumemix growth in the knee product category which was partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates knee sales growth was principally driven by increased demand for persona ® the personalized knee system the oxford ® partial knee and the rosa ® knee system

hips 

hip sales increased by 07 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 volumemix growth in this product category was partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates hip sales growth was primarily attributable to increased utilization of our taperloc ® complete hip system and g7 ® acetabular system 

set

set sales increased by 25 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to supply stability salesforce specialization and new product launches partially offset by price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

spine  cmf 

spine and cmf sales decreased by 22 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to ongoing sales channel consolidation in our spine division price declines and changes in foreign currency exchange rates demand for our thoracic products continued to positively contribute to sales

dental 

dental sales increased by 07 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 volumemix growth in our dental product category improved primarily due to investment of resources in priority areas as well as other operational improvements

the following table presents estimated 2019 global market information dollars in billions

 



 





expenses as a percent of net sales

 



 

 

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization 

we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2019 and 2018 compared to the prior year

 



 

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the effect of our hedging program lower royalty expense a refund related to us medical device excise taxes and lower intangible asset amortization we incurred hedge gains of 384 million in 2019 compared to hedge losses of 262 million in 2018 for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings the refund of a portion of the us medical device excise tax was the result of a change in the methodology we used to calculate the constructive sales price upon which the taxes were paid on july 1 2019 the irs approved and agreed to our change in methodology the reduction in royalty expense was partially the result of an agreement we entered into on april 1 2019 under the agreement we paid 1925 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from an unrelated third party this new agreement and the related payment replace the variable royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of previous licensing arrangements through 2029 the payment was recorded as an intangible asset and will be amortized through 2029 intangible asset amortization expense declined in 2019 due to certain intangible assets from past acquisitions being fully amortized partially offset by additional amortization from the agreement to buy out certain licensing arrangements we entered into on april 1 2019 these favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher manufacturing costs

 

operating expenses

rd expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased investment in our knee product pipeline costs associated with the eu mdr and patent licenses acquired for use in rd activities that were expensed immediately

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses and sga expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower litigationrelated charges in 2018 we recognized a 168 million litigation charge for a patent infringement lawsuit the lower litigationrelated charges were partially offset by higher selling costs due to higher sales investments in preparation for new product launches and higher expenses from legal entity distribution and manufacturing optimization including distributor contract terminations 

in 2019 we recognized a 701 million inprocess research and development “iprd” intangible asset impairment on certain iprd projects that we terminated in 2018 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 9759 million primarily related to our emea and spine reporting units

our quality remediation expenses continued to decline in 2019 due to the natural regression of completing our remediation milestones similarly acquisition integration and related expenses declined mainly due to the completion of certain integration efforts 

in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a new global restructuring program with an overall objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities we recognized expenses of 500 million in 2019 primarily related to severance associated with this program as well as expenses 

 

incurred related to a supply chain optimization initiative the 2018 cost reduction expenses only included expenses related to the supply chain optimization initiative 

other expense net interest expense net and income taxes

our other expense net primarily relates to certain components of pension expense investment gains and losses and remeasurement gains and losses related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency partially offset by the impact of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss the decline in other expense net in 2019 was driven by higher pensionrelated gains 

interest expense net declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to continued debt repayments and gains related to our crosscurrency interest rate swaps

 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings loss before income taxes was negative 249 percent a tax benefit was recognized on earnings before income taxes and negative 399 percent a tax provision was recognized on a loss before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively in 2019 we recognized an overall tax benefit in the year due to a 3150 million benefit from switzerland’s federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “traf” in addition to the tax impact of certain restructuring transactions in switzerland the traf is effective january 1 2020 and includes the abolishment of various favorable federal and cantonal tax regimes the traf provides transitional relief measures for companies that are losing the tax benefit of a ruling including a stepup for amortizable goodwill equal to the amount of future tax benefit they would have received under their existing ruling subject to certain limitations 

 

in 2018 our negative etr was primarily due to goodwill impairment that resulted in us having a net loss before income taxes with no associated tax benefit recognized for this charge in 2018 we also recognized an additional 83 million of income tax provision as we completed our estimate of the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “2017 tax act” 

 

absent discrete tax events we expect our future etr will be lower than the us corporate income tax rate of 210 percent due to our mix of earnings between us and foreign locations which have lower corporate income tax rates our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pretax earnings changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit

 



in the americas operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily due to improved sales volumemix and controlled spending in emea operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volumemix and gains recognized related to our hedging program in asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to volumemix net sales growth and gains recognized related to our hedging program 

nongaap operating performance measures

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were 16264 million 15654 million and 16364 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 787 764 and 803 respectively

liquidity and capital resources

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 15858 million in 2019 compared to 17474 million and 15823 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a payment of approximately 168 million on a patent infringement lawsuit additionally in 2018 we expanded our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries which provided additional cash inflows compared to 2019 when we sold fewer receivables at the end of the year which had a negative effect on operating cash flows 

cash flows used in investing activities were 7293 million in 2019 compared to 4166 million and 5108 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2019 we paid 1976 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from unrelated third parties instrument and property plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network including investments in instruments in 2019 to support new product launches 

cash flows used in financing activities were 7799 million in 2019 our primary use of available cash in 2019 was for debt repayment we received net proceeds of 5492 million from the issuance of additional eurodenominated senior notes which we used to repay 5000 million of senior notes that became due on november 30 2019 i n january 2019 we borrowed an additional 2000 million under a us term loan “us term loan c” and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repay the remaining 2250 million outstanding under the us term loan “us term loan b” provided for under our 2016 credit agreement during 2019 we also repaid the 7350 million outstanding balance under us term loan c with the remainder of the proceeds from the eurodenominated senior notes issuance and cash from operations overall we had approximately 710 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2019 in 2018 we received net proceeds of 7495 million from the issuance of additional senior notes and borrowed 4000 million from our 15 billion multicurrency revolving facility provided for under our 2016 credit agreement the “2016 multicurrency revolving facility” to repay 11500 million of senior notes that became due on april 2 2018 we subsequently repaid the 4000 million of 2016 multicurrency revolving facility borrowings in 2018 also in 2018 we borrowed 6750 million under us term loan c and used the cash proceeds along with cash generated from operations throughout the year to repay an aggregate of 8350 million on us term loan a 4500 million on us term loan b and we subsequently repaid 1400 million on us term loan c overall we had approximately 1150 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2018 

in february may august and december 2019 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date as of december 31 2019 all 10 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program

we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation we intend to use available cash for debt repayment reinvestment in the business and payment of dividends if the right opportunities arise we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in december 2019 our board of directors approved and we initiated a new global restructuring program with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities the restructuring program is expected to result in total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 350 million to 400 million with slightly more than half of that expected to be incurred in 2020 we expect to reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 200 million to 300 million by the end of 2023 as program benefits are realized

as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements the internal revenue service “irs” has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2012 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows

as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019 we have an estimated liability of 599 million related to durom cup product liability claims and a liability of 501 million related to biomet metalonmetal hip implant claims on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years 

 

at december 31 2019  our outstanding debt consisted of senior notes and term loans as follows dollars in millions 

 



we have a fiveyear unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of 15 billion the “2019 multicurrency revolving facility” that will mature on november 1 2024 there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2019 the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility replaced the 2016 multicurrency revolving facility effective november 1 2019 we also had other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 453 million as of december 31 2019 

we have 15 billion principal amount of notes due april 1 2020 we believe we can satisfy this debt obligation with cash generated from our operations by issuing new debt andor by borrowing on our 2019 multicurrency revolving facility we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary to satisfy this debt obligation

for additional information on our debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2019 3734 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 1021 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate in the future we intend to repatriate at least 50 billion of unremitted earnings of which the additional tax related to remitting earnings is deemed immaterial

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary

 

contractual obligations 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and certain other commitments in millions

 



 

1186 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2019 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2020 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

 

under the 2017 tax act we have a 2349 million toll charge liability for the onetime deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings this amount was recorded in noncurrent income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years

 

also included in longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 60 million

critical accounting estimates

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below

excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‑in‑process inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and riskadjusted discount rates  as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019 we estimated the fair value of our emea and dental reporting units only exceeded their carrying values by less than 5 percent fair value was determined using income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units significant assumptions are incorporated into the income approach such as estimated growth rates and riskadjusted discount rates fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our emea and dental reporting units as of december 31 2019 the remaining goodwill on the emea and dental reporting units were 7498 million and 3977 million respectively 

future impairment in the emea and dental reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline additionally changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates foreign currency exchange rates used to translate cash flows and comparable company valuation indicators which may impact our estimated fair values 

we have three other reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them the fair value of each of these three reporting units is sufficiently in excess of its carrying value which leads us to believe only a significant unforeseen event could cause impairment to any of these reporting units

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market risk

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes

foreign currency exchange risk

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2020 through june 2022 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2019 were 14963 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2019 were 2760 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2019 were eurousd 121 usdswiss franc 094 usdjapanese yen 10434 british poundusd 137 usdcanadian dollar 130 australian dollarusd 073 usdkorean won 1138 usdswedish krona 880 usdczech koruna 2211 usdthai baht 3117 usdtaiwan dollar 2960 usdsouth african rand 1540 usdrussian ruble 6881 usdindian ruppee 7426 usdpolish zloty 372 usddanish krone 615 and usdnorwegian krone 836

 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2022 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 



 

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 11935 million at december 31 2019 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements

 

commodity price risk 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

interest rate risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

the majority of our debt is fixedrate debt and therefore is not exposed to changes in interest rates based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2019 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense net this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and accounts receivable

we place our cash and cash equivalents and enter into derivative transactions with highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents or derivative instruments

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

customers sales and marketing 

our primary customers include orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we have operations throughout the world we manage our operations through three major geographic operating segments and four product category operating segments our three major geographic operating segments are the americas which is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets emea which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and african markets and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan china and australia and includes other asian and pacific markets our four product category operating segments which are individually not as significant as our geographic operating segments are as follows 1 spine less asia pacific “spine” 2 office based technologies 3 craniomaxillofacial and thoracic “cmf” and 4 dental 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors some healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment consignment sales represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2018 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2018

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical and dental procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units we are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons including the distribution channels through which products are sold our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product categories whereas our geographic operating segments have distribution channels that sell multiple product categories the following is a summary of our seven operating segments see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments

americas the americas geographic operating segment is our largest operating segment the us accounts for 94 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

in the americas we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital 

emea   the emea geographic operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for 56 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment 

asia pacific the asia pacific geographic operating segment includes key markets such as japan china australia new zealand korea taiwan india thailand singapore hong kong and malaysia japan is the largest market within this segment accounting for 46 percent of the region’s sales in japan and most countries in the asia pacific region we maintain a network of dealers who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region and sales associates who build and maintain relationships with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets the knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service product information and support to surgeons we have a research and development center in beijing china which focuses on products and technologies designed to meet the unique needs of asian patients and their healthcare providers 

spine the spine product category operating segment includes all spine product results except those in asia pacific the us accounts for the majority of sales in this operating segment the market dynamics of the spine business are similar to those described in the geographic operating segments however our spine business maintains a separate sales force of employees and independent sales agents

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public

most of our new products fall into an fda medical device classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are exempt or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufa cturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compli ance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the q sr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer m onitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or ap proval to market new and existing products the fda conducts announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the ma nufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form 483 that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter or a consent decree of permanent injunction the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and fda form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac”

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union the “eu” have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in may 2017 a new eu medical device regulation was published that will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the regulation has a threeyear implementation period and after that time all products marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements in addition many countries including canada and japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing with which we must comply

further we are subject to other federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the u s foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the united kingdom “uk” bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption r isks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj for information reg arding the dpa see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions health plans and health care clearinghouses a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information the us department of health and human services “hhs” through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 12 2018 the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the confidentiality security use and disclosure of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other personal information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws these state laws include the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which was signed into law on june 28 2018 and largely takes effect january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the ccpa which has substantial penalties for noncompliance and carries significant potential liability on our business

outside of the us data protection laws including the eu general data protection regulation and member state implementing legislation also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the eu general data protection regulation which became effective on may 25 2018 the “gdpr” imposes among other things data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations of up to 4 of total company revenue 

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

competition

the orthopedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for our knees hips and set products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation and smith  nephew plc there are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

in the spine and cmf categories we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic plc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag  part of the danaher corporation straumann holding ag and dentsply sirona inc

competition within the industry is primarily based on pricing technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials

we manufacture our products at various sites we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

the manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to in‑source and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

in most of our manufacturing network we have improved our manufacturing processes to harmonize and optimize our quality systems and to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers our warsaw north campus facility is in the process of implementing many of these manufacturing process improvements these process improvements are an integral part of our quality remediation plans

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements over 8500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we employed approximately 19000 employees worldwide including approximately 2000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 9000 employees are located within the us and approximately 10000 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 8500 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facilities employ approximately 3000 employees in the aggregate 

we have production employees represented by a labor union in each of dover ohio and bridgend south wales we have other employees in europe who are represented by works councils we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking 

statements the following list of significant risk factors is not alli nclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods you should carefully consider these risks and u ncertainties before investing in our securities 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017 we may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs

on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of the settlement we entered into a dpa with the doj a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report

if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa which conduct predated our acquisition of biomet as well as any new or continuing violations we could also be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions

our acquisitions involve numerous risks including















as a result if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the products we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other local state and foreign requirements compliance with these requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators which may result in observations such as on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk they could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter a consent decree of permanent injunction andor recommend prosecution any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility in may 2016 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our facility in montreal quebec canada in august 2018 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility as of february 20 2019 these warning letters remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of 

operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

govern mental regulations outside the us have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and complex in the eu for example a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which when it enters into full force in 2020 will include significant additional premarket and post market requirements complying with the requirements of this regulation will require us to incur significant expense additionally the availability of industry notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited which may cause delays in our receipt of ce certificate approvals and eu medical device regulation submission approvals any such delays or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws in addition we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices in addition certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa “covered entities” and their “business associates” covered entities are health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions health plans and health care clearinghouses a business associate is any person or entity other than members of a covered entity’s workforce that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information hhs through the office for civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations on december 12 2018 the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business

in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above a number of us states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the confidentiality security use and disclosure of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers medical and financial information and other personal information these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by us federal laws these state laws include the ccpa which was signed into law on june 28 2018 and largely takes effect january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the ccpa which has substantial penalties for noncompliance and carries significant potential liability on our business 

outside of the us data protection laws including the gdpr also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve the gdpr imposes among other things data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and possible substantial fines for any violations including possible fines for certain violations 

of up to 4 of total company revenue  other governmental authorities around the world are considering s imilar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection 

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include substantial civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions at december 31 2018 our total indebtedness was 89 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014  as of december 31 2018 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 7769 million as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things

















we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information our information systems and those of thirdparty vendors with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty vendors andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information cyberattacks such as those involving the deployment of malware are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could



















while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful despite our efforts we cannot assure you that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of













in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including







our competitors may











any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of















without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to

















in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors







moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2018 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including





























violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation

we may have additional tax liabilities

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law on december 22 2017 the “2017 tax act” with significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system although the us treasury has provided guidance on aspects of the 2017 tax act there still remains further guidance to be provided in the future on december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” expressing its views on the application of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes  in the reporting period that includes december 22 2017  for the financial statements that include the reporting period in which the 2017 tax act was enacted sab 118 provides a provisional approach to reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 tax act we finalized our provisional amounts for the effects of the 2017 tax act in our 2018 annual report on form 10k however our tax expense and cash flow could be impacted in the event of adverse future regulatory guidance provided by the us treasury clarifying certain aspects of the 2017 tax act

if the medical device excise tax is not repealed or further suspended our business results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

 

as part of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act or aca in january 2013 we began paying a 23 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our us sales a twoyear moratorium was placed on the tax effective january 1 2016 and that moratorium was extended for an additional two years effective january 1 2018 absent further legislative action the tax will be automatically reinstated for us medical device sales beginning january 1 2020 if the medical device excise tax is reinstated we will again be forced to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax we do not expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement under the affordable care act and other legislation nor do we expect to be able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from any further expansion of health insurance coverage through aca exchanges or medicaid expansion because of the demographics of the current uninsured population accordingly reinstatement of the medical device excise tax could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our f inancial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the ml taper and ml taper with kinectiv ® technology hip stems and versys ® femoral head implants and the m2amagnum tm hip system the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation “mdl” in the district of new jersey  in re zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation  the majority of the ml taper and ml taper with kinectiv technology hip stem cases and versys femoral head implant cases are pending in a federal mdl in the southern district of new york  in re zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis or ml taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology and versys femoral head products liability litigation   and the majority of the m2amagnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana  in re biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to pay for defense costs or to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any defense costs settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in 2015 we paid a compensatory damages award of approximately 90 million and in december 2018 we accrued an estimated loss of approximately 168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys’ fees in a patent infringement lawsuit 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedi es for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements we are defending a purported class action lawsuit shah v zimmer biomet holdings inc et al filed against us certain of our current and former officers certain current and former members of our board of directors and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging that we and other defendants violated federal securities laws by making materially false andor misleading statements andor omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016 although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results

our assets include intangible assets including goodwill at december 31 2018 we had 96 billion in goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 9759 million in 2018 if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges any writeoff of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations

developments relating to the uk’s referendum vote in favor of leaving the eu could adversely affect us

the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which voters approved the uk’s voluntary exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw which commenced a period of up to two ye ars for negotiating the uk’s withdrawal terms the uk and the eu have been negotiating the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu which is scheduled for march 29 2019 although the uk and the eu agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement in november 2018 the uk parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement in january 2019 creating significant uncertainty as to the terms under which the uk will leave the eu if the uk leaves the eu with no agreement it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade and will create further shortterm currency volatility brexit and the perceptions as to its impact have and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global fin ancial and foreign exchange markets brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu the future relationship for medical device products regulation and trade between the uk and the eu is currently uncertain and any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete also as a result of brexit other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu 

given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit is uncertain any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 









these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

executive level overview

2018 results 

in december 2017 we announced the appointment of a new chief executive officer “ceo” after evaluating the state of our business our ceo expects it will be a twoyear consisting of 2018 and 2019 effort to get the company operating at market level or above in terms of sales growth rates one of his first priorities was to improve our supply chain starting in 2016 and continuing into 2017 production delays at our warsaw north campus facility directly impacted our ability to fully meet demand in our knees hips and set product categories we successfully reduced backorders and increased safety stock levels in 2018 and no longer consider supply to be a barrier to delivering our financial commitments this resulted in improved sales growth in 2018 in our largest product categories of knees and hips knees and hips sales growth in 2018 was 15 percent and 26 percent respectively compared to a sales decline in knees of 06 percent and sales growth of 05 percent in hips in 2017 additionally this sales growth improved in the second half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2018 overall net sales increased by 17 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the improved product supply and completion of key research and development “rd” projects in our knees product category 

our net earnings loss decreased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 9797 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments and 1860 million of litigationrelated charges in 2018 compared to a 12724 million income tax benefit recognized in 2017 related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “2017 tax act” net earnings loss also decreased in 2018 due to increased excess and obsolescence charges and continued investments in rd and selling general and administrative “sga”

2019 outlook 

2019 will mark the second year of our twoyear turnaround effort in late 2018 and early 2019 we had various product launches in our knees product category which we anticipate will drive improving commercial momentum especially in the second half of 2019 we estimate the change in sales in 2019 compared to 2018 will be in a range of negative 05 percent to positive 05 percent this range includes estimated negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 percent to 15 percent we anticipate that most of the negative effects of foreign currency exchange rates will occur in the first half of the year 

assuming we have no significant goodwill and intangible asset impairments or litigation charges in 2019 we expect our net earnings to increase significantly compared to the net loss recognized in 2018 we expect our costs of products sold will continue to reflect costs associated with our quality remediation efforts we anticipate continuing to make investments in operating expenses to support our new product launches however we expect expenses related to our acquisition and integration activities and quality remediation will decline as we complete these projects during 2019 we believe that our interest expense net will continue to decline throughout the year due to lower anticipated debt levels 

results of operations

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set dental spine  cmf and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

 

net sales by geography 

the following tables present net sales by geography and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

the following table presents net sales by product category by geograph y for our knees and hips product categories which represent our most significant product categories dollars in millions 

 



 

 

demand volumemix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 32 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth during 2018 volumemix growth was driven by recent product introductions sales in key emerging markets and an aging population 2017 yearoveryear volumemix growth of 42 percent benefited from acquisitions made in 2016 that resulted in a full year of the sales of acquired companies reflected in the 2017 results

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 24 percentage points on yearoveryear sales during 2018 in the majority of countries in which we operate we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2018 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of 09 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates we estimate 2019 sales will be negatively affected by 10 percent to 15 percent

sales by product category 

knees 

knee sales increased in 2018 compared to a yearoveryear decline in 2017 knee sales have improved due to recent product launches and improved supply knee sales volumemix growth was led by persona the personalized knee system and the oxford partial knee

hips 

hip sales continued to experience yearoveryear sales growth driven primarily by volumemix growth which principally resulted from strong performance in our asia pacific and americas operating segments improved supply contributed positively to our results in the hips product category hip sales volumemix growth was led by our taperloc hip system arcos modular hip system and g7 acetabular system 

set 

our set sales continued to increase in 2018 driven primarily by strong performance in key surgical and upper extremity brands 

dental 

dental sales continued to decline in 2018 in the past few years our dental business has been affected by ongoing competitive challenges in the us and emea and restructuring of our dental organization in certain european markets

spine  cmf

spine and cmf sales continued to increase in 2018 primarily due to continuing strong sales of our thoracic products partially offset by a decline in spine sales driven by continuing us distributor integration issues yearoveryear sales growth in 2017 benefited significantly from the full year impact of an acquisition made in 2016

the following table presents estimated 2018 global market size and market share information dollars in billions

 



 





expenses as a percent of net sales

 



 

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization 

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior year

 



 

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher excess and obsolete inventory charges lower average selling prices and the effect of our hedging program we incurred hedge losses of 262 million in 2018 compared to hedge gains of 51 million in 2017 for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings 

 

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory stepup charges the reduction in inventory stepup charges resulted from the biomet inventory that was steppedup to fair value having been fully recognized by june 30 2016 in 2016 we recognized significant excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue but did not recognize significant charges in 2017 resulting in improvement to our gross margin percentage additional favorability was driven by lower medical device excise tax expense due to the two year moratorium on the us medical device excise tax and a favorable resolution on past excise taxes that were paid under the applicable accounting rules that we apply to the us medical device excise tax we had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and recognized expense through the fourth quarter of 2016 in january 2018 the moratorium on this tax was extended through december 31 2019 these favorable items were partially offset by lower hedge gains of 51 million in 2017 compared to 877 million in 2016 and the effect of lower average selling prices 

operating expenses

rd spending has remained generally consistent as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in new technologies to address unmet clinical needs in 2018 with tax savings resulting from the 2017 tax act we were able to invest in rd at a higher rate on projects such as our recent knee product launches

sga expenses and sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher litigationrelated charges increased expenses related to our compliance with the dpa increased incentive compensation due to better performance versus our operating budgets and various spending on other special business transformation initiatives our 2017 sga expenses and sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher litigationrelated charges increased freight costs due to expedited product shipments and increased investments in our specialized sales forces 

in 2018 we recognized goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our emea and spine reporting units in 2017 we recognized goodwill impairment charges related to our spine and office based technologies reporting units for more information regarding these charges see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition integration and related expenses declined in both 2017 and 2018 due to the natural regression of integration activities related to the 2015 biomet merger and other various acquisitions that were consummated in 2016 we are ne aring completion of our integration plans for these businesses 

our quality enhancement and remediation efforts began in late 2016 accelerated throughout 2017 and continued throughout 2018 these costs primarily relate to fees paid to temporary external consultants engaged to assist in the quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility we have completed many of our remediation milestones and expect quality remediation costs to continue to decline in 2019

other expense net interest expense net and income taxes

in 2018 other expense net was primarily related to certain components of pension expense and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency partially offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss in 2017 other expense net primarily related to certain components of pension expense and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency partially offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss in 2016 other expense net primarily included a 533 million loss on debt extinguishment it also included certain components of pension expense and losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss 

interest expense net declined in 2018 and 2017 when compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to continued debt repayments additionally we implemented hedging strategies that have lowered our interest expense net and we extinguished higherrate debt by issuing notes with lower interest rates

 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings before income taxes was negative 399 percent negative 2903 percent and positive 238 percent for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in 2018 our negative etr was primarily due to goodwill impairment that resulted in us having a net loss before income taxes with no associated tax benefit recognized for this charge in 2018 we also recognized an additional 83 million of income tax provision as we completed our estimate of the effects of the 2017 tax act in 2017 the negative etr was driven by the provisional income tax benefit we recorded of 12724 million from the 2017 tax act as well as 1113 million of tax benefit we recorded from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 tax act in 2016 we recognized 406 million of tax benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities which was partially offset by 276 million of additional tax provision related to finalizing the tax accounts related to the biomet merger 

 

absent additional discrete tax events we expect our future etr will be lower than the us corporate income tax rate of 210 percent due to our mix of earnings between us and foreign locations which have lower corporate income tax rates our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit

 



in the americas operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2018 primarily due to price declines and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2017 the americas segment was unfavorably impacted by price 

declines higher contribution of sales from products with lower gross profit margins and higher freight costs these unfavorable impacts were offset by lower us medical device excise tax expense 

in emea operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2018 due to price declines and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2017 operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to price declines and a reduced impact of hedge gains 

in asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2018 primarily due to price declines and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2017 operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to price declines and a reduced impact of hedge gains 

nongaap operating performance measures

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain inventory and manufacturingrelated charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines intangible asset amortization goodwill and intangible asset impairment acquisition integration and related expenses quality remediation expenses certain litigation gains and charges expenses to comply with the new european union medical device regulation other charges any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items the effect from finalizing the tax accounts for the biomet merger the effect of the 2017 tax act other certain tax adjustments and with respect to earnings per share information provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business additionally we believe these nongaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance we believe these measures offer the ability to make periodtoperiod comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations the nongaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the nongaap measures in addition adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 15654 million 16364 million and 16108 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 764 803 and 796 respectively 

 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts 

 



  

 



 







































 

liquidity and capital resources

cash flows provided by operating activities were 17474 million in 2018 compared to 15823 million and 16322 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in operating cash flows in 2018 compared to 2017 was d riven by additional cash flows from our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries lower acquisition and integration expenses and lower quality remediation expenses as well as certain significant payments made in the 2017 period in the 2017 perio d we made payments related to the us durom cup settlement program and we paid 305 million in settlement payments to resolve previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the decline in operating cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by additional investments in inventory additional expenses for quality remediation and the significant payments made in the 2 017 period as discussed in the previous sentence these unfavorable items were partially offset by 1740 million of incremental cash flows in 2017 from our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries 

cash flows used in investing activities were 4166 million in 2018 compared to 5108 million and 16915 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively instrument and property plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network in 2018 we entered into receivefixedrate payfixedrate crosscurrency interest rate swaps our investing cash flows reflect the net cash inflows from the fixedrate interest rate receiptspayments as well as the termination of certain of these swaps that were in a gain position in the year the 2016 period included cash outflows for the acquisition of ldr holding corporation “ldr” and other business acquisitions additionally the 2016 period reflects the maturity of availableforsale debt securities as these investments matured we used the cash to pay off debt and have not reinvested in any additional debt securities

cash flows used in financing activities were 13022 million in 2018 our primary use of available cash in 2018 was for debt repayment we received net proceeds of 7495 million from the issuance of additional senior notes and borrowed 4000 million from our multicurrency revolving facility to repay 11500 million of senior notes that became due on april 2 2018 we subsequently repaid the 4000 million of multicurrency revolving facility borrowings also in 2018 we borrowed another 6750 million under a new us term loan c and used the cash proceeds along with cash generated from operations throughout the year to repay an aggregate of 8350 million on us term loan a 4500 million on us term loan b and we subsequently repaid 1400 million on us term loan c overall we had approximately 1150 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2018 in 2017 our primary use of available cash was also for debt repayment compared to 2016 when we were not able to repay as much debt due to financing requirements to complete the ldr and other business acquisitions additionally in 2017 we had net cash inflows of 1035 million on factoring programs that had not been remitted to the third party in 2018 we had net cash outflows related to these factoring programs as we remitted the 1035 million and collected only 668 million which had not yet been remitted by the end of the year since our factoring programs started at the end of 2016 we did not have similar cash flows in that year

in january 2019 we borrowed an additional 2000 million under us term loan c and used those proceeds along with cash on hand to repay the remaining 2250 million outstanding under us term loan b 

in february may august and december 2018 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change as further discussed in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date as of december 31 2018 all 10 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program

we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business debt repayment and dividends if the right opportunities arise we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities 

as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the internal revenue service “irs” has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2012 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows

as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018 a shortterm liability of 195 million and a longterm l iability of 721 million related to durom cup product liability claims were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years we maintain insurance for product liability claims subject to self insurance retention requirements we have recovered insurance proceeds from certain of our insurance carriers for durom cuprelated claims while we may recover additional insurance proceeds in the future for durom cuprelated claims we do not have a r eceivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 for any possible future insurance recoveries for these claims we also had a liability of 704 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 related to biomet metalonmetal hip implant claims additionally we have a liability of approximately 168 million related to the stryker patent infringement lawsuit that we may be required to pay in 2019 

at december 31 2018 we had 12 tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows dollars in millions 

 



 

  euro denominated debt securities 

we also had four term loans with total principal of 10570 million outstanding as of december 31 2018

we have a fiveyear unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of 15 billion the “multicurrency revolving facility” that will mature on september 30 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31 2018 we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 550 million 

for additional information on our debt see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2018 3861 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 898 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate we intend to repatriate at least 51 billion of unremitted earnings in future years

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary

contractual obligations 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and certain other commitments in millions

 



 

671 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2018 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2019 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

 

under the 2017 tax act we have a 3024 million toll charge liability for the onetime deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings this amount was recorded in current and noncurrent income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years

 

also included in longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 58 million

critical accounting estimates

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below

excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‑in‑process inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the 

us an d numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb’s guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and riskadjusted discount rates  as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

prior to our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had six reporting units with goodwill assigned to them our annual impairment test determined our emea and spine reporting units’ carrying values were in excess of their estimated fair values fair value was determined using income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our emea and spine reporting units as a result of its carrying value being in excess of its estimated fair value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the emea reporting unit of 5670 million as of december 31 2018 7552 million of goodwill remains for this reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge for the spine reporting unit was 4012 million in 2018 no goodwill balance remains for this reporting unit

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment

since the carrying value of the emea reporting unit was written down to its estimated fair value future impairment could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline additionally changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates foreign currency exchange rates used to translate cash flows and comparable company valuation indicators which may impact our estimated fair values 

additionally in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 our dental reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 5 percent the goodwill balance of our dental reporting unit was 3872 million at december 31 2018 if our future operating results are below the estimations used for our impairment 

assessment or there are negative impacts from the broader economic environment then we may have to recognize goodwill impairment charges on this reporting unit in the future 

for our other three reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 25 percent we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income and market approaches if we do not achieve our forecasted operating results or if market valuation indicators decline we could be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in the future

qu antitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market risk

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes

foreign currency exchange risk

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2019 through june 2021 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2018 were 15477 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2018 were 2676 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2018 were eurousd 123 usdswiss franc 093 usdjapanese yen 10555 british poundusd 135 usdcanadian dollar 128 australian dollarusd 076 usdkorean won 1096 usdswedish krona 826 usdczech koruna 2161 usdthai baht 3321 usdtaiwan dollar 2936 usdsouth african rand 1382 usdrussian ruble 6453 usdindian ruppee 7164 usdturkish lira 511 usdpolish zloty 364 usddanish krone 609 and usdnorwegian krone 799

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest 

differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or dec rease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2021 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 



 

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 11385 million at december 31 2018 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

commodity price risk

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

interest rate risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

the majority of our debt is fixedrate debt and therefore is not exposed to changes in interest rates based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of decembe r 31 2018 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense net this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall e conomic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and accounts receivable

we place our cash and cash equivalents and enter into derivative transactions with highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents or derivative instruments

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

customers sales and marketing 

our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we have operations throughout the world we manage our operations through three major geographic operating segments and four product category operating segments our three major geographic operating segments are the americas which is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets emea which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and african markets and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan china and australia and includes other asian and pacific markets our four product category operating segments which are individually not as significant as our geographic operating segments are as follows 1 spine less asia pacific “spine” 2 office based technologies 3 craniomaxillofacial and thoracic “cmf” and 4 dental 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product direct channel accounts represented approximately 75 percent of our net sales in 2017 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2017

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consi stent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units we are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons including the distribution channels through which products are sold our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product categories whereas our geographic operating segments have distribution channels that sell multiple product categories the following is a summary of our seven operating segments see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments

americas the americas geographic operating segment is our largest operating segment the us accounts for 94 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

in the americas we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital 

emea   the emea geographic operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for 56 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment 

asia pacific the asia pacific geographic operating segment includes key markets such as japan china australia new zealand korea taiwan india thailand singapore hong kong and malaysia japan is the largest market within this segment accounting for 45 percent of the region’s sales in japan and most countries in the asia pacific region we maintain a network of dealers who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region and sales associates who build and maintain relationships with orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets the knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service product information and support to surgeons we have a research and development center in beijing china which focuses on products and technologies designed to meet the unique needs of asian patients and their healthcare providers 

spine the spine product category operating segment includes all spine product results except those in asia pacific the us accounts for the majority of sales in this operating segment the market dynamics of the spine business are similar to those described in the geographic operating segments however the spine business maintains a separate sales force of employees and independent sales agents

research and development

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques materials biologics and product designs the research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials biologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth

we are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places canada china france switzerland and other us locations as of december 31 2017 we employed approximately 1900 research and development employees worldwide

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public

most of our new products fall into an fda medical device classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 





all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are exempt or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the qsr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or approval to market new and existing products the fda conducts announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form 483 that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter or a consent decree of permanent injunction the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and fda form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac”

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union the “eu” have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in may 2017 a new eu medical device regulation was published that will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the regulation has a threeyear implementation period and after that time all products marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements in addition many countries including canada and japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing with which we must comply

further we are subject to other federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are 

punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans admi nistration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the united kingdom “uk” bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj for information regarding the dpa see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices

international data protection laws including the eu data protection directive and member state implementing legislation may also apply to some of our operations the eu data protection directive imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data moreover the general data protection regulation an euwide regulation that will be fully enforceable by may 25 2018 will introduce new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules 

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

competition

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for our knees hips and set products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation and smith  nephew plc there are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

in the spine and cmf categories we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic plc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation nuvasive inc and globus medical inc

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag  part of the danaher corporation straumann holding ag and dentsply sirona inc

competition within the industry is primarily based on pricing technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials

we manufacture our products at various sites we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

the manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to in ‑source and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

in most of our manufacturing network we have improved our manufacturing processes to harmonize and optimize our quality systems and to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers our warsaw north campus facility is in the process of implementing many of these manufacturing process improvements these process improvements are an integral part of our quality remediation plans

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements over 8000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products

employees 

as of december 31 2017 we employed approximately 18200 employees worldwide including approximately 1900 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 8500 employees are located within the us and approximately 9700 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 7900 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facilities employ approximately 2700 employees in the aggregate

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events such as the recent hurricanes that affected our employees and operations at our guaynabo puerto rico and ponce puerto rico manufacturing facilities or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the products we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other local state and foreign requirements compliance with these requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators which may result in observations such as on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk they could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter a consent decree of permanent injunction andor recommend prosecution any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility in may 2016 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our facility in montreal quebec canada as of december 31 2017 these warning letters remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results 

of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws in addition we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices

international data protection laws including the eu data protection directive and member state implementing legislation may also apply to some of our operations and restrict our ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data moreover the general data protection regulation an euwide regulation that will be fully enforceable by may 25 2018 will introduce new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions including the biomet merger we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information our information systems and those of thirdparty vendors with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty vendors andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information cyberattacks such as those involving the deployment of malware are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could



















while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful despite our efforts we cannot assure you that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of













in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including







our competitors may











any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing 

and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of















without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to

















in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors







moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost

effective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2017 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including





























violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation

we may have additional tax liabiliti es 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law on december 22 2017 the “2017 tax act” with significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the us treasury has provided limited guidance on aspects of the 2017 tax act and we anticipate further guidance will be provided in the future on december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” expressing its views on the application of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes  in the reporting period that includes december 22 2017  for the financial statements that include the reporting period in which the 2017 tax act was enacted sab 118 provides a provisional approach to reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 tax act the actual effects of the 2017 tax act and the final amounts recorded may differ materially from our current estimates of provisional amounts included in this annual report on form 10k further our tax expense and cash flow could be materially impacted as we finalize the financial accounting for the 2017 tax act and incorporate future regulatory guidance provided by the us treasury

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the nexgen knee system and the m2amagnum tm hip system the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation “mdl” in the district of new jersey  in re zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation  the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of illinois  in re zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation  and the majority of the m2amagnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana  in re biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to pay for defense costs or to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any defense costs settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litiga tion related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other propr ietary rights against others 

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending a purported class action lawsuit shah v zimmer biomet holdings inc et al filed against us certain of our current and former officers certain current and former members of our board of directors and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016 alleging that we and other defendants violated federal securities laws by making materially false andor misleading statements andor omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016 although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2017 we had 107 billion in goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity including the biomet and ldr mergers and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable as discussed further in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 3047 million in 2017 if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or 

future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges any writeoff of a material port ion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 while the particular material weakness has been remediated as of december 31 2017 additional material weaknesses or relapses of this material weakness could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act as discussed in part ii item 9a of this report we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 related to management’s controls over accounting for income taxes a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis during 2017 we executed our remediation plans to address the material weakness however if the remedial measures are not adhered to or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results 

developments relating to the uk’s referendum vote in favor of leaving the eu could adversely affect us

the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which voters approved the uk’s voluntary exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the effects of brexit are expected to be farreaching brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu however the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the uk may make to retain access to eu markets brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate also as a result of brexit other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by brexit is uncertain

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 









these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial foru m for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2016 and 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation 

on june 24 2015 we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date the biomet merger was a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business accordingly our sales and expenses have increased significantly since the merger date compared to prior periods 

executive level overview

2017 results 

net sales increased by 18 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of ldr holding corporation in the third quarter of 2016 and solid performance from our asia pacific operating segment in 2017 we experienced challenges across our knees hips and set product categories as a result of production delays from our warsaw north campus facility the production shortfall directly impacted our ability to fully meet case demand throughout 2017 we worked to improve our production levels at this facility but we continued to experience insufficient inventory levels across some brands within our knee hip and set product categories which impacted our ability to increase revenue 

our net earnings increased significantly in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a 12724 million income tax benefit we recorded related to the 2017 tax act additionally net earnings increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a decrease in inventory stepup expense lower biomet integrationrelated expenses lower performancebased compensation expense as a result of not achieving our 2017 operating plans and the recognition of 1113 million of tax benefit as a result of lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 tax act partially offsetting these favorable items were 3047 million of goodwill impairment charges on our spine and office based technologies reporting units and higher spending on quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility

2018 outlook 

in december 2017 we announced the appointment of a new chief executive officer “ceo” our new ceo has begun an indepth review of our business and formulating strategies to improve our performance his initial review likely will conclude during the first quarter and the implementation of those strategies will likely have an impact on our results in 2018 in the meantime we have identified several immediate opportunities to improve our operational execution and address certain nearterm challenges we will continue to work toward completing our quality remediation efforts at our warsaw north campus facility and continue to invest in bestinclass quality management systems we will remain focused on fully restoring the supply of certain key brands within our knee hip and set product categories we also have several key product launches planned in 2018 that we believe will be a catalyst for our future performance 

there are a few known items that are expected to impact our 2018 results increased manufacturing costs related to quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility in 2017 will be recognized in 2018 as we sell that inventory we expect ongoing benefits from the reduction of the us corporate tax rate but we plan to reinvest those savings into the business to drive sales growth additionally due to underperformance against our operating plans in 2017 we expect expenses from our performancebased compensation programs to increase if we are able to achieve our plans in 2018 we also expect our special items expense to decrease as we complete our biomet integration plans and substantially complete our quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility 

us tax reform 

 

2017 tax act the 2017 tax act includes a broad range of provisions many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous us tax law changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment as such our 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the immediate tax effect of the 2017 tax act 

 

the 2017 tax act contains several key provisions including among other things

 



 



 



 



 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an income tax benefit of 12724 million which was comprised of the following

 



the net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations made in applying the provisions of the 2017 tax act as of the time of filing this annual report on form 10k we further refined our estimates related to the impact of the 2017 tax act subsequent to the issuance of our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2017 in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the sec the income tax effect for certain aspects of the 2017 tax act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but with respect to which a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 the actual effects of the 2017 tax act and final amounts recorded may differ materially from our current estimate of provisional amounts due to among other things further interpretive guidance that may be issued by us tax authorities or regulatory bodies including the sec and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” we will continue to analyze the 2017 tax act and any additional guidance that may be issued so we can finalize the full effects of applying the new legislation on our financial statements in the measurement period which ends in the fourth quarter of 2018 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the 2017 tax act 

results of operations

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set dental spine  cmf and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

as previously disclosed sales increased significantly in 2016 when compared to prior years due to the inclusion of biomet sales for the entire year therefore we analyze 2015 sales on a pro forma basis because it represents how the zimmer and biomet underlying businesses may have performed on a combined basis pro forma sales assume the biomet merger occurred on january 1 2014 and therefore include the net sales of biomet in 2015 prior to the closing of the merger 

net sales by geography

demand volumemix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 43 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth during 2017 volumemix growth was driven by acquisitions in 2016 recent product introductions sales in key emerging markets and an aging population

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an a ging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products a nd patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 25 percentage points on yearoveryear sales during 2017 in the majority of countries in which we operate we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2017 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal effect on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with the end of 2017 this will have a favorable effect on sales in 2018 due to the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and other currencies

sales by product category 

knees 

knee sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 after growing in recent years due to the previously mentioned supply issues a price reduction mandate in india and continued pricing pressure knee sales volumemix growth was led by persona ® the personalized knee system and the oxford ® partial knee

hips 

hips sales continued to experience yearoveryear sales growth driven by volumemix growth primarily resulting from strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment volumemix growth was partially offset by the previously mentioned supply issues and continued pricing pressure hip sales volumemix growth was led by our taperloc ® hip system arcos ® modular hip system and g7 ® acetabular system 

set

our set sales have continued to increase driven primarily by a growing emphasis on sales force specialization strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions partially offset by the previously mentioned supply issues and continued pricing pressure 

dental 

dental sales continued to decline in 2017 the decline was driven by the restructuring of our dental organization in certain european markets

spine  cmf

spine and cmf sales continued to increase due to the full year impact of the ldr acquisition and continued strong performance of our thoracic products however sales were lower than expected due to sales force integration issues and additional complexities of merging the zimmer biomet and ldr supply chains

expenses as a percent of net sales

 



 

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2017 and 2016 compared to the prior year

 



 

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory stepup charges the reduction in inventory stepup charges resulted from the biomet inventory that was steppedup to fair value having been fully recognized by june 30 2016 in 2016 we recognized significant excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue but did not recognize significant charges in 2017 resulting in improvement to our gross margin percentage additional favorability was driven by lower medical device excise tax expense due to the two year moratorium on the us medical device excise tax and a favorable resolution on past excise taxes that were paid under the applicable accounting rules that we apply to the us medical device excise tax we had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and recognized expense through the fourth quarter of 2016 in january 2018 the moratorium on this tax 

was extended through december 31 2019 these favorable items were partially offset by lower hedge gains of 51 million in 2017 compared to 877 million in 2016 and the effect of lower average selling prices 

 

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization from the 2016 acquisitions excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue lower average selling prices and lower hedge gains from our foreign currency hedging program in 2016 compared to 2015 these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower inventory stepup charges from the biomet merger and lower expense from the us medical device excise tax in each case in 2016 compared to 2015 

operating expenses

after taking into consideration an increase in expenses related to the biomet merger and other 2016 acquisitions research and development “rd” spending has remained generally consistent as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in new technologies to address unmet clinical needs 

after taking into consideration an increase in expenses related to the biomet merger and other 2016 acquisitions selling general and administrative “sga” expenses as a percentage of sales have remained generally consistent in 2017 we recognized increased freight costs due to expedited product shipments and increased investments in our specialized sales forces these increases were partially offset by continued savings in various sga expense categories stemming from our synergies initiatives and lower performancebased compensation expense as a result of not achieving our 2017 operating plans 

in 2017 we recognized goodwill impairment charges related to our spine and office based technologies reporting units for more information regarding these charges see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

we recognize expenses resulting directly from our business combinations employee termination benefits certain rd agreements certain contract terminations consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring quality and operational excellence initiatives and other items as “special items” in our consolidated statements of earnings we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to biomet mergerrelated expenses such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stockbased awards retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and thirdparty sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date severance expense and contract terminations expenses declined in 2016 due to the absence of certain of these expenses in 2017 biometrelated integration expenses continued to decline but we have incurred additional costs related to quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges

other expense interest income interest expense and income taxes

in 2017 other expense net primarily included the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency partially offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss in 2016 other expense net primarily included a 533 million loss on debt extinguishment it also included losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss in 2015 other expense net included a 220 million loss on debt extinguishment debt issuance costs that we recognized for a bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets 

net interest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to our issuance of euro notes in the fourth quarter of 2016 and lower average outstanding debt balances due to debt repayments we used the proceeds of these euro notes which have a lower interest rate than most of our other debt to repay certain senior notes with higher interest rates in 2016 net interest expense increased compared to 2015 due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the ldr acquisition in july 2016 and the biomet merger in march 2015

 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings before income taxes was negative 2903 percent positive 238 percent and positive 46 percent for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we have incurred significant expenses associated with the biomet merger and other acquisitions which were generally recognized in higher income tax jurisdictions accordingly our etr was reduced as our earnings were lower in these higher 

income tax jurisdictions additionally other discrete adjustments have occurred that have significantly affected our etr the 2017 etr was driven by the p rovisional income tax benefit we recorded of 12724 million from the 2017 tax act as well as 1113 million of tax benefit we recorded from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 tax act in 2016 we recognized 406 million of tax benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities which was partially offset by 276 million of additional tax provision related to finalizing the tax accounts related to the biomet merger the 2015 tax rate resulted from ope rating losses in the us caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the biomet merger 

 

our future etr is expected to be favorably impacted by the 2017 tax act as a result of a reduction in the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent partially offset by a new us tax on certain offshore earnings referred to as gilti at an effective tax rate of 105 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 increasing to 13125 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 2025 with a partial offset from foreign tax credits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further details related to the 2017 tax act our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pretax earnings changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit

similar to our consolidated results our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments in the americas operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of sales in 2017 were similar to 2016 the americas segment was unfavorably impacted in 2017 compared to 2016 by price declines higher contribution of sales from products with lower gross profit margins and higher freight costs these unfavorable impacts were offset by lower us medical device excise tax expense and continued savings from our sga synergies initiatives in emea operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to price declines and a reduced impact of hedge gains in asia pacific operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to price declines and a reduced impact of hedge gains

nongaap operating performance measures

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain inventory and manufacturingrelated charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines quality enhancement and remediation efforts intangible asset amortization “special items” goodwill impairment financing and other expensesgains related to the biomet merger and other acquisitions debt extinguishment costs the interest expense incurred on the senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items the effect of the 2017 tax act and other certain tax adjustments other certain tax adjustments include internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to cash in a tax efficient manner resolution of certain matters with taxing authorities favorable tax rate changes adjustments to deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisitionrelated accounting the resolution of unrecognized tax positions established through goodwill as part of acquisition accounting and any tax item that would otherwise be distortive to the expected future tax rate we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believe they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance we believe these measures offer the ability to make periodtoperiod comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results to perform trend analysis to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items in addition certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 16364 million 16108 million and 13105 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 803 796 and 690 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts

  



 









  



 









 

liquidity and capital resources

cash flows provided by operating activities were 15823 million in 2017 compared to 16322 million and 8498 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively the decline in operating cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by additional investments in inventory additional expenses for quality remediation and 305 million in penalties paid to resolve previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these unfavorable items were partially offset by an estimated 174 million of incremental cash flows from our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries the increased operating cash flows in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily from the inclusion of biomet cash flows for the entire year operating cash flows also increased by an estimated 1031 million due to our sales of accounts receivable in certain countries in 2016 conversely in 2015 we had various significant cash outflows including a 976 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled and expenses related to completing the biomet merger 

cash flows used in investing activities were 5108 million in 2017 compared to 16915 million and 75579 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively instrument and property plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network the 2015 and 2016 periods included cash outflows for the biomet merger and ldr and other business acquisitions additionally the 2017 period reflects no investing activity related to availableforsale debt securities because as investments matured we used the cash to pay off debt

  cash flows used in financing activities were 12105 million in 2017  our primary use of available cash in 2017 was for debt repayment we borrowed amounts under a new japan term loan b and used the borrowings to pay down a portion of our us term loan a overall we had approximately 1250 million of net principal re payments on our senior notes and term loans in 2017 additionally in 2017 we had net cash inflows of 1035 million on factoring programs that had not been remitted since our factoring programs started at the end of 2016 we did not have similar cash f lows in prior periods 2015 and 2016 financing cash flows reflected borrowings necessary to complete the biomet merger and ldr acquisition 

in february may july and december 2017 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change as further discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date the previous program expired on february 29 2016 as of december 31 2017 all 10 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program

we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business debt repayment dividends and opportunistic share repurchases if the right opportunities arise we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities 

as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the internal revenue service “irs” has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2012 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows

as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 a shortterm liability of 780 million and longterm liability of 1214 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years we maintain insurance for product liability claims subject to selfinsurance retention requirements we have recovered insurance proceeds from certain of our insurance carriers for durom cuprelated claims while we may recover additional insurance proceeds in the future for durom cuprelated claims we do not have a receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 for any possible future insurance recoveries for these claims we also had a shortterm liability of 360 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 related to biomet metalonmetal hip implant claims 

at december 31 2017 we had eleven tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows dollars in millions 

 



  euro denominated debt securities 

we also had four term loans with total principal of 18011 million outstanding as of december 31 2017

we have a fiveyear unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of 15 billion the “multicurrency revolving facility” that will mature on september 30 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31 2017 we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 584 million 

for additional information on our debt see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2017 3822 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 819 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate we intend to repatriate at least 36 billion of unremitted earnings in future years

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary

contractual obligations

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions

 



 

671 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december   31  2017 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2017 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

under the 2017 tax act we recorded a 4660 million income tax expense related to the toll charge liability for the onetime deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings this amount is recorded in current and noncurrent income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017 we expect to elect to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years 

also included in longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion maintenance of exclusive 

rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these pay ments could range from 0 to 61 million 

critical accounting estimates

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below

excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‑in‑process inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb’s guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4897 million related to the durom cup see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation 

goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

we have six reporting units with goodw ill assigned to them in the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined our spine less asia pacific “spine” reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determ ined from other businesses that are similar to our spine reporting unit as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the spine reporting unit of 2720 million in 2017 as of december 31 2017 4215 million of goodwill remains for this re porting unit 

also in the third quarter of 2017 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 327 million on our office based technologies reporting unit using a market approach the 327 million impairment represented the entire goodwill balance of the reporting unit and therefore no goodwill remains

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment

for our other five reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 10 percent we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income and market approaches if we do not achieve our forecasted operating results or if market valuation indicators decline we could be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market risk

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes

foreign currency exchange risk

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2017 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2018 through june 2020 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2017 were 17359 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2017 were 2913 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2017 were eurousd 117 usdswiss 

franc 094 usdjapanese yen 10674 british poundusd 139 usdcanadian dollar 130 australian dollarusd 075 usdkorean won 1137 usdswedish krona 836 usdczech kor una 2301 usdthai baht 3482 usdtaiwan dollar 3086 usdsouth african rand 1426 usdrussian ruble 6305 usdindian ruppee 6912 usdturkish lira 396 usdpolish zloty 380 usddanish krone 642 and usdnorwegian krone 819 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2017 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2020 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions

 



 

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 28395 million at december 31 2017 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

commodity price risk 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

interest rate risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 

we have multiple variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as cash flow hedges of the variable interest rate obligations on our us term loan b the total notional amount is 3750 million the interest rate swaps minimize the exposure to changes in the libor interest rates while the variablerate debt is outstanding the weighted average fixed interest rate for all of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements is approximately 082 percent through september 30 2019 

the interest rate swap agreements are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting variablerate debt into fixedrate debt the objective of the instruments is to limit exposure to interest rate movements 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2017 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is li mited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our tr ade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business eco nomic and country specific variables our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems  most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints to the extent the respective governments’ ability t o fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

we previously identified and disclosed in our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis specifically we did not maintain the appropriate complement of resources in our tax department commensurate with the increased volume and complexity of accounting for income taxes subsequent to the biomet merger this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to our financial statements or disclosures but did result in outofperiod adjustments in our provision for income taxes and deferred tax liabilities that were individually and in aggregate immaterial additionally this control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of income tax related accounts and disclosures that would have resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform 

we allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units we are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons including the distribution channels through which products are sold our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product categories whereas our geographic operating segments have distribution channels that sell multiple product categories the following is a summary of our seven operating segments see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are exempt or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation 21 cfr part 820 “qsr” among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion our manufacturing operations and those of our thirdparty manufacturers are required to comply with the qsr which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the 

maintenance of records and documentation the qsr requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with fda regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices qsr compliance is necessary to receive and maintain fda clearance or approval to market new and existing products the fda makes announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the qsr if in connection with these inspections the fda believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures it may issue inspectional observations on form 483 that would necessitate prompt corrective action if fda inspectional observations are not addressed andor corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the fda’s satisfaction the fda may issue a warning letter which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter or a consent decree of permanent injunction the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain warning letters and fda form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department “ofac” 

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and 

 

  

   

certification to a quality system eg iso 13485 certification enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements in addition many countries including canada and japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing with which we must comply 

further we are subject to other federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services “oighhs” state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj for information regarding the dpa see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties contaminated by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

in addition we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively “hipaa” the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices 

international data protection laws including the european union “eu” data protection directive and member state implementing legislation may also apply to some of our operations the eu data protection directive imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data moreover the general data protection regulation an euwide regulation that will be fully enforceable by may 25 2018 will introduce new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules 

failure to comply with us and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions which could include civil andor criminal penalties private litigation andor adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for our knees hips and set products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation and smith  nephew plc there are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

in the spine and cmf categories we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic plc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag part of the danaher corporation straumann holding ag and dentsply international 

competition within the industry is primarily based on pricing technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at various sites we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

the manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to harmonize and optimize our quality systems and to protect our 

 

  

   

profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our 

competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements over 8000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 18500 employees worldwide including approximately 2000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 8700 employees are located within the us and approximately 9800 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 7800 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facilities employ approximately 2600 employees in the aggregate 

we have production employees represented by a labor union in each of dover ohio and bridgend south wales we have other employees in europe who are represented by works councils we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions 

our acquisitions involve numerous risks including 



       as a result if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet and ldr mergers and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet and ldr holding corporation “ldr” mergers at december 31 2016 our total indebtedness was 112 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014 we funded the cash portion of the biomet merger consideration the payoff of certain indebtedness of biomet and the payment of transactionrelated expenses through a combination of available cashonhand and proceeds from debt financings including proceeds from a 765 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2015 and borrowings of 30 billion under a fiveyear term loan in june 2015 in addition in september 2016 we borrowed 750 million under a threeyear unsecured term loan facility and utilized these funds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility incurred in connection with the acquisition of ldr also in december 2016 we issued €10 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the us dollardenominated senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger as of december 31 2016 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding capital leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 8911 million as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things 

  

 

  

   

     if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws in addition we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the oighhs the sec the ofac the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general 

we are also subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices 

international data protection laws including the eu data protection directive and member state implementing legislation may also apply to some of our operations and restrict our ability to collect analyze and transfer eu personal data moreover the general data protection regulation an euwide regulation that will be fully enforceable by may 25 2018 will introduce new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules 

the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017 we may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

on january 12 2017 we resolved previouslydisclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries 

as part of the settlement we entered into a dpa with the doj a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report 

if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa which conduct predated our acquisition of biomet as well as any new or continuing violations we could also be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations compliance with the fda’s requirements including the qsr recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations on one or more facilities enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter a recidivist warning letter or a consent decree of permanent injunction the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively manufacturing marketing and 

 

  

   

selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility in june 2015 biomet received a warning letter from the fda that requested additional information to allow the fda to evaluate the adequacy of biomet’s responses to certain form 483 observations issued following an inspection of biomet’s zhejiang china manufacturing facility in january 2015 in may 2016 we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed nonconformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our facility in montreal quebec canada as of december 31 2016 these warning letters remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including 

biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

     any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

       without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

 

  

   

     in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived nearly 40 percent of our net sales in 2016 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

              violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

 

  

   

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors’ manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on 

foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the nexgen knee system and the m2amagnum tm hip system the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation “mdl” in the district of new jersey  in re zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation  the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of illinois  in re zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation  and the majority of the m2amagnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana  in re biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would 

 

  

   

have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business for example as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending a purported class action lawsuit shah v zimmer biomet holdings inc et al filed against us and certain of our officers alleging violations of the securities laws related to our third quarter 2016 performance and 2016 forecasts although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data including from data breaches our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions including the biomet merger we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties and as a result we manage a number of thirdparty vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information our information systems and those of thirdparty vendors with whom we contract require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition given their size and complexity these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees thirdparty vendors andor business partners or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products systems or confidential information including but not limited to intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information cyberattacks such as those involving the deployment of malware are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could 

 

 

  

   

       while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful despite our efforts we cannot assure you that cyberattacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion breach interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we have determined that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting which could if not remediated result in a material misstatement in our financial statements 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15e and 13a15f under the exchange act as discussed in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 7a of this report we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 related to management’s controls over accounting for income taxes a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2016 we are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness however we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts if the remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2016 we had 105 billion in goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity including the 

biomet merger and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

recent developments relating to the united kingdom’s referendum vote in favor of leaving the european union could adversely affect us 

the united kingdom uk held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which voters approved the uk’s voluntary exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business the effects of brexit are expected to be farreaching brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu however the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the uk may make to retain access to eu markets brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate also as a result of brexit other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by brexit is uncertain 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

 

 

  

   

  these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation 

on june 24 2015 we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date the biomet merger was a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business accordingly our sales and expenses increased significantly in the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 when compared to prior years 

in portions of this discussion and analysis we also present sales information on an unaudited pro forma basis for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1 2014 accordingly the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014 

executive level overview 

 

2016 results 

in 2016 we made strategic internal and external investments to further broaden and diversify our musculoskeletal portfolio including the acquisitions of ldr which provided us with an immediate position in the growing cervical disc replacement market cayenne medical inc “cayenne medical” a sports medicine company compression therapy concepts inc “ctc” a provider of noninvasive products for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis cd diagnostics inc “cd diagnostics” a medical diagnostic testing company and medtech sa “medtech” a designer and manufacturer of robotic equipment for brain and spine surgeries these commercial additions have both enhanced our core offerings and expanded our presence across the full continuum and episode of care 

we have also continued to make progress in our commercial and operational integration of biomet across all geographies and functions despite this progress sales in 2016 were below our expectations due in part to some temporary disruption in product supply in certain knee hip upper extremities sports medicine and trauma product lines in the second half of 2016 related to several factors including implementation of operational and quality process enhancements that resulted in various shipment delays and 

manufacturing forecasting constraints related to continued integration of our supply chain in the second half of 2016 we saw increased demand for certain knee hip and upper extremities products particularly related to crossselling various offerings across the combined zimmer biomet portfolio the increased demand temporarily impacted our ability to effectively respond to this shifting product mix in response we accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing manufacturing and quality management systems we are in the process of deploying new demand planning and production planning tools we made progress on these enhancements in late 2016 and anticipate continued progress towards the replenishment of safety stocks on key crosssell products throughout the first half of 2017 

our 2016 results have been significantly impacted by the inclusion of biomet sales and expenses for the entire year including sales growth of 281 percent on an unaudited pro forma basis sales increased by 22 percent driven by volumemix growth across all our regions in most of our product categories including growth from our 2016 acquisitions offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued but stable pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions 

our net earnings increased in 2016 compared to 2015 the primary drivers of the improved earnings performance were the inclusion of biomet earnings for the entire year and the absence in 2016 of significant expenses incurred in 2015 in connection with completing the biomet merger as a result of the merger we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stockbased awards retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and thirdparty sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date severance expense a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed third party fees and other acquisition and integration charges while we did incur similar expenses in 2016 related to acquisitions they were less significant 

2017 outlook 

we estimate our sales growth in 2017 over 2016 will be in a range of 22 to 32 percent this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease sales by approximately 15 percent continued pricing pressure will decrease sales by approximately 2 percent and the inclusion of ldr sales for the full year will increase sales by approximately 12 percent as noted previously we expect to make substantial progress in remediating supply constraints during the first half of this year as we prioritize production for key crosssell brands clear our back orders and restore safety stocks 

additionally as part of our effort to implement certain regulatory compliance enhancements we are making operational and quality process improvements in certain of our major production facilities as such affected products may experience temporary and occasional distribution delays while 

 

  

   

we implement and validate these enhanced processes and generate the necessary supporting records we believe that continued progress towards restoring full supply expected during the second quarter will enable our commercial teams to service existing customers and also resume executing against the full potential of our broad and diverse portfolio as such we expect volumemix sales growth to improve as we progress through 2017 

turning to cost of products sold in 2016 we recognized significant expenses related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value and for excess and obsolete inventory charges from our decision to discontinue certain products without these significant expenses we expect cost of products sold will decrease in 2017 additionally due to the two year moratorium on the us medical device excise tax costs of products sold will decrease however we believe we will experience unfavorable effects on costs of products sold as a percentage of sales from declining selling prices as well as from lower hedge gains expected to be recognized in 2017 when compared to 2016 

as it relates to other expenses our intangible asset amortization expense is expected to increase as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the ldr merger and other 2016 acquisitions we expect research and development “rd” expense for the year to be 

approximately 45 percent of sales selling general and administrative “sga” expense is expected to approximate 375 percent of sales which is an improvement from 2016 as we expect to realize synergies from our acquisitions and leverage sales growth we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities as well as harmonize and optimize our supply chain and manufacturing and quality systems however we expect special items expense will be less in 2017 compared to 2016 we expect interest expense will decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower debt levels from planned debt repayments 

results of operations 

 

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product categories knees hips set dental spine  cmf and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies

as previously discussed sales increased significantly in 2016 when compared to prior years due to the inclusion of biomet sales for the entire year therefore we analyze sales on a pro forma basis because it represents how the zimmer and biomet underlying businesses may have performed sales discussion in this management discussion and analysis focuses on sales trends on a pro forma basis since that is how we analyze our business 

demand volumemix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 49 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth during 2016 on a pro forma basis volumemix growth was driven by recent product introductions sales in key emerging markets an aging population and 2016 acquisitions including ldr which contributed 11 percentage points of growth 

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products and patient 

specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 15 percentage points on yearoveryear sales during 2016 on a pro forma basis the negative 15 percent effect on yearoveryear sales was consistent with the range experienced over the past several years the majority of countries in which we operate continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2016 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 03 percentage points on yearoveryear sales on a pro forma basis we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which 

 

  

   

are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced 

sales by product category 

knees 

on a pro forma basis knee sales experienced steady volumemix growth in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by recent product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system crosssell opportunities and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment volumemix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure and the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets 

hips 

on a pro forma basis hips sales experienced steady volumemix growth in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by recent product introductions such as the g7 acetabular system and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment volumemix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure 

set 

on a pro forma basis our set sales have continued positive volumemix trends in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by a growing emphasis on sales force specialization strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions this product category’s subcategories all experienced growth in 2016 despite continued pricing pressure 

dental 

on a pro forma basis dental sales have continued to decline in the second half of 2015 we experienced a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue which we were not able to remediate until 2016 which affected our sales looking forward we must improve our commercial execution to get back to market growth rates 

spine  cmf 

on a pro forma basis spine and cmf sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the ldr merger and continued strong performance of our cmf products 

the following table presents estimated 2016 global market size and market share information dollars in billions

expenses as a percent of net sales 

 

 cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization 

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior year 

 

 the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization from the 2016 acquisitions excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue lower average selling prices and lower hedge gains in 2016 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2015 under the hedging program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower inventory stepup charges from the biomet merger and lower expense from the us medical device excise tax in each case in 2016 compared to 2015 

in 2015 we experienced a decrease in gross margin percentage compared to 2014 primarily due to increased inventory stepup charges and intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger 

 

  

   

operating expenses 

rd expenses and rd as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions the combination of our rd functions subsequent to the merger allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined rd spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create new market adjacencies additionally most of our rd activities occur in the us so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates which contributes to an increase in rd as a percentage of sales we expect rd spending in 2017 to stay consistent and be approximately 45 percent of sales 

sga expenses and sga as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions we expect that sga as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to these mergers and acquisitions until we can realize synergy benefits of the transactions and further leverage sales growth in 2017 we expect to make additional progress in our synergy programs with sga as a percentage of sales estimated to be approximately 375 percent of sales 

“certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries since 2008 we have recognized 4794 million for these claims for more information regarding these claims see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

we recognize expenses resulting directly from our business combinations employee termination benefits certain rd agreements certain contract terminations consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring quality and operational excellence initiatives and other items as “special items” in our consolidated statement of earnings we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to biomet mergerrelated expenses such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stockbased awards retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and thirdparty sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date severance expense and contract terminations expenses declined in 2016 due to the absence of certain of these expenses see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

other expense interest income interest expense and income taxes 

in 2016 other expense net primarily included a 533 million loss on debt extinguishment it also included losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss in 2015 other expense net included a 220 million loss on debt extinguishment debt issuance costs that we recognized for a bridge credit agreement 

that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets in 2014 other expense net only included debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities 

net interest expense has increased due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the ldr merger in july 2016 and biomet merger in march 2015 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 238 percent 46 percent and 234 percent respectively we have incurred significant expenses associated with the biomet merger and other acquisitions which were generally recognized in higher income tax jurisdictions accordingly this reduced our etr as our earnings were lower in these higher income tax jurisdictions additionally other discrete adjustments have occurred that have significantly affected our etr in 2016 we recognized 406 million of tax benefits from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities these benefits were partially offset by 276 million of additional tax provisions related to finalizing the tax accounts of the biomet merger the low 2015 tax rate resulted from operating losses in the us caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger our etr in future periods could potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pretax earnings changes in tax rates tax laws or their interpretation including the european union rules on state aid the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit 

similar to our consolidated results our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments in the americas operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to synergies from the biomet merger and a two year moratorium on the us medical device excise tax for the calendar years of 2016 and 2017 under the applicable accounting rules that we applied to the us medical device excise tax we still had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and continued to recognize expense albeit at a lower level than in 2015 related to the tax through the fourth quarter of 2016 in 2017 we intend to invest the savings from the medical device excise tax moratorium into our business in areas such as rd sales force specialization and medical training and education 

in emea operating profit as a percentage of sales declined due to the increased expenses related to the biomet merger lower average selling prices and a reduced impact of hedge gains in emea even though our integration plans are on schedule it will take longer to realize the full synergies of the merger compared to other segments due to the multiple 

 

  

   

countries in which we operate and the complexities in those countries 

in asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of sales declined due to the increased expenses related to the biomet merger lower average selling prices and a reduced impact of hedge gains 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain inventory and manufacturingrelated charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines quality enhancement and remediation efforts intangible asset amortization “special items” “certain claims” financing and other expensesgains related to the biomet merger and other acquisitions debt extinguishment the interest expense incurred on the senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments other certain tax adjustments primarily include internal restructuring transactions to integrate biomet operations and facilitate access to offshore earnings resolution of certain matters with taxing authorities adjustments to deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisitionrelated accounting the resolution of unrecognized tax positions established through goodwill as part of acquisition accounting that had not previously been recognized in the earnings of the acquired company and any tax item that would otherwise be distortive to the expected future tax rate we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believe they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance we believe these measures offer the ability to make periodtoperiod comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results to perform trend analysis to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items in addition certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 16108 million 13105 million and 10980 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 796 690 and 640 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts 

 

  

1 the tax effect for the us jurisdiction is calculated based on an effective rate considering federal and state taxes as well as permanent items for jurisdictions outside the us the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates where the items were incurred 

2 the 2016 period includes negative effects from finalizing the tax accounts for the biomet merger under the applicable us gaap rules these measurement period adjustments are recognized on a prospective basis in the period of change 

3 other certain tax adjustments primarily include internal restructuring transactions to integrate biomet operations and facilitate access to offshore earnings partially offset by resolution of certain matters with taxing authorities and adjustments to deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisitionrelated accounting

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities increased to 16322 million in 2016 compared to 8498 million and 10605 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively the increased operating cash flows in 2016 were primarily from the inclusion of biomet cash flows for the entire year we also sold 1031 million of our accounts receivable in certain countries in 2016 which improved operating cash flows conversely in 2015 we had various significant cash outflows including a 976 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled and expenses related to completing the biomet merger in 2017 we expect operating cash flows to be in a range of 17500 million to 19000 million 

cash flows used in investing activities were 16915 million in 2016 compared to 75579 million and 4694 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively instrument and property plant and equipment additions increased due to the biomet merger as we continue to invest in the combined company product portfolio and optimize our manufacturing and logistics network purchases and sales of investments in debt securities declined because as investments matured we used the cash to pay off debt and repurchase shares of our common stock in the 2016 period we also invested in the cayenne ctc ldr cd diagnostics and medtech acquisitions and other various assets in 2017 we expect to spend approximately 3300 million on instruments and 1700 million on property plant and equipment to support the ongoing business 

cash flows used in financing activities were 7432 million in 2016 this reflected approximately 10100 million of net principal repayments on the senior notes and term loan we issued in 2015 for the biomet merger we also borrowed 7500 million in 2016 for the ldr merger 

in february may july and december 2016 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 024 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change as further discussed below our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances 

in february 2016 our board of directors authorized a new 10 billion share repurchase program effective march 1 2016 with no expiration date the previous program expired on february 29 2016 as of december 31 2016 all 10 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program 

we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business debt repayment dividends and opportunistic share repurchases if the right opportunities arise we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities 

in order to achieve operational synergies we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately 3100 million in 2017 these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pretax operating profit synergies of 3500 million by mid2018 

as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements the internal revenue service “irs” has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows 

as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 a shortterm liability of 750 million and longterm liability of 2186 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers as of december 31 2016 we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover we have a longterm receivable of 953 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers we also had a shortterm liability of 574 million related to biomet metalonmetal hip implant claims 

at december 31 2016 we had twelve tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

 euro denominated debt securities 

we also had three term loans with total principal of 25496 million outstanding as of december 31 2016 

we have a fiveyear unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of 15 billion the “multicurrency revolving facility” 

 

  

   

that will mature on september 30 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31 2016 we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 471 million 

for additional information on our debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2016 4086 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 778 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

in light of our commitments under various credit facilities as well as our expectation for continued business development we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the us in particular as a result of the biomet merger we have unremitted foreign earnings of 36587 million which we plan to repatriate to the us in future periods we have estimated a longterm deferred tax liability of 11907 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 822 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2016 are liabilities related to 

defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we have also excluded longterm deferred tax liabilities from this table as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 57 million 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 

 

  

   

reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4794 million related to the durom cup see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate 

the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them in our 2016 impairment test our emea reporting unit’s estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent or approximately 240 million the goodwill balance of the emea reporting unit at the time of the impairment test was 13260 million this reporting unit’s estimated fair value continues to be lower than in past years due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar we estimated the fair value of this reporting unit by using a combination of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to the reporting unit in estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit we utilized a combination of market and companyspecific inputs that a market participant would use in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit the primary market input was revenue growth rates these rates were based on historical trends and estimated future growth drivers such as an aging population obesity and more active lifestyles significant companyspecific inputs included assumptions regarding how the reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact any new products will have on revenues discount rates used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows considered the weighted average cost of capital of other comparable companies and the country risk of our reporting unit under the guideline public company methodology we took into consideration differences between the reporting unit and the comparable companies 

the emea reporting unit remains sensitive to changes in market conditions if estimated cash flows for this reporting unit decrease we may be required to record impairment charges in the future the cash flows used in our annual impairment test are estimates and therefore involve uncertainty factors that could result in our actual cash flows being lower than our current estimates include 1 decreased revenues caused by unforeseen changes in these areas of the healthcare market our inability to generate new product revenue from our research and development activities or macroeconomic factors that may affect consumers’ ability to pay for these products and 2 our inability to achieve the estimated operating margins for these reporting units’ forecasts due to unforeseen factors additionally changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates or comparable company valuation indicators which may impact our estimated fair values 

for our other six reporting units their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 percent

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees turkish lira polish zloty danish krone and norwegian krone and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity 

dates ranging from january 2017 through june 2019 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2016 were 15126 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2016 were 3157 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2016 were eurousd 115 usdswiss franc 094 usdjapanese yen 10835 british poundusd 152 usdcanadian dollar 129 australian dollarusd 074 usdkorean won 1153 usdswedish krona 827 usdczech koruna 2365 usdthai baht 3605 usdtaiwan dollar 3214 usdsouth african rand 1556 usdrussian ruble 6992 usdindian ruppee 7177 usdturkish lira 320 usdpolish zloty 391 usddanish krone 656 and usdnorwegian krone 831 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2016 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2018 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 

 

  

   

any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 29358 million at december 31 2016 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 

we have multiple variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as cash flow hedges of the variable interest rate obligations on our term loan b the total notional amount is 3750 million the interest rate swaps minimize the exposure to changes in the libor interest rates while the variablerate debt is outstanding the weighted 

average fixed interest rate for all of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements is approximately 082 percent through september 30 2019 

the interest rate swap agreements are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting variablerate debt into fixedrate debt the objective of the instruments is to limit exposure to interest rate movements 

for details about these and other financial instruments including fair value methodologies see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2016 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints 

 

  

   

the ongoing financial uncertainties in the euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals as of december 31 2016 in greece italy portugal and spain countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our gross shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable combined were 1938 million with allowances for doubtful accounts of 166 million recorded in those countries the net balance was 1772 million representing 12 percent of our total consolidated shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable balance net italy and spain accounted for 1597 million of that net amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries we maintain contact with customers in these countries on a regular basis we continue to 

receive payments albeit at a slower rate than in the past we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 

 

  

   

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of zimmer biomet holdings inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

based on their assessment management concluded that the company did not maintain effective controls over its accounting for income taxes specifically the company did not maintain the appropriate complement of resources in its tax department commensurate with the increased volume and complexity of accounting for income taxes subsequent to the biomet merger this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to the company’s financial statements or disclosures but did result in outofperiod adjustments in the company’s provision for income taxes and deferred tax liabilities that were individually and in aggregate immaterial additionally this control deficiency could result in misstatements of income tax related accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly the company’s management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 

because of this material weakness management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 as stated in its report which appears in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 13a15f under the exchange act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures because of inherent limitations disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2016 the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in item 7a 

in light of this material weakness the company performed additional analysis and other postclosing procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted 

accounting principles accordingly management concluded that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 

remediation plan  management has begun implementing a remediation plan to address the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness the remediation plan includes adding additional resources and strengthening our income tax controls with improved technical oversight and training we believe these additional resources will enhance our review procedures and will effectively remediate the material weakness but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable measures have been implemented for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that the enhanced control is operating effectively as we continue to evaluate and improve our internal control over financial reporting we may decide to take additional measures to address this material weakness which may require additional implementation time further we cannot provide any assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts 

changes in internal control over financial reporting  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

zimmer biomet holdings was incorporated in delaware in 2001 our history dates to 1927 when zimmer manufacturing company a predecessor was founded in warsaw indiana on august 6 2001 we were spun off from our former parent and became an independent public company 

on june 24 2015 the “closing date” we acquired lvb acquisition inc “lvb” the parent company of biomet inc “biomet” and lvb and biomet became our whollyowned subsidiaries sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “biomet merger” or the “merger” in connection with the merger we changed our name from zimmer holdings inc to zimmer biomet holdings inc the biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business throughout 2015 and entering 2016 a key focus of ours has been and will continue to be the successful integration of biomet

customers sales and marketing 

 

our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons and other specialists dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we have operations throughout the world we manage our operations through three major geographic operating segments and four product category operating segments our three major geographic operating segments are the americas which is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets emea which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and african markets and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan and includes other asian and pacific 

markets our four product category operating segments which are individually not as significant as our geographic operating segments are as follows 1 americas spine 2 bone healing 3 craniomaxillofacial and thoracic “cmf” and 4 dental 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2015 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2015 

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons other specialists dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform 

due to the biomet merger we changed our senior management organizational structure which has resulted in a change to our operating segments we now allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units we are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons including the distribution channels through which products are sold our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product 

 

  

   

categories whereas our geographic operating segments have distribution channels that sell multiple product categories the following is a summary of our seven operating segments see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments 

americas the americas geographic operating segment is our largest operating segment the us accounts for 94 percent of net sales in this region the us sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer biomet the sales force in the us receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

in the americas we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital 

emea the emea geographic operating segment is our second largest operating segment france germany italy spain and the united kingdom collectively account for 62 percent of net sales in the region this segment also includes other key markets including switzerland benelux nordic central and eastern europe the middle east and africa our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates commissioned agents independent distributors and sales support personnel we emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces in most european countries healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending which can affect our sales in this segment

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration “fda” has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval “pma” requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which are exempt or were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of 

adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulations among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion the quality system regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund payment of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices 

the fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice “doj” 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection “cbp” administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department 

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

further we are subject to various federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these 

 

  

   

laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration “va” health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for our knees hips and set products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation and smith  nephew plc there are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

in the spine and cmf categories we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag part of the danaher corporation straumann holding ag and dentsply international 

competition within the industry is primarily based on pricing technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at various sites we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

the manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy 

focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements approximately 7000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 17500 employees worldwide including approximately 1700 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 8400 employees are located within the us and approximately 9100 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 7700 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facilities employ approximately 2800 employees in the aggregate 

 

  

   

we have production employees represented by a labor union in dover ohio and bridgend south wales we have other 

employees in europe who are represented by works councils we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

successful integration of biomet and anticipated benefits of the biomet merger are not assured and integration matters could divert attention of management away from operations also the merger could have an adverse effect on our business relationships 

although biomet has become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours it is initially continuing its operations on a basis that is separate from the legacy zimmer operations there can be no assurance that biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations in addition the market segments in which biomet operates may experience declines in demand andor new competitors customers suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us andor biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate change andor renegotiate their relationships with us andor biomet as a result of the merger whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us andor biomet or otherwise 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the biomet merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the legacy businesses integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of biomet with ours involves complex operational technological and personnelrelated challenges this process is timeconsuming and expensive disrupts the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions the potential difficulties and resulting costs and delays include 

       

additionally the integration of our and biomet’s operations products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources the attention of our management may be directed towards integration considerations and may be diverted from our daytoday business operations and matters related to the integration may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us the diversion of management’s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

even if our businesses are successfully integrated we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including anticipated synergies cost savings or growth opportunities within the expected timeframe or at all in addition we expect to incur significant integration and restructuring expenses to realize synergies however many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all 

any of these matters could adversely affect our businesses or harm our financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet merger at december 31 2015 our total indebtedness was 116 billion as compared to 14 billion at december 31 2014 we funded the cash portion of the merger consideration the payoff of certain indebtedness of biomet and the payment of transactionrelated expenses through a combination of available cashonhand and proceeds from debt financings including proceeds from a 765 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2015 and borrowings of 30 billion under our 435 billion credit agreement as of december 31 2015 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding capital leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months are expected to be 3398 million as a result of the increase in our debt demands on our cash resources have increased the increased level of debt could among other things 



 

  

   

       if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws in addition we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anticorruption and antibribery matters sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration health programs these laws are administered by among others the doj the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services “oighhs” the sec the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury “ofac” the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce and state attorneys general the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change 

biomet is involved in ongoing governmental investigations the results of which may adversely impact our business and results of operations further if biomet fails to comply with the terms of the dpa that it entered into in march 2012 it may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

on march 26 2012 biomet entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” with the doj and a consent to final judgment “consent” with the sec related to an investigation by the doj and the sec into possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” in the marketing and sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries pursuant to the dpa the doj agreed to defer prosecution of biomet in connection with those matters 

provided that biomet satisfies its obligations under the dpa over the term of the dpa the dpa had a threeyear term and provided that it could be extended in the sole discretion of the doj for an additional year 

pursuant to the consent biomet consented to the entry of a final judgment which among other things permanently enjoined biomet from violating the provisions of the fcpa in addition pursuant to the terms of the dpa an independent external compliance monitor was appointed to review biomet’s compliance with the dpa particularly in relation to biomet’s international sales practices the consent that biomet entered into with the sec mirrors the dpa’s provisions with respect to the compliance monitor 

in october 2013 biomet became aware of certain alleged improprieties regarding its operations in brazil and mexico including alleged improprieties that predated the entry of the dpa biomet retained counsel and other experts to investigate both matters based on the results of the ongoing investigations biomet has terminated suspended or otherwise disciplined certain of the employees and executives involved in these matters and has taken certain other remedial measures additionally pursuant to the terms of the dpa in april 2014 and thereafter biomet disclosed these matters to and discussed these matters with the independent compliance monitor and the doj and sec on july 2 2014 and july 13 2015 the sec issued subpoenas to biomet requiring that biomet produce certain documents relating to such matters these matters remain under investigation by the doj 

on march 13 2015 the doj informed biomet that the dpa and the independent compliance monitor’s appointment have been extended for an additional year on april 2 2015 at the request of the staff of the sec biomet consented to an amendment to the final judgment to extend the term of the compliance monitor’s appointment for one year from the date of entry of the amended final judgment 

pursuant to the dpa the doj has sole discretion to determine whether conduct by biomet constitutes a violation or breach of the dpa the doj has informed biomet that it retains its rights under the dpa to bring further action against biomet relating to the conduct in brazil and mexico referenced above or the violations set forth in the dpa the doj could among other things revoke the dpa or prosecute biomet andor the involved employees and executives biomet continues to cooperate with the sec and doj and expects that discussions with the sec and the doj will continue 

in june 2013 biomet received a subpoena from the us attorney’s office for the district of new jersey requesting various documents relating to the fitting of customfabricated or customfitted orthoses or bracing to patients in new jersey texas and washington biomet has produced responsive documents and is fully cooperating with the request of the us attorney’s office we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome 

in july 2011 biomet received an administrative subpoena from ofac requesting documents concerning the export of products to iran ofac informed biomet that the subpoena related to allegations that biomet may have been involved in 

 

  

   

unauthorized sales of dental products to iran biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation and submitted its response to the subpoena in october 2011 we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome 

in february 2010 biomet received a subpoena from the oighhs requesting various documents relating to agreements or arrangements between physicians and biomet’s interpore cross subsidiary for the period from 1999 through the date of the subpoena and the marketing and sales activities associated with interpore cross’ spinal products biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome 

as a result of the merger all obligations and liabilities of biomet related to the above matters have been assumed by us as the combined company from time to time we are and may continue to be the subject of additional investigations if as a result of the investigations described above or any additional investigations we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful we may have to modify those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations compliance with the fda’s requirements including the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates to foreign 

governments for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility in june 2015 biomet received a warning letter from the fda that requested additional information to allow the fda to evaluate the adequacy of biomet’s responses to certain form 483 observations issued following an inspection of biomet’s zhejiang china manufacturing facility in january 2015 as of december 31 2015 these warning letters remained pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasterrelated events or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality system regulation and good manufacturing practice requirements equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

   

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

     any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments further the legacy independent agents and distributors of us or biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate change andor renegotiate their relationships with us andor biomet as a result of the merger a loss of a significant number of the combined company’s agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

    

  without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

        in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased 

 

  

   

pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived over 40 percent of our net sales in 2015 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

         

    violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors’ manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

moreover we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries we filed reports on form sd with the sec regarding such matters in june 2014 and 2015 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions 

 

  

   

and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component “durom cup” certain products within the nexgen knee system and the m2amagnum ™ hip system the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation “mdl” in the district of new jersey  in re zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation  the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of illinois  in re zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation  and the majority of the m2amagnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of 

indiana  in re biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that 

 

  

   

may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions including the biomet merger we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could 



        while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2015 we had 99 billion in goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity including the biomet merger and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

certain investors continue to have influence over us including in connection with decisions that require the approval of stockholders which could limit other stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

in connection with our acquisition of biomet we entered into a stockholders agreement the “stockholders agreement” with lvb acquisition holding llc and its owners party thereto collectively the “sponsors” the sponsors and certain of their affiliates currently hold approximately 94 of our common stock in addition representatives of the sponsors currently have the right to designate two members of our board of directors as a result the sponsors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the terms thereof 

additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us one 

 

  

   

or more of these entities may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

future sales or the perception of future sales by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

pursuant to the stockholders’ agreement we have filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering shares of our common stock for resale by the sponsors two of the sponsors recently completed the sale of approximately 110 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering the sponsors own approximately 186 million additional shares that may be offered and sold under the resale registration statement the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by us or our existing stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation our restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

    these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

our restated bylaws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees alternatively if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in 2015 while the particular material weakness has been remediated as of december 31 2015 additional material weaknesses or relapses of this material weakness could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act as discussed in part ii item 9a of this report we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended september 30 2015 related to the control over accounting for nonroutine complex transactions a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis during the fourth quarter of 2015 we executed our remediation plans to address the material weakness however if the remedial measures are not adhered to or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation additionally as more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report due to accounting errors in prior periods certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been revised 

on june 24 2015 we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date the biomet merger is a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business accordingly our revenues and expenses increased significantly in the year ended december 31 2015 

in portions of this discussion and analysis we also present sales information on an unaudited pro forma basis for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1 2014 accordingly the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014 such pro forma net sales information may not be indicative however of future operating performance 

executive level overview 

 

2015 results 

the last half of 2015 was significantly affected by our biomet integration activities we made significant progress by accomplishing important commercial integration milestones across all geographies we largely completed the appointment of our global sales leaders we also began to execute our integration roadmaps designed to capture the net operating synergy opportunities presented by this merger 

our results have been significantly impacted by the biomet merger our sales for 2015 increased by 283 percent primarily due to the biomet merger volumemix growth from the merger was partially offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued but stable pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions 

our net earnings decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 the primary driver of the lower net earnings was expense incurred in connection with the biomet merger as a result of the merger we recognized significant expenses due to stepping up the acquired inventory to fair value intangible asset amortization the acceleration of the vesting of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stockbased awards retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and thirdparty sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date severance expense contract termination expense related to agreements with independent agents distributors suppliers and lessors a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed third party fees and other acquisition and integration charges interest expense also increased due to financingrelated costs for the merger 

2016 outlook 

we expect our sales in the first half of 2016 to be higher than in the first half of 2015 on a reported basis since the biomet merger was completed midway through 2015 on a pro forma basis we expect revenues to be approximately flat in 2016 compared to 2015 this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent continued pricing pressure will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent and our volumemix growth will be approximately 4 percent we expect pro forma sales growth will improve in the last half of the year compared to the first half as our sales force stabilizes we take advantage of crossselling opportunities and we anniversary out of many sales force dissynergies caused by the merger 

we expect cost of products sold to continue to realize significant expense related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value similarly our intangible asset amortization expense will increase significantly as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger we expect research and development “rd” expense for the year to be in a range of 45 to 50 percent of sales selling general and administrative “sga” expense is expected to approximate 37 percent of sales which is an improvement from 2015 as we realize synergies from the merger we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities however we expect special items expense will be less in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the significant initial expenses incurred in 2015 for the integration interest expense will increase in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the debt borrowed in 2015 to fund the biomet merger 

results of operations 

 

we analyze sales by three geographies the americas emea and asia pacific and by the following product 

 

  

   

categories knees hips set dental spine  cmf and other this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals we analyze sales by 

geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies 

 

 

net sales by geography 

the following tables present net sales by geography and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions

 the following table presents our pro forma net sales by product category by geography for our knees and hips product categories which represent our most significant product categories dollars in millions 

 

  

demand volume and mix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 367 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth during 2015 volumemix growth was driven by the biomet merger new product introductions and sales in key emerging markets 

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 20 percentage points on yearoveryear sales during 2015 the negative 20 percent effect on yearoveryear sales is consistent with what we have experienced over the past three years the majority of countries in which we operate continued to 

experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 

foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2015 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 64 percentage points on yearoveryear sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced 

sales by product category 

knees 

knee sales increased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger on a pro forma basis knee sales declined in 2015 due to changes in foreign currency exchange 

 

  

   

rates the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets and continued pricing pressure the volumemix growth on a pro forma basis was driven by recent product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system in particular our emea and asia pacific operating segments experienced strong volumemix growth in this product category 

hips 

hip sales increased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger on a pro forma basis positive volume and mix trends were more than offset by pricing pressure and the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

set 

our set product category sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger on a pro forma basis positive volume and mix trends were more than offset by pricing pressure the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets and the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a pro forma basis within this category our extremities business achieved solid sales growth from sales of our shoulder and elbow products 

dental 

dental sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger on a pro forma basis sales in 2015 declined partly due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue and the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are in the process of remediating the supply disruption and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter of 2016 

spine  cmf 

spine and cmf sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger on a pro forma basis strong sales of our cmf products were offset by a decline in spine product sales

expenses as a percent of net sales 

 

 cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization 

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2015 and 2014 compared to the prior year 

 

 the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased inventory stepup costs as well as increased intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger the decline was also a result of lower average selling prices and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher hedge gains in 2015 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2014 under the hedging program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings further we experienced improved product category and geographic mix resulting in lower average costs per unit sold as a percentage of sales 

in 2014 we experienced an increase in gross margin percentage compared to 2013 primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges related to products we 

 

  

   

intend to discontinue we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013 

operating expenses 

rd expenses and rd as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 the primary driver of the increased expense was the biomet merger the combination of our rd functions subsequent to the merger will allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined rd spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create newmarket adjacencies additionally most of our rd activities occur in the us so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates which contributes to an increase in rd as a percentage of sales the increase in 2015 reverses a trend of declines in rd expense and rd as a percentage of sales in prior years the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization including persona the personalized knee system and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives we expect rd spending in 2016 to increase and be between 45 and 50 percent of sales 

sga as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 after realizing improvements in 2014 and 2013 due to our operational excellence initiatives the biomet merger was the primary cause of the increase we expect that sga as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to the biomet merger until we can realize synergy benefits of the merger additionally a significant portion of our sga expenses occur in the us so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

“certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries we recorded additional expense of 77 million in 2015 for durom cuprelated claims since 2008 we have recognized 4794 million for these claims for more information regarding these claims see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

“special items” have increased significantly in the past three years the increases in 2015 were due to biomet mergerrelated expenses such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stockbased awards retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and thirdparty sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date severance expense and contract terminations “special items” expense also includes our quality and operational excellence initiatives which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and our information technology systems see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

other expense interest income interest expense and income taxes 

other expense net represents debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement that we entered 

into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity’s functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss and the call premium expense we recognized when we repaid biomet’s senior notes partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets the decrease in other expense net in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by fewer months of debt issuance costs from the bridge credit agreement and the gains recognized on the sale of the product line rights and assets 

net interest expense increased in 2015 due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the biomet merger 

our effective tax rate “etr” on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 46 percent 234 percent and 228 percent respectively “special items” expense has significantly affected our etr as such expenses have generally been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions the low 2015 tax rate results from operating losses in the us caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger the us has a higher tax rate compared to the majority of foreign operations where we realized operating income we expect “special items” the outcome of various federal state and foreign audits as well as expiration of certain statutes of limitations to impact our etr in future years currently we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results 

segment operating profit 

similar to our consolidated results our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments in the americas operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 as we started to realize synergies of the merger in emea operating profit as a percentage of sales declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the increased biomet expenses this decline is expected to continue until we can realize the synergy benefits of the merger in this region in the asia pacific segment operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our hedging program 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain other inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts “certain claims” intangible asset amortization “special items” other expenses related to financing obtained for the biomet merger other expenses related to the call premium expense recognized to redeem the assumed biomet senior notes the interest expense incurred on issued debt during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger and any related effects on 

 

  

   

our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it provides useful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and it provides additional transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 13105 million 10980 million and 10690 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 690 640 and 622 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts 

 

  

 the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates for the jurisdictions where the items were incurred 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities declined to 8167 million in 2015 compared to 10528 million in 2014 the decreased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 were primarily due to higher expenses related to the biomet merger a 976 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled in march 2015 when we issued senior notes for the biomet merger and inventory investments these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower tax payments and the receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims in the 2015 period in 2014 we made significant tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges in 2016 we estimate operating cash flows to be in a range of 16500 million to 17500 million inclusive of approximately 2900 million of outflows related to integration expenses to drive synergies 

cash flows used in investing activities were 75579 million in 2015 compared to 4694 million in 2014 the primary investing activity in 2015 was the biomet merger we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches such as persona the personalized knee system as we deploy that system around the world in 2016 we expect instrument investments to be in a range of 3000 million to 3250 million in support of our crosssell initiatives as well as new product introductions in 2015 we continued to invest in other property plant and equipment at levels necessary to complete new productrelated investments and to replace older machinery and equipment in 2016 we expect to spend approximately 2500 million on property plant and equipment including 1050 million necessary to rationalize facilities and it systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing and logistics network 

cash flows provided by financing activities were 71398 million in 2015 compared to a use of cash of 5624 million in 2014 we issued debt in 2015 for the biomet merger which resulted in proceeds and related debt issuance costs we also repaid biomet’s senior notes that we assumed in the merger additionally with an increase in our stock price throughout 2014 many employees exercised stock options in the prior year accordingly there were fewer stock options outstanding at the end of 2014 leading to fewer option exercises in 2015 compared to 2014 

in february may july and december 2015 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 022 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change as further discussed below our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances 

as of december 31 2015 4495 million remained authorized under our 10 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date in anticipation of the merger with biomet we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014 we commenced share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued repurchases in the first two months of 2016 

 

  

   

through february 25 2016 we repurchased approximately 4150 million of shares of our common stock which includes the 2500 million of shares that we repurchased from certain selling stockholders on february 10 2016 

in order to achieve operational synergies we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately 2900 million in 2016 these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pretax operating profit synergies of 3500 million by the end of the third year postclosing date 

also as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015 a shortterm liability of 500 million and longterm liability of 2646 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers as of december 31 2015 we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover we have a longterm receivable of 953 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers we also had a shortterm liability of 334 million related to biomet metalonmetal hip implant claims 

at december 31 2015 we had ten tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows dollars in millions 

 

 we issued 765 billion of senior notes in march 2015 the “merger notes” the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in the biomet merger pay merger related fees and expenses and pay a portion of biomet’s funded debt on june 24 2015 we also borrowed 30 billion on a us term loan “us term loan” to fund the biomet merger 

we may at our option redeem our senior notes in whole or in part at any time upon payment of the principal any applicable makewhole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption in addition the merger notes and the 3375 senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any makewhole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date 

we have a 435 billion credit agreement “credit agreement” that contains i a 5year unsecured us term loan facility “us term loan facility” in the principal amount 

of 30 billion and ii a 5year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility “multicurrency revolving facility” in the principal amount of 135 billion the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019 with two oneyear extensions available at our option borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31 2015 the us term loan facility will mature in june 2020 with principal payments due beginning september 30 2015 as follows 750 million on a quarterly basis during the first three years 1125 million on a quarterly basis during the fourth year and 4125 million on a quarterly basis during the fifth year in 2015 we paid 5000 million in principal under the us term loan facility resulting in 25 billion in outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2015 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the credit agreement borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating or at an alternate base rate or in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 50 to 10 through june 24 2016 and no greater than 45 to 10 thereafter if our credit rating falls below investment grade additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of december 31 2015 

commitments under the credit agreement are subject to certain fees on the multicurrency revolving facility we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating 

we have a japan term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the credit agreement for 117 billion japanese yen that will mature on may 31 2018 borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 061 percent per annum until maturity 

we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 358 million 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2015 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 2731 million these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer all of these debt securities remain highly rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 

 

  

   

as of december 31 2015 9219 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the us of this amount 5647 million is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

in light of our commitments under various credit facilities as well as our expectation for continued business development we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the us in particular as a result of the biomet merger we have unremitted foreign earnings of 43879 million which we plan to repatriate to the us in future periods we have recorded a longterm liability of 14949 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 935 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2015 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to 

reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we have also excluded longterm deferred tax liabilities from this table as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 45 million 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work inprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

 

  

   

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4794 million related to the durom cup including 77 million in 2015 see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them two of these reporting units cmf and bone healing consist entirely of assets and liabilities acquired in the biomet merger since these assets and liabilities were valued at their estimated fair value on the closing date in our 2015 impairment test the carrying value approximated the fair value therefore if these reporting units perform below what we expected at the time that we estimated their fair value we may be required to record impairment charges 

our other five reporting units consist of combined zimmer and biomet assets and liabilities in our 2015 impairment test our emea reporting unit’s estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent or approximately 240 million this reporting unit’s estimated fair value has significantly decreased from prior year impairment tests due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar for our other four reporting units their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 percent 

sharebased payment – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen 

 

  

   

british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2016 through june 2018 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2015 were 14275 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2015 were 3072 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2015 were eurousd 121 usdswiss franc 091 usdjapanese yen 11244 british poundusd 159 usdcanadian dollar 122 australian dollarusd 077 usdkorean won 1125 usdswedish krona 768 usdczech koruna 2288 usdthai baht 3503 usdtaiwan dollar 3148 usdsouth african rand 1360 usdrussian ruble 6550 and usdindian ruppee 6880 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2018 

depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 20424 million at december 31 2015 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

   

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 

we have multiple fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 the total notional amounts are 2500 million and 3000 million for the senior notes due 2019 and 2021 respectively on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2019 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2021 we receive a fixed interest rate of 3375 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 99 basis points 

the interest rate swap agreements are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under gaap changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2015 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the 

amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints the ongoing financial uncertainties in the euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals as of december 31 2015 in greece italy portugal and spain countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our gross shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable combined were 2386 million with allowances for doubtful accounts of 173 million recorded in those countries the net balance was 2213 million representing 16 percent of our total consolidated shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable balance net italy and spain accounted for 1942 million of that net amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries we maintain contact with customers in these countries on a regular basis we continue to receive payments albeit at a slower rate than in the past we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 

 

  

   

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of zimmer biomet holdings inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the company acquired biomet during the second quarter of 2015 in a purchase business combination management excluded biomet from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 the company will incorporate biomet into its annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 biomet’s assets as of december 31 2015 excluded from management’s assessment were 26310 million or 10 percent of our total assets biomet’s net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 excluded from management’s assessment were 16020 million or 27 percent of our total net sales 

the company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 2013  

based on that assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2015 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 as stated in its report which appears in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

remediation of previously reported material weakness 

as discussed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2015 in the three month period ended september 30 2015 our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that 

we identified was a result of us not enhancing the level of resources and processes necessary to analyze and determine the appropriate accounting treatment of nonroutine complex transactions under gaap commensurate with the additional complexities existing subsequent to the biomet merger as a result of this material weakness we inappropriately accounted for the divestiture of certain biomet product lines and rights in the three month period ended june 30 2015 and we subsequently revised our financial statements for that period 

as of december 31 2015 we have remediated the previously reported material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we have implemented the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting that contributed to the remediation of the material weakness described above 

   based on the remedial measures taken and implemented our management has tested the applicable controls and determined that they are designed and operating effectively as a result our management has concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of december 31 2015 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as described above there were changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting also as previously noted we completed our merger with biomet on june 24 2015 we are completing the process of reviewing the internal control structure of biomet and will make appropriate changes as necessary as we integrate biomet into our overall internal control over financial reporting process

customers sales and marketing 

 

our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage our operations through three major geographic segments – the americas which is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets europe which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and african markets and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan and includes other asian and pacific markets 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals referred to as direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental 

practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product direct channel accounts represented approximately 75 percent of our net sales in 2014 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2014 

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques materials biologics and product designs the research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials biologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth 

we are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places montreal canada beijing china winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california philadelphia pennsylvania dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 1000 research and development employees worldwide 

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the

 access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulations among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion the quality system regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund payment of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices 

the fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own 

regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department 

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

further we are subject to various federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the us physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

 

  

 competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet and smith  nephew plc 

in the americas geographic segment we and the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet and smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales there are also many smaller competitors actively engaging in this market some of these smaller competitors have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than those markets in the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag a subsidiary of b braun limacorporate spa waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us many hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market we intend to continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation smith  nephew plc and biomet as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the more developed healthcare markets in the asia pacific region 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag dentsply international and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at various sites our significant manufacturing locations include warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon 

ireland and beijing china we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

the manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 10000 employees worldwide including approximately 1000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 5600 employees are located within the us 

 

  

 and approximately 4400 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 4200 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs approximately 1800 employees 

approximately 190 us employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement we 

have a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union aflcio clc for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2015

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to the proposed biomet merger and the combined company following the merger 

the following risk factors relate to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the pending biomet merger 

and the combined company following the merger the following discussion does not however contain all risks and uncertainties that relate to biomet and its business on a standalone basis which additional risks and uncertainties may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the biomet merger 

there is no assurance when or if the merger will be completed any delay in completing the merger may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the merger 

completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions there can be no assurance that we and lvb will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our control will be satisfied or waived we and lvb can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement even though lvb stockholders have approved the merger and we and lvb can also terminate the merger agreement under other specified circumstances if the merger and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are not completed within the expected timeframe such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger and could result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the merger 

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of biomet 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of biomet there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll manufacturing marketing and employee benefits while we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs following completion of the merger in 2015 that are estimated to exceed 400 million in the first two years postmerger many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all 

we and lvb may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger 

completion of the merger is conditioned upon among other conditions the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the approval of the european commission and the receipt of approval or expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable antitrust competition fair trade or similar laws of japan we and lvb are pursuing all required consents orders and approvals in accordance with the merger agreement these consents 

 

  

 orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to our or biomet’s divisions operations or assets or may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business the merger agreement requires us and lvb among other things to accept all such conditions divestitures requirements limitations costs or restrictions that may be imposed by regulatory entities such conditions divestitures requirements limitations costs or restrictions may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or may result in the abandonment of the merger further no assurance can be given that the required consents orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied and even if all such consents orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of such consents orders and approvals 

the pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on our andor biomet’s business financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the pendency of the merger could disrupt our andor biomet’s businesses in the following ways among others 

   any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of or harm the financial condition results of operations or business prospects of us andor biomet 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our future business and financial results 

if the merger is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected we will be subject to several risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure you that if the merger is not completed these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

successful integration of biomet with us and successful operation of the combined company are not assured also integrating our business with that of biomet may divert the attention of management away from operations 

if the merger is completed biomet will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours but will initially continue its operations on a basis that is separate from our operations there can be no assurance that after the merger biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations in addition the market segments in which biomet operates may experience declines in demand andor new competitors integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of biomet with ours will involve complex operational technological and personnelrelated challenges this process will be timeconsuming and expensive will disrupt the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us and biomet including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions the potential difficulties and resulting costs and delays include 

        additionally the integration of our and biomet’s operations products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources the diversion of management’s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm the combined company’s business financial condition and operating results 

we will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

in connection with the merger we entered into a 766 billion bridge credit agreement and a 435 billion bank credit agreement proceeds from the bank credit agreement and the anticipated issuance by us of up to 766 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes or if senior unsecured notes are not issued and sold prior to the closing date of the merger drawings under the bridge credit agreement will be used to finance in part the cash consideration for the merger pay fees and the expenses incurred in connection with the merger and pay off all of 

 

  

 biomet’s funded debt our debt outstanding as of december 31 2014 was approximately 143 billion and immediately after the completion of the merger the combined company’s debt is anticipated to be approximately 1209 billion as of december 31 2014 our debt service obligations comprised of principal and interest excluding capital leases and equipment notes during the next 12 months would in the absence of the merger have been approximately 640 million as a result of the increase in debt related to the merger demands on the combined company’s cash resources will increase after the completion of the merger the increased level of debt could among other things 

        if we are unable to obtain alternate financing through senior unsecured notes it is unlikely that we will be able to repay the outstanding amounts under the bridge loan at maturity on the 364th day after completion of the merger any debt incurred to refinance the bridge loan may be on unfavorable terms 

the merger may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

although we anticipate that the merger will have an immediate accretive impact on the combined company’s adjusted earnings per share this expectation is based on factors that may not be realized and estimates that may materially change we could also encounter additional transactionrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated to result from the merger in addition we expect that lvb stockholders and holders of lvb equitybased awards immediately prior to the merger will own in the aggregate approximately 16 of our outstanding shares after the merger based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock on december 31 2014 once 

additional shares are issued in the merger the combined company’s earnings per share may be lower than our adjusted earnings per share would have been in the absence of the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock there can be no assurance that any increase in adjusted earnings per share will occur even over the long term any increase in adjusted earnings per share as a result of the merger is likely to require us among other things to successfully manage the combined company’s operations to increase our consolidated earnings after the merger 

risks relating to our business regardless of whether the proposed biomet merger is consummated 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

     any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

  

 if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

       without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

        in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may 

deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the us healthcare reform law includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act was signed into law in march 2010 and mandates health insurance coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 as part of the affordable care act in january 2013 we began paying a 23 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our us sales we continue to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax we have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement under the affordable care act and other legislation nor have we been able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population the medical device excise tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the us department of treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with the excise tax statute in addition without the implementation of proper safeguards the affordable care act’s medicare payment reforms such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments could provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products accordingly while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our business ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group 

 

  

 purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations compliance with the fda’s requirements including the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and 

selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining to trilogy acetabular system products manufactured at our ponce puerto rico manufacturing facility as of december 31 2014 the warning letter remains pending until the violations are corrected we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications andor the fda may refuse to grant export certificates any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding this and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements see part ii item 8 of this report 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed 

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2014 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

    

 

  

          violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as previously reported we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom ® acetabular component  durom cup and certain products within the nexgen knee system the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation in the district of new jersey  in re zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation  and the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation in the northern district of illinois  in re zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights 

 

  

 against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations 

changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a 

 

  

 single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

the “conflict minerals” rule may adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products may increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation 

we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on june 2 2014 and are required 

to file on an annual basis going forward this rule could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability in addition we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders

executive level overview 

 

2014 results 

our 2014 sales results reflected increased growth as compared with 2013 sales from recent product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system as well as a stable joint replacement market drove sales volume and product mix growth this was partially offset by continued pricing pressure negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a yearoveryear decline in sales of our transposal fluid waste management system 

despite the increase in net sales net earnings decreased driven by increased spending on our operational excellence initiatives integration planning expenses related to the pending biomet merger a 700 million contingent legal liability recognized in 2014 and increased debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized on new debt facilities that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger 

2015 outlook 

the pending biomet merger which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2015 will have a significant impact on our 2015 operating results this report does not include guidance for 2015 on a combined company basis 

however for zimmer on a standalone basis we project that our net sales will face significant headwinds from the us dollar strengthening against the euro japanese yen and various other currencies around the world based upon recent foreign currency exchange rates additionally for net sales we expect to experience volume and mix growth from a stable joint replacement market and continued pricing pressure 

in regards to expenses on a zimmer standalone basis due to our hedging program we project that the expected decrease in net sales caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be partially offset by hedge gains to be recognized in 2015 we expect research and development rd spending will remain similar compared to prior years as a percentage of net sales for our selling general and administrative sga expenses we expect to continue to realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives however since many of our fixed sga expenses are denominated in us dollars such as corporate and business unit headquarter expenses and intangible asset amortization our sga expenses may not decrease in similar proportion to net sales decreases expected from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

   

demand volume and mix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth in 2014 which was a lower growth rate than experienced in 2013 compared to 2012 in 2013 accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products such as persona the personalized knee system and the transposal fluid waste management system in 2014 while new products continued to drive sales growth their impact on a yearoveryear basis was not as significant 

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2014 the negative 2 percent was 

consistent with prior years as we continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems for 2015 we expect continued pricing pressure similar to prior years 

foreign currency exchange rates 

for 2014 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent decrease in sales driven by the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen as well as a few other currencies in other regions in which we operate if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with december 31 2014 rates we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a greater negative effect on sales in 2015 than in 2014 we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be partially offset 

 

  

 sales by product category 

knees 

knee sales increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to a 4 percent increase in 2013 our knee product category has benefited from recent product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system and joint preservation solutions however the volumemix growth from new product introductions has been tempered by pricing pressure in all our reporting segments 

in 2014 we continued a broader launch of persona the personalized knee system we intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets for this knee system to all geographic regions in 2015 and beyond our nexgen complete knee solution product line is still our leading global knee system in terms of sales products driving growth in this category in addition to persona the personalized knee system included the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and our joint preservation solutions 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on knee sales of 5 percent and 9 percent in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

hips 

hip sales were flat in 2014 after a decline of 1 percent in 2013 positive volume and mix trends continue to be offset by pricing pressure 

leading hip stem sales were the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system  the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem and the fitmore hip stem products experiencing growth in this category included the avenir müller stem the wagner sl revision hip stem the continuum acetabular system the trilogy it acetabular system the allofit it alloclassic acetabular system vivacite highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and biolox delta heads 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on hip sales of 6 percent and 11 percent in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

extremities 

extremities sales increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to an 11 percent increase in 2013 the sales increase in both years reflected growth from our shoulder systems such as the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system and the 

sidus stemfree shoulder and a broader product portfolio to compete in the foot and ankle and hand and wrist areas of the extremities category the broader portfolio includes the zimmer trabecular metal total ankle and products from the acquisition of normed medizintechnik gmbh in june 2013 

dental 

dental sales increased 1 percent in 2014 which was the same as the prior year sales growth increased sales of dental reconstructive implants and digital solutions have been partially offset by decreases in restorative products sales were led by the tapered screwvent implant system in our dental product category in certain markets especially in our asia pacific region our customers are distributors the timing of distributor purchases can have a significant influence on sales in those markets in any particular year 

trauma 

trauma sales were flat in 2014 and increased by 2 percent in 2013 new product launches especially in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments positively affected sales in both years the zimmer natural nail system and zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales 

spine 

spine sales increased 2 percent in 2014 after a decline of 3 percent in 2013 in 2014 we continued to focus on and had success in commercializing offerings across our core fusion portfolio and market adjacencies including minimally invasive surgeries solid sales of the pathfinder nxt minimally invasive pedicle screw system and trabecular metal technology products were partially offset by a decline in sales of other spine products 

surgical and other 

surgical and other sales declined by 5 percent in 2014 after an 18 percent sales increase in 2013 the primary cause of the sales fluctuations in this product category was the transposal fluid waste management system this system is comprised of a capital equipment component that is used with a onetime use disposable manifold component in 2013 our system benefitted from commercial disruption experienced by a competitive product increasing demand for the capital equipment component with that competitive product back on the market in 2014 and since many customers bought our capital equipment component in 2013 sales of the capital equipment component decreased significantly in 2014 however this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of the related disposable manifold component other products leading sales in this category were palacos bone cement tourniquets and wound debridement devices

expenses as a percent of net sales 

 

 cost of products sold 

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2014 and 2013 compared to the prior year 

 

 the increase in gross margin percentage in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges recorded in 2013 related to products we intend to discontinue we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013 under the hedging program for 

derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings further we experienced improved product category mix resulting in lower average costs per unit sold these favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and the us medical device excise tax while we began paying the medical device excise tax in 2013 based upon the levels of inventory we were carrying before the excise tax was effective on january 1 2013 we did not recognize any significant expenses from the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013 we are in discussions with the internal revenue service irs as to what an appropriate constructive sales price used to compute our excise tax obligations should be under irs excise tax regulations and our specific business model our ultimate medical device excise tax and liability may differ from the amount we have estimated accordingly the amount we have recognized as expense is an estimate and subject to change 

the decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result of changes in product and geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue additionally lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts reduced gross margin these negative effects were partially offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012 

operating expenses 

rd expenses and rd as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization including persona the personalized knee system and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives we expect rd spending in 2015 to increase and be between 4 and 45 percent of sales as we transition our resources towards new projects as our quality and operational excellence initiatives continue to progress 

sga expenses have remained relatively consistent while sga as a percentage of sales has decreased over the last three years improvement in sga expenditures as a percentage of sales reflects the effects of our operational excellence initiatives although variable expenses naturally increase with higher sales our sga expenses as a percentage of sales has decreased due to our operational excellence initiatives which produced lower variable and fixed costs in sga as net sales increased additionally selling and distribution expenses are lower in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments compared to our americas reporting segment the mix of revenues with high sales growth in europe and asia pacific compared to the americas helped to lower sga as a percentage of sales in 2014 when compared to 2013 

 

  

 “certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries we recorded additional expense of 215 million in 2014 bringing the total recorded expense to 4203 million for these claims excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sga the additional expense recorded in 2014 was the result of new developments related to international claims activity for more information regarding these claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 960 million in 2012 we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 or 2013 as our annual goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the 2012 impairment see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

“special items” have increased significantly in the past three years the increase in 2014 was a result of higher professional fees related to the pending biomet merger increased other professional fees contract labor and dedicated project personnel related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives increased intangible asset impairments and a 700 million accrual for a certain litigation matter we continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and our information technology systems “special items” expenses include consulting and professional fees dedicated personnel costs severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs in addition to expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses impairment of assets certain rd agreements certain litigation settlements contract termination expenses and other items as “special items” see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

other expense interest income interest expense and income taxes 

other expense represents debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized for our senior credit facility and bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger 

interest income and expense net was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 in the second half of 2013 we entered into additional fixedtovariable rate interest swaps designated as fair value hedges in the 2014 periods the variable rates we paid on the swaps were lower than the fixed rate on the hedged debt and therefore interest expense decreased 

our effective tax rate etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 238 percent 226 percent and 240 percent respectively the variation of our etr has largely been affected by “special items” “certain claims” goodwill impairment charges and a 343 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring higher “special items” and “certain claims” expense favorably affect our etr because most of these expenses have been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions goodwill impairment negatively affects our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge in 2014 a portion of our “special items” were for nondeductible expenses incurred related to the pending biomet merger which increased our etr relative to 2013 in 2013 in addition to the effect of “special items” and “certain claims” our etr benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the rd tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to 2012 and 2013 due to the timing of the extension and the applicable rules of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we recognized the 2012 benefit in 2013 despite the 343 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring the 2012 etr was higher than 2014 and 2013 due to the goodwill impairment charge and lower “certain claims” and “special items” expenses the items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 

segment operating profit 

for our reporting segments operating profit increased in europe and asia pacific in 2014 compared to 2013 while in the americas it decreased the decrease in the americas was primarily from lower gross profit due to lower sales and the effect of the us medical device excise tax in europe the increase in operating profit was driven by increased sales coupled with controlled operating expenses operating expenses increased at a lower percentage compared to sales increases due to our operational excellence initiatives and the nature of fixed versus variable expenses resulting in operating margin expansion in europe the increase in operating profit in asia pacific was driven by increases in sales from volume and product mix while changes in foreign currency exchange rates tempered sales growth in asia pacific this decline was largely offset by increased hedge gains recorded in 2014 versus 2013 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts “certain claims” goodwill impairment “special items” other expenses related to financing obtained for the pending biomet merger and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with 

 

  

 these items we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 10410 million 9884 million and 9325 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 606 575 and 530 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 10528 million in 2014 compared to 9631 million in 2013 the principal source of cash from operating activities was net earnings noncash items included in net earnings accounted for another 3464 million of operating cash in 2014 all other 

items of operating cash flows reflect a use of 126 million of cash in 2014 compared to a use of 849 million in 2013 

the increased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 were primarily due to improved cash flows generated from receivables collections especially in europe lower funding necessary for our us pension plans and receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims these favorable items were partially offset by higher tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges and inventory investments 

at december 31 2014 we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable which was 1 day less than at december 31 2013 our days of sales outstanding reflect the reimbursement patterns of the healthcare industry in the markets where we compete collection of trade accounts receivable is influenced by insurance reimbursements and government budgets among other things days of sales outstanding are lowest in our americas reporting segment as the us healthcare system has a higher percentage of privatepay insurers who generally pay more quickly than governmentbased healthcare systems in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments days of sales outstanding are higher as healthcare is typically sponsored by governments which tend to pay more slowly additionally there are some seasonal trends in our days of sales outstanding as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest our days of sales outstanding in the past three years have ranged between 64 and 73 days we were at the low end of this range as of december 31 2014 due to improved collections in europe 

at december 31 2014 we had 337 days of inventory on hand an increase of 52 days compared to december 31 2013 in order to maintain high service levels to our hospital customers in numerous geographic regions we consign inventory to them including all the various sizes of a particular product so that our products are available when needed for a surgical procedure as a result we have a significant amount of inventory on hand there are some seasonal trends in our days of inventory on hand as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest other factors that can affect our days of inventory on hand include when we build inventory for new product launches or the level of excess and obsolete inventory charges and gainslosses related to foreign currency that is reported in cost of products sold in any particular period our days of inventory on hand in the past three years have ranged between 285 and 356 days as of december 31 2014 our days of inventory on hand were near the high end of this range the higher inventory balance and days of inventory on hand were driven by the ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings the effects of placing more inventory into distributor and hospital consignment and additional inventory in certain eastern european markets where we now have a direct sales presence instead of selling to a distributor 

 

  

 cash flows used in investing activities were 4694 million in 2014 compared to 2825 million in 2013 additions to instruments were relatively consistent between 2014 and 2013 as we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches such as persona the personalized knee system spending on other property plant and equipment increased in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new productrelated investments and to replace older machinery and equipment we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated debt securities the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities the timing of these investments can vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs in the past three years we have made a number of business acquisitions including etex holdings inc knee creations llc normed medizintechnik gmbh dornoch medical systems inc and synvasive technology inc 

cash flows used in financing activities were 5624 million in 2014 compared to 4673 million in 2013 in 2014 we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of 1455 million and share repurchases of 4005 million in association with the debt facilities we entered into for the pending biomet merger we incurred 641 million of debt issuance costs in 2014 2500 million of our outstanding senior notes matured and were paid additionally financing cash flows continued to benefit from our increased stock price with many employees exercising stock options 

in 2014 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 022 per share in each quarter we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change the 2014 dividend declarations equated to an annualized rate of 088 per share which represented a 10 percent increase over the 2013 annualized rate 

as of december 31 2014 5995 million remained authorized under our 10 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date due to the pending merger with biomet we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014 upon completion of the merger in the near to medium term we intend to use our cash flows for debt repayment and dividends 

as discussed more completely in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows 

also as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements we have recorded a shortterm liability of 500 million and longterm liability of 3072 million related to durom cup product liability claims we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability 

claims from insurance carriers we have received an initial amount of the insurance proceeds we estimate to recover we have a longterm receivable of 1703 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers 

we expect to fund the 1035 billion cash portion of the pending biomet merger with existing cash on hand as well as proceeds to be obtained from a 30 billion 5year unsecured term loan term loan and senior notes that we expect to issue we have also entered into a 766 billion bridge credit agreement bridge credit agreement that may be used to fund the pending merger if we are unable to issue senior notes the lenders’ commitments under the bridge credit agreement will be reduced dollarfordollar by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance of the senior notes 

currently we have three tranches of senior notes outstanding 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent notes due november 30 2019 300 million aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent notes due november 30 2021 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 percent notes due november 30 2039 interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity 

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

we have a senior credit facility senior credit facility that contains i the 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 30 billion and ii a 5year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility multicurrency revolving facility in the principal amount of 135 billion the senior credit facility replaces a previous credit agreement that provided for a 135 billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in may 2017 the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019 with two oneyear extensions available at our option borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31 2014 the availability of the term loan is conditioned on among other things the consummation of the biomet merger the term loan will mature five years after the initial borrowing borrowings under the term loan may only be used by us to fund in part the biomet merger including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger we must reduce unused commitments under the term loan and prepay the borrowings under the term loan with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed 

 

  

 money indebtedness subject to certain exceptions the commitments under the term loan automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of i the funding and disbursement of term loan funds to us ii april 24 2015 as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement or iii termination of the merger agreement 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating or at an alternate base rate or in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only at a fixedrate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 30 to 10 in periods prior to any term loan funding and no greater than 50 to 10 in periods after the term loan is funded if our credit rating falls below investment grade additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2014 

commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees on the multicurrency revolving facility we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating on the term loan we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23 2014 through the day the commitments under the term loan terminate 

the bridge credit agreement is a 364day unsecured committed bridge facility in the principal amount of 766 billion funding of loans under the bridge credit agreement is conditioned on among other things the consummation of the biomet merger any loans under the bridge credit agreement will mature 364 days after the funding date of the loans the bridge credit agreement requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness such as new senior notes we intend to issue subject to certain exceptions commitments under the bridge credit agreement automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of i the funding and disbursement of the loans ii april 24 2015 as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement or iii termination of the merger agreement proceeds of loans under the bridge credit agreement may only be used to fund in part the biomet merger including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger 

zimmer holdings is the borrower under the bridge credit agreement borrowings under the bridge credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon libor plus an 

applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating or at an alternate base rate the bridge credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 50 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants under the bridge credit agreement as of december 31 2014 if our credit rating falls below investment grade additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends 

we will pay a funding fee if we borrow under the bridge credit agreement as well as duration fees based on the outstanding principal amount of the loans in the amount and on the dates specified in the bridge credit agreement in addition we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23 2014 through the day the commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminate 

we have a term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for 117 billion japanese yen japan term loan that will mature on may 31 2018 borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 061 percent per annum until maturity 

we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 319 million 

we currently have investment grade credit ratings from standard and poor’s ratings services sp of a and moody’s investor services moody’s of baa1 after the announcement of the biomet merger sp placed a creditwatch with negative implications on our rating and has indicated that it expects to lower our rating to bbb if the merger is completed moody’s placed our rating on review for downgrade and expects to lower our rating to baa3 if the merger is completed 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2014 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 8689 million these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer all of these debt securities remain highlyrated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 

as of december 31 2014 10901 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations repatriation of these assets to the us may have tax consequences 8440 million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

 

  

 management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs and to fund our pending merger with biomet as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends should additional investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 633 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2014 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2015 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits additionally other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet include longterm deferred tax liabilities primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed assets we have excluded these liabilities from this table as well as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 60 million 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes  our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the 

 

  

 status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4717 million related to the durom cup including 215 million in 2014 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using a weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 

as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of 960 million in 2012 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment in 2014 and 2013 we employed a similar combination of income and market approaches to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value and determined there were no 

impairment charges necessary for our annual impairment test in 2014 the goodwill balance of the us spine reporting unit was 410 million due to improved operating performance of our us spine reporting unit and improving macroenomic conditions including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach the us spine reporting unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent for our 2014 impairment test our international spine goodwill and related net assets are not tested separately for goodwill impairment as they are part of reporting units that contain other product categories 

we have four other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them our 2013 annual impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the us dental reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 11 percent for the annual impairment test in 2014 the goodwill balance of the us dental reporting unit was 1691 million in our 2014 annual impairment test due to improved operating performance and improving macroenomic conditions including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach the us dental reporting unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent 

in 2014 for our three other reporting units’ annual impairment test we performed a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the 2013 income approach a qualitative assessment was performed because the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets in the 2013 impairment test 

sharebased payment – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity 

 

  

 prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2015 through june 2017 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2014 were 12898 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2014 were 3063 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2014 were eurousd 134 usdswiss franc 091 usdjapanese yen 9730 british poundusd 162 usdcanadian dollar 108 australian dollarusd 089 usdkorean won 1115 usdswedish krona 674 usdczech koruna 1998 usdthai baht 3301 usdtaiwan dollar 2948 usdsouth african rand 1111 usdrussian ruble 3737 and usdindian ruppee 6714 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash 

flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2014 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2017 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 21135 million at december 31 2014 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 12210 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2014 related to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

 

  

 commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 

we have multiple fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 the total notional amounts are 250 million and 300 million for the senior notes due 2019 and 2021 respectively on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2019 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2021 we receive a fixed interest rate of 3375 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 99 basis points 

the interest rate swap agreements are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under gaap changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

in 2014 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that we have designated as cash flow hedges of our anticipated issuance of senior notes related to the pending biomet merger that we anticipate will mature in march 2045 

the forward starting interest rate swaps mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates prior to completion of the senior notes offering the total notional amounts of the forward starting interest rate swaps are 1 billion and will settle in march 2015 on the forward starting interest rate swaps we receive variable interest equal to threemonth libor and pay a fixed interest weighted average rate of 301 percent we will defer the effective portion of the forward starting interest rate swaps over the maturity period of the hedged senior notes which is thirty years and recognize any ineffective portion immediately in earnings 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2014 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries 

 

  

 we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints the ongoing financial uncertainties in the euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals as of december 31 2014 in greece italy portugal and spain countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our gross shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable combined were 1831 million with allowances for doubtful accounts of 94 million recorded in those countries the net balance was 1737 million representing 20 percent of our total consolidated shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable balance net italy and spain accounted for 1644 million of that net amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries we maintain contact with 

customers in these countries on a regular basis we continue to receive payments albeit at a slower rate than in the past we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

research and development 

 

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques materials biologics and product designs the research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials biologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth 

we are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places montreal canada beijing china winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california philadelphia pennsylvania dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2013 we employed nearly 1000 research and development employees worldwide 

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

 

  

   

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulations among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion the quality system regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund payment of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices 

the fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department 

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european 

notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

further we are subject to various federal state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws as well as the physician payments sunshine act and similar state and healthcare professional payment transparency laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc and smith  nephew plc 

in the americas geographic segment we and the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet inc and smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales there are also many smaller competitors actively engaging in this market some of these smaller competitors have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than those markets in the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag 

 

  

   

a subsidiary of b braun waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us many hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market we intend to continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation smith  nephew plc and biomet inc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the more developed healthcare markets in the asia pacific region 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag dentsply international and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet inc 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality price reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at various sites our significant manufacturing locations include warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon ireland and beijing china we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 9500 employees worldwide including nearly 1000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 5200 employees are located within the us and approximately 4300 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 3900 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs approximately 1600 employees 

approximately 180 us employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement we have a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union aflcio clc for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2015

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

    

any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

       without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

        in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their 

 

  

   

patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the us healthcare reform legislation includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act was signed into law in march 2010 and mandates health insurance coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 as part of the affordable care act in january 2013 we began paying a 23 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our us sales we continue to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax we are not able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement under the affordable care act and other legislation nor are we able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population the medical device excise tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the us department of treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with the excise tax statute in addition without the implementation of proper safeguards the affordable care act’s medicare payment reforms such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments could provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products accordingly while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our business ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations compliance with the fda’s requirements including the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal 

 

  

   

penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed 

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our industry is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal false claims act the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

the “conflict minerals” rule may adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products may increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation 

we are subject to the sec’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” tantalum tin and tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries us public companies that manufacture products that contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of their products must annually disclose whether the minerals in their products originated from one of these countries and the procedures employed to determine the sourcing of such minerals these requirements became effective for the 2013 calendar year with initial disclosure reports due in may 2014 we are incurring costs to comply with this rule including for diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from our suppliers or that we will be able to determine that all of our products are conflictfree as a result we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products this rule also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at competitive prices which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2013 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

              violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on 

 

  

   

foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

challenging global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations 

since 2008 the global economy has been impacted by an ongoing series of financial crises although the us economy is recovering unemployment remains high and consumer confidence remains low resulting in reduced numbers of insured patients and the deferral of elective reconstructive procedures global economic conditions particularly in europe our secondlargest operating segment remain uncertain we believe that european austerity measures implemented to address the ongoing financial crisis contributed to decreased healthcare utilization and increased pricing pressure for some of our products we cannot assure you that challenges in the global economy will not continue to negatively impact procedure volumes average selling prices and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payors any of which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we have experienced delays in the collection of receivables from hospitals in certain countries that have national healthcare systems including certain regions in spain italy greece and portugal which are the countries most directly affected by the euro zone crisis repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries further there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the euro as a single currency continuing high unemployment in the us a worsening of the european financial situation or a failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our european receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as previously reported we temporarily suspended 

the marketing and distribution of our durom ® acetabular component  durom cup in the us in july 2008 subsequently a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted against us we have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending additional claims may be asserted in the future we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly at any given time we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property these patents trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently 

 

  

   

broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of nondisclosure and other agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or 

outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future 

 

  

   

any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following

executive level overview 

 

2013 results 

our 2013 sales results reflected increased growth as compared with 2012 trends sales from new product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system and the transposal fluid waste management system as well as a stable or slightly improved joint replacement market drove sales volume and product mix growth this was partially offset by continued pricing pressure as well as negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

our gross profit declined slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 we realized lower gross margins caused by excess and obsolete inventory charges for products we intend to discontinue as well as a higher mix of lower margin product and geographic revenues 

operating expenses increased by 26 million in 2013 while operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2013 relative to 2012 we incurred higher selling expenses “certain claims” and “special items” in 2013 relative to 2012 but we did not incur a goodwill impairment charge in 2013 whereas in 2012 we recorded a 960 million goodwill impairment charge the selling expense increase was due to sales growth “certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries “special items” are primarily related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives which are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and information technology systems 

our effective tax rate etr benefited from changes in the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions the significant expenses for our excess and obsolete inventory charges “certain claims” and “special items” were primarily incurred in jurisdictions with higher rates of tax which lowered taxable income in those jurisdictions 

sales increased 3 percent in 2013 relative to 2012 while net earnings increased 1 percent net earnings grew at a slower pace than sales primarily due to lower gross profit 

2014 outlook 

we estimate our net sales will grow between 25 and 45 percent in 2014 this assumes the market for knee and hip procedures will remain stable and grow in the low to mid 

single digits we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of between 2 and 3 percent and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of between 0 and 1 percent based upon december 31 2013 rates 

assuming currency rates remain at december 31 2013 levels we expect our gross margin to be between 73 and 74 percent of sales in 2014 this range assumes that foreign currency hedge gains will be higher in 2014 than in 2013 the range also takes into consideration the full year impact of the 23 percent medical device excise tax on a majority of our us sales pursuant to the tax regulations the excise tax is imposed on the first sale in the us by the manufacturer producer or importer of a medical device to either a third party or an affiliated distribution entity we distribute a majority of our musculoskeletal products through an affiliated distribution entity under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excise taxes incurred to transfer inventory to its current location can be included in the cost of the inventory accordingly a majority of the excise tax will be capitalized in inventory and the expense will be deferred until that inventory is sold on a firstin firstout basis based upon the levels of inventory we were carrying before the medical device excise tax was effective we did not recognize any of the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013 the excise tax is derived from a constructive sales price as defined by us tax law and internal revenue service irs guidance prior to the medical device excise tax effective date the irs issued interim rules see irs notice 201277 that provide among other things that medical device manufacturers selling to an affiliated distribution entity may apply a 2875 discount off retail selling prices when computing the tax base we are in discussions with the irs as to what an appropriate constructive sales price should be under irs excise tax regulations and our specific business model as a result of our discussions with the irs our ultimate medical device excise tax may differ from the amount determined under notice 201277 we estimate the cost in 2014 will be approximately 10 million per quarter since we recognize the medical device excise tax as a part of the cost of inventory the amount expensed in any particular quarter will vary according to us sales levels in that quarter 

we expect to continue making investments in research and development rd of between 4 and 45 percent of sales in 2014 selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 385 and 39 percent in 2014 as we realize efficiencies from our quality and operational excellence initiatives and further leverage revenue growth 

we expect to incur approximately 250 million of expenses in 2014 related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives and integration costs from recent acquisitions the quality and operational excellence programs are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and information technology systems we expect to recognize the 

 

  

   

majority of these expenses in “special items” on our statement of earnings but some will be related to inventory and be reflected in costs of products sold 

assuming variable interest rates remain at december 31 2013 levels we expect interest income and expense net to be similar to 2013 

we expect our etr to increase in 2014 relative to 2013 as we do not anticipate certain significant costs such as excess and obsolete inventory charges and “certain claims” 

that were incurred in jurisdictions with higher tax rates to recur thus increasing the profit in those higher tax jurisdictions 

based upon the above we expect reported net earnings and diluted earnings per share to increase in a range of approximately 13 to 17 percent in 2014 relative to 2013 stemming from anticipated higher sales and an improved gross margin

beginning in 2013 our knees product category net sales include certain early intervention products that are primarily used in knee procedures in 2012 and 2011 these products were included in the surgical and other product category net sales in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 related to these products have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation 

the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

   

   

demand volume and mix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 7 percentage points of yearoveryear sales growth in 2013 which is a higher growth rate than experienced in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2013 accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products such as persona the personalized knee system and the transposal fluid waste management system 

we believe procedure volumes in the broader musculoskeletal market remained stable or improved slightly in 2013 relative to 2012 we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices will continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value in these advanced technologies 

pricing trends 

global selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on yearoveryear sales during 2013 our americas and europe reporting segments and certain countries in our asia pacific reporting segment continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems for 2014 we estimate that selling prices will decline slightly more than they did in 2013 due to a biennial price adjustment in japan in the second quarter of 2014 along with some moderately weaker pricing in europe overall we estimate prices will have a negative effect of 2 to 3 percent on yearoveryear sales in 2014 

foreign currency exchange rates 

for 2013 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent decrease in sales primarily from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen in the period if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with december 31 2013 rates we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect on sales in 2014 of 0 to 1 percent we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

knees 

knee sales increased 4 percent in 2013 compared to flat sales in 2012 our knee product category has benefited from new product introductions such as persona the personalized knee system and early intervention products as well as increased procedure volumes in the market we are cautiously optimistic that volumemix trends will continue to remain stable in 2014 

in 2013 we continued a broader launch of persona the personalized knee system we intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets to all geographic regions during 2014 and beyond in the meantime our nexgen complete knee solution product line is still our leading knee system in terms of sales products driving growth in this category in 2013 in addition to persona the personalized knee system included zimmer patient specific instruments the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and our early intervention products 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2013 and 2012 by positive 2 percent and negative 6 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative 9 percent effect on knee sales in 2013 and a minimal effect in 2012 

hips 

hip sales declined by 1 percent in each of the last two years we believe that industry procedure volumes were stable or improved slightly in 2013 while pricing was negative as compared to our knee product category our overall hip product category is more exposed to certain negative factors in europe and asia pacific as we derive a higher percentage of total hip sales in those regions when compared to our knee business more specifically europe continues to be a difficult market with government budget constraints in asia pacific the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen caused a significant decline in asia pacific hip sales in 2013 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2013 and 2012 by positive 2 percent and negative 6 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2013 and 2012 by negative 11 percent and positive 1 percent respectively 

leading hip stem sales were the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem products experiencing growth in this category included the wagner sl revision ® hip stem the continuum acetabular system the trilogy it acetabular system the allofit it alloclassic acetabular system vivacite ® highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and biolox ® 4 delta heads 

extremities 

extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system the sidus ® stemfree shoulder and the zimmer trabecular metal total ankle drove sales growth trabecular metal technology continues to be an effective way to address clinical needs in the extremities market additionally our acquisition of normed medizintechnik gmbh in june 2013 contributed to growth in this product category

dental 

dental sales increased 1 percent in 2013 after a 4 percent decline in 2012 while the americas dental sales increased in 2012 the overall performance of our dental franchise was impacted by several factors including softening in certain international markets and lower inventory levels maintained by our stocking distributors in 2013 the effects of those negative factors in 2012 were less pronounced which resulted in slightly improved sales of dental reconstructive implants and digital solutions offset by decreases in restorative products and regenerative products we believe the dental market continues to be challenged both in the us and internationally dental sales in 2013 were led by the tapered screwvent implant system 

trauma 

trauma sales increased by 2 percent and 8 percent in 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the same prior year periods in this product category changes in foreign exchange rates had a greater negative impact on 2013 sales than in our other product categories due to the geographic mix of our trauma sales revenue the zimmer natural nail system continued to increase sales significantly however this increase was partially at the expense of our other intramedullary nail systems in addition to the zimmer natural nail system the zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales 

spine 

we experienced midsingle digit sales declines in spine each of the past two years this product category continues to face challenges related to pricing pressure and payor approval in 2013 solid sales of the pathfinder nxt minimally invasive pedicle screw system and trabecular metal technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys dynamic stabilization system the trinica select anterior cervical plate system and other spine products 

surgical and other 

surgical and other jumped to an 18 percent sales increase in 2013 after a 9 percent increase in 2012 the primary driver of sales growth in this product category was the transposal fluid waste management system which we acquired through our acquisition of dornoch medical systems inc in october 2012 other contributing products were palacos ® 5 bone cement tourniquets and wound debridement devices

expenses as a percent of net sales 

 

 cost of products sold 

the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2013 and 2012 compared to the prior year 

 

 the decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result of changes in product and geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue additionally lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts reduced gross margin these negative effects were partially 

 

  

   

offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012 the gains were primarily the result of the us dollar strengthening against the japanese yen under the program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings 

gross margin was the same in 2012 compared to 2011 our foreign currency hedging program also had a favorable impact on gross margin in 2012 additionally lower inventory stepup charges from acquisitions were recognized in 2012 when compared to 2011 based on the timing of acquisitions this favorability was offset by the effect of lower prices on gross margin 

operating expenses 

rd expenses and rd as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved full commercialization including persona the personalized knee system and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives we expect rd spending in 2014 to be between 4 and 45 percent of sales 

sga expenses increased but sga as a percentage of sales decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 the dollar increase was primarily due to higher selling and distribution expenses from higher sales and increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions this was partially offset by lower bad debt expenses as well as lower legal expenses due to the conclusion of certain matters for which we are no longer incurring legal expenses as well as normal variations in the phases of litigation including product liability litigation as a percentage of sales sga decreased 70 basis points in 2013 as our quality and operational excellence initiatives have produced lower variable and fixed costs in sga as well as the natural leverage that occurs when sales increase against our fixed costs such as fixed intangible asset amortization from past acquisitions 

in 2012 sga decreased in dollar terms and as a percent of sales changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to 2011 rates lowered sga expense especially in europe absent the effects of foreign currency exchange rates selling and distribution expenses were higher due to higher sales other unfavorable items included increased intangible asset amortization from business combinations higher employee recruiting and relocation costs increased legal costs and higher bad debt expense these were offset by favorable product liability claims lower instrument excess and obsolescence charges and lower advertising spend sga as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 for similar reasons noted in 2013 

“certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries we recorded expense of 150 million 1578 million 750 million 350 million and 690 million during 2012 2011 

2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we recorded additional expense of 470 million in 2013 bringing the total recorded expense to 3988 million for these claims excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sga the additional expense recorded in 2013 was driven primarily by more estimated claims than were previously expected the additional expense in 2012 was primarily for more estimated claims outside the us than were previously expected as well as higher estimated legal costs for more information regarding these claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 960 million in 2012 we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2013 as our annual goodwill impairment test revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the 2012 impairment see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

“special items” have increased significantly in the past three years we continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and our information technology systems “special items” expenses include consulting and professional fees dedicated personnel costs severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs in addition to expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses impairment of assets certain rd agreements certain litigation settlements contract termination expenses and other items as “special items” see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

interest income interest expense income taxes and net earnings 

interest income and expense net were similar in 2013 and 2012 after an increase from 2011 interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 550 million offering of senior notes we completed in november 2012 

our etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 226 percent 240 percent and 224 percent respectively the variation of our etr has largely been affected by “special items” “certain claims” goodwill impairment charges and a 343 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring higher “special items” and “certain claims” expense favorably affect our etr because these expenses have mostly been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates resulting in lower taxable income in 

 

  

   

these higher tax jurisdictions goodwill impairment negatively affects our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge in 2013 in addition to the effect of “special items” and “certain claims” our etr benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the rd tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to the 2012 and 2013 periods due to the timing of the extension and the applicable gaap rules we recognized the 2012 benefit in the 2013 period additionally in 2011 our etr was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies the items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 

as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously net earnings in 2013 increased 1 percent compared to 2012 in 2012 net earnings decreased 1 percent compared to 2011 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 4 percent and 3 percent respectively in 2013 compared to 2012 while 2012 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 7 percent and 6 percent respectively compared to 2011 the disproportionate changes in earnings per share as compared to net earnings are attributed to the effect of share repurchases 

for our reporting segments operating profit increased each year in the americas and asia pacific while in europe it has decreased over those same time periods the increase in the americas is indicative of increasing sales in the geographic region in europe and asia pacific operating profit is impacted by foreign currency exchange rates in europe the decline in operating profit from 2011 to 2012 was primarily related to a 3 percent decline in sales a 6 percent decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates offset by a 3 percent increase from the combination of volumemix and price in 2013 while sales did increase by 3 percent a 2 percent increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 1 percent increase from the combination of volumemix and price the higher sales were largely offset by hedge losses recorded in the 2013 period versus hedge gains recorded in the 2012 period additionally operating profit in europe declined due to continuing price pressure in those markets as well as a change in the mix of sales to higher growth markets with lower operating profit margins in asia pacific the increase in operating profit from 2011 to 2012 was driven by higher sales the increase in operating profit in asia pacific from 2012 to 2013 was driven by the 8 percent increase in sales from volumemix while changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 10 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 this decline was largely offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 versus hedge losses recorded in 2012 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts inventory obsolescence charges associated with products we intend to discontinue “certain claims” “special items” and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items 

in addition to certain other tax adjustments we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 9884 million 9325 million and 9056 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 575 530 and 480 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 9631 million in 2013 compared to 11519 million in 2012 the principal source of cash from operating activities in 2013 was net earnings noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 2888 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows in 2013 were outflows of 849 million of cash the lower cash flows provided by operating activities in the 2013 period were primarily due to increases in inventory caused by the medical device excise tax and inventory investments to support new product launches additionally cash flows were unfavorable compared to the 

 

  

   

prior year due to spending on our quality and operational excellence initiatives these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower product liability payments for durom cup claims and lower funding required on our us pension plans for 2013 

at december 31 2013 we had 65 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable which was higher by one day compared to december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 we had 285 days of inventory on hand a decrease of 16 days compared to december 31 2012 we consider the changes in days of sales outstanding and days of inventory on hand as normal fluctuations for our business 

cash flows used in investing activities were 2825 million in 2013 compared to 5921 million in 2012 additions to instruments increased in 2013 due to purchases for significant product launches such as persona the personalized knee system spending on other property plant and equipment was relatively consistent in 2013 relative to 2012 reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new productrelated investments and replace older machinery and equipment in 2014 instrument additions are expected to be in a range of 200 to 210 million as part of our ongoing launch of persona the personalized knee system property plant and equipment additions are expected to be approximately 150 million in 2014 reflecting the cash outlays necessary to update and modernize our manufacturing capabilities and support new product developments and commercialization activities we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated debt securities the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities the timing of these investments can vary from year to year depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs in the past three years we have made a number of business acquisitions including knee creations llc normed medizintechnik gmbh dornoch medical systems inc synvasive technology inc extraortho inc and certain foreignbased distributors 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4673 million in 2013 compared to 4365 million in 2012 in 2013 we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of 1324 million and share repurchases of 7190 million additionally an increase in our stock price in 2013 resulted in many employees exercising stock options which provided us with additional cash in 2012 we converted some of the outstanding debt under our senior credit facility to a term loan and we borrowed 1000 million to repurchase shares as well as fund other corporate cash needs in 2013 we paid off the amount we had borrowed under our senior credit facility 

in 2013 we declared cash dividends in each quarter of 020 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change the 2013 dividend declarations equate to an annual rate of 080 per share which represents an 11 percent increase over the 2012 annualized rate 

as discussed more completely in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain we anticipate that within the next twelve months we may settle certain tax matters with the irs and pay amounts for other unresolved tax matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges such payments may be significant to our 2014 operating cash flows 

as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements we are defending a patent infringement lawsuit in which the trial court awarded the plaintiff 2100 million in damages plus interest and attorneys’ fees we have filed a notice of appeal and have not recorded a liability because we do not believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss although we believe we have strong grounds to reverse the trial court’s judgment we could be required to pay 2100 million plus interest and attorneys’ fees in the future 

also as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements we have recorded a shortterm liability of 500 million and longterm liability of 3290 million related to durom cup product liability claims we expect to continue paying these claims over the next five years we have also recorded a longterm receivable of 2180 million that we expect to receive from insurance carriers once we reach our selfinsured retention under our insurance programs 

we have four tranches of senior notes outstanding 250 million aggregate principal amount of 14 percent notes due november 30 2014 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent notes due november 30 2019 300 million aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent notes due november 30 2021 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 percent notes due november 30 2039 interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity 

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

before our senior notes due november 30 2014 become payable we intend to issue new senior notes in order to pay the 250 million owed if we are not able to issue new senior notes we intend to borrow against our senior credit facility to pay these notes 

 

  

   

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing may 9 2017 senior credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2013 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixedrate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales or transfers of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2013 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility fee and a utilization fee 

we have a term loan agreement term loan with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for 117 billion japanese yen that will mature on may 31 2016 borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 061 percent per annum until maturity 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 507 million 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2013 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 8077 million these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer all of these debt securities remain highlyrated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 

as of december 31 2013 8919 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations repatriation of these assets to the us may have tax consequences 4788 million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

we may use excess cash to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program effective january 1 2014 we have a new share repurchase program that authorizes purchases of up to 10 billion with no expiration date no further purchases will be made under the previous share repurchase program 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 214 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2013 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2014 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits additionally other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet include longterm deferred tax liabilities primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed assets we have excluded these liabilities from this table as well as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these taxrelated accounts 

 

  

   

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 45 million 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all 

relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4502 million related to the durom cup including 470 million in 2013 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 

as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of 960 million in 2012 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment in 2013 we employed a similar combination of 

 

  

   

income and market approaches to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value and determined there was no impairment charge in 2013 

we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year’s income approach since in the past we have incurred goodwill impairment charges for our us spine reporting unit which required us to decrease goodwill to its implied fair value the estimated fair value of this reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value additionally due to challenging market conditions associated with our us dental reporting unit that reporting unit’s estimated fair value did not substantially exceed its carrying value either these two reporting units remain sensitive to changes in market conditions which could result in goodwill being impaired in the future for each of our other four reporting units the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value 

sharebased payment – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2014 through june 2016 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2013 were 15746 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2013 were 3533 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2013 were eurousd 132 swiss francusd 109 usdjapanese yen 8813 british poundusd 156 usdcanadian dollar 104 australian dollarusd 094 usdkorean won 1154 usdswedish krona 678 usdczech koruna 1941 usdthai baht 3206 usdtaiwan dollar 2922 usdsouth african rand 1005 usdrussian ruble 3447 and usdindian ruppee 6258 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts 

 

  

   

outstanding at december 31 2013 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2016 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we have net assets in legal entities with nonus dollar functional currencies of 22956 million at december 31 2013 primarily in euros japanese yen and australian dollars 13543 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2013 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price 

change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 

we have multiple fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 the total notional amounts are 250 million and 300 million for the senior notes due 2019 and 2021 respectively on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2019 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points on the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2021 we receive a fixed interest rate of 3375 percent and pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 99 basis points 

the interest rate swap agreements are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under gaap changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2013 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash 

 

  

   

equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these 

hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints the ongoing financial uncertainties in the euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals as of december 31 2013 in greece italy portugal and spain countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our gross shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable combined were 2264 million with allowances for doubtful accounts of 95 million recorded in those countries the net balance was 2169 million representing 24 percent of our total consolidated shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable balance net italy and spain accounted for 2097 million of that net amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries we maintain contact with customers in these countries on a regular basis we continue to receive payments albeit at a slower rate than in the past we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate

customers sales and marketing 

 

our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons dentists hospitals stocking distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists 

we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage our operations through three major geographic segments – the americas which is comprised principally of the us and includes other north central and south american markets europe which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and africa markets and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan and australia and includes other asian and pacific markets 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals or direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product direct channel accounts represented approximately 75 percent of our net sales in 2012 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2012 

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel most of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons neurosurgeons dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 

 

3 registered trademark of seikagaku corporation 

 

  

   

device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of some devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulations among other fda requirements such as restrictions on advertising and promotion the quality system regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund payment of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices 

the fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice 

the fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance we are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department 

there are also requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include the depuy synthes companies of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and tornier inc 

 

  

   

in the americas geographic segment we and the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc and wright medical group inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag a subsidiary of b braun waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us many hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market we intend to continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation smith  nephew plc and biomet inc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc the depuy synthes companies stryker corporation biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc nuvasive inc and globus medical inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag dentsply international and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet inc 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at various sites our significant manufacturing locations include warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon ireland and beijing china we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous 

improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2012 we employed more than 9300 employees worldwide including more than 1000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 5000 employees are located within the us and approximately 4300 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 3800 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs approximately 1500 employees 

 

  

   

approximately 150 us employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement we have a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied 

industrial and service workers international union aflcio clc for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2015

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our 

business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

     any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

       without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

 

  

   

     in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

us healthcare reform legislation includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as the 2010 us healthcare law continues to be phased in we believe the law will have an impact on various aspects of our business operations imposition of the 23 percent medical device excise tax effective 2013 has forced and will continue to force us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the expected earnings impact due to the tax we do not expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement per the healthcare law and the recently enacted fiscal cliff legislation nor do we expect to be able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population the medical device excise tax regulations and interim guidance issued late 2012 by the us department of treasury did little to lessen the burden of complying with the excise tax statute in addition the law’s medicare payment reforms such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments could provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products accordingly while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the ultimate impact of the law on our business ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to 

 

  

   

market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations compliance with the fda’s requirements including the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action or other forms of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of payment of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products may increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation 

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten or gold known as conflict minerals if these minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the company’s products these regulations require such companies to report annually whether or not the minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for the minerals the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of medical devices including our products in addition we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products since our supply chain is complex the procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free which may harm our reputation these new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals and we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at competitive prices which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

       

 

  

   

      violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

challenging global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2012 growth in the healthcare industry and our revenue growth were adversely affected by continuing challenges in the global economy although the us economy is recovering from the worst recession in decades unemployment remains high and consumer confidence remains low resulting in reduced numbers of insured patients and the deferral of elective reconstructive procedures global economic conditions particularly in europe our secondlargest operating segment remain uncertain we believe that european austerity measures implemented to address the ongoing financial crisis contributed to decreased healthcare utilization and increased pricing pressure for some of our products we cannot assure you that challenges in the global economy will not continue to negatively impact procedure volumes average selling prices and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payors any of which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we have experienced delays in the collection of receivables from hospitals in certain countries that have national healthcare systems including certain regions in spain italy greece and portugal which are 

the countries most directly affected by the euro zone crisis repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries continuing high unemployment in the us a worsening of the european financial crisis or a failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our european receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as previously reported we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our durom ® acetabular component  durom cup in the us in july 2008 subsequently a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted against us we have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending additional claims may be asserted in the future we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

   

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

the us patent and trademark office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents future changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 

pending and future intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of 

management and key personnel from other business issues if we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights such loss could result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data our business could be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new 

 

  

   

business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information in addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption 

or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following

executive level overview 

 

2012 results 

our 2012 results reflect what we believe was above market sales growth in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments and below market growth in our americas reporting segment in the musculoskeletal markets in which we compete as a result 2012 net sales were flat when compared to 2011 we believe 2012 net sales reflected strong commercial execution in the europe and asia pacific reporting segments and underperformance in some areas of the americas reporting segment we are focusing on improving those areas 

during 2012 we made substantial investments in a series of operational excellence initiatives we began implementing these initiatives on a companywide basis in 2010 they are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and our information technology systems we began realizing savings from these operational initiatives in 2012 as indicated in the 80 basis point decline in our selling general and administrative sga expense as a percent of sales additionally research and development rd spending was lower in 2012 as we completed certain significant projects and realized some operational savings from these initiatives 

we also recognized unanticipated expenses in 2012 for goodwill impairment related to our us spine operations and “certain claims” however this was partially offset by a favorable effective tax rate we recorded a 343 million net tax benefit related to restructuring of certain international operations that resulted in the lower tax rate 

in total our 2012 net earnings were slightly lower than 2011 primarily due to the significant investments in our operational excellence initiatives and were lower than we expected primarily due to the goodwill impairment 

2013 outlook 

we estimate our net sales will grow between 2 and 4 percent in 2013 this assumes the market for knee and hip procedures will remain stable and grow in low single digits we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately 2 percent and foreign currency exchange rates 

to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately 05 percent based upon december 31 2012 rates 

assuming currency rates remain at december 31 2012 levels we expect our gross margin to be between 745 and 755 percent of sales in 2013 this range assumes that foreign currency hedge losses will be lower in 2013 than in 2012 the range also takes into consideration the impact of the new 23 percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales resulting from us healthcare reform pursuant to the tax regulations the excise tax is imposed on the first sale in the us by the manufacturer producer or importer of a medical device to either a third party or an affiliated distribution entity we distribute a majority of our musculoskeletal products through an affiliated distribution entity under us gaap excise taxes incurred to get inventory to its current location can be included in the cost of the inventory accordingly a majority of the excise tax will be capitalized in inventory and the expense will be deferred until that inventory is sold on a firstinfirstout basis therefore while we started paying the tax in january 2013 it will not significantly increase our cost of products sold expense in our consolidated statement of earnings until later in the year once our cost of products sold starts reflecting this excise tax we estimate the cost to be 10 to 15 million on a quarterly basis the range of 745 to 755 percent does not take into consideration inventory stepup or other inventory charges related to acquisitions or operational excellence initiatives in 2013 

we do not expect to be able to offset the full impact of the excise tax on net earnings through higher pricing on our products or through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage however we do expect to offset the tax with cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives 

we expect to continue making investments in rd of approximately 5 percent of sales in 2013 sga as a percent of sales is expected to be between 395 and 400 percent in 2013 as we realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives and further leverage revenue growth 

we expect to incur 120 to 130 million of expenses in 2013 related to our operational excellence initiatives these programs are targeted at streamlining the organization and business processes they are expected to be mostly completed in 2013 we also expect to incur 5 to 15 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions we expect to recognize the majority of these expenses in “special items” on our statement of earnings but some will be related to inventory and be reflected in costs of products sold the gross margin and sga percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 

assuming variable interest rates remain at december 31 2012 levels we expect interest income and expense net to be approximately 60 million in 2013 which is similar to 2012

the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

   

   

demand volume and mix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of 2012 sales growth which is the same rate of growth from 2011 compared to 2010 

consistent with our expectations procedure volumes in the broader musculoskeletal market remained stable in 2012 relative to 2011 at low to midsingle digit growth rates we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the ongoing shift in demand to premium products and the introduction of patient specific devices is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 

pricing trends 

global average selling prices declined by 2 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 in all reporting segments we continued to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems for example in japan a biennial price adjustment went into effect in april 2012 which lowered pricing the japan downward price adjustment was greater than we had anticipated coming into the year for 2013 we estimate that selling prices will have a negative effect of approximately 2 percent 

foreign currency exchange rates 

for 2012 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent decline in sales this was most notable in europe due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro yearoveryear if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2012 year end rates we estimate that a stronger us dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2013 of approximately 05 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

knees 

knee sales experienced a 1 percent decline in 2012 compared to a 2 percent increase in 2011 however most of that change was caused by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2012 and 2011 by negative 6 percent and positive 4 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal effect on knee sales in 2012 and had a positive 9 percent effect in 2011 

we estimate that industry procedure volumes were slightly positive on a global basis in 2012 while pricing was negative we also believe our europe and asia pacific reporting segments grew above the market but in the americas we were lower than the market due to underperformance in some areas we are cautiously optimistic that volumemix trends will continue to remain stable in 2013 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions ® knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee and the nexgen crflex knee led knee sales in 2012 in addition sales of our knee revision systems the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and zimmer patient specific instruments exhibited growth 

hips 

hip sales declined by 1 percent in 2012 compared to an increase of 7 percent in 2011 a significant portion of that change was caused by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2012 and 2011 by negative 6 percent and positive 6 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in 2012 and 2011 by 1 percent and 10 percent respectively 

also we experienced some specific positive growth drivers in 2011 such as new product introductions and product specific issues at competitors without these factors in 2012 our results were more reflective of market growth we estimate that industry procedure volumes were slightly positive on a global basis in 2012 while pricing was negative 

sales in 2012 were driven primarily by the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis and the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology fitmore hip stems and our continuum acetabular system trilogy it acetabular system and allofit it alloclassic acetabular system other leading products in our hips portfolio were the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem we also commercialized our vivacite ® highly crosslinked polyethylene liners in 2012 and expect this to drive sales growth in 2013 

extremities 

extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales reverse shoulder procedures continue to gain popularity as a solution for patients with rotator cuff damage 

dental 

dental sales declined by 4 percent in 2012 compared to an increase of 13 percent in 2011 while the americas sales increased in 2012 the overall performance of our dental franchise was impacted by several factors including softening in certain international markets and lower inventory levels maintained by our stocking distributors also americas sales growth was aided by the acquisition of a small brazilian dental 

 

  

   

company sales were led by the tapered screwvent implant system in addition sales of our recently released zimmer trabecular metal dental implant positively affected sales 2011 sales were buoyed by a change in a distribution arrangement under which we started capturing enduser sales as compared to the prior agreement where we only received a commission on enduser sales 

trauma 

trauma sales increased by 8 percent and 16 percent in 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the same prior year periods in 2011 we continued the launch of the zimmer natural nail system which contributed significantly to our trauma sales in 2011 and 2012 in addition to the zimmer natural nail system the zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales while sales of the zimmer universal locking system also made a strong contribution in 2012 

spine 

we experienced midsingle digit sales declines in spine each of the past two years this product category continues to face challenges related to utilization pricing pressure and payor approvals overall solid sales of the pathfinder nxt and sequoia pedicle screw systems our universal clamp tm spinal fixation system and trabecular metal technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system and other products 

surgical and other 

surgical and other delivered solid sales growth the past two years surgical and other sales were led by palacos bone cement and tourniquet products our wound debridement products powered instruments denovo nt natural tissue graft chondrofix osteochondral allograft and gelone crosslinked hyaluronate also made a positive contribution to sales results additionally our january 2012 acquisition of synvasive technology inc and october 2012 acquisition of dornoch medical systems inc provided growth in this product category

 cost of products sold 

gross margin was the same in 2012 compared to 2011 our foreign currency hedging program had a favorable impact to gross margin in 2012 under the program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings due to the strengthening of the us dollar in 2012 foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold were less in 2012 than they were in 2011 additionally lower inventory stepup charges from acquisitions were recognized in 2012 when compared to 2011 based on the timing of acquisitions this favorability was offset by the effect of lower prices on gross margin 

gross margin declined in 2011 from 2010 the most significant impact on gross margin in 2011 was from our foreign currency hedging program due to the weakening of the us dollar in 2011 we recognized foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold versus hedge gains in 2010 also in 2011 lower selling prices higher average costs per unit sold and higher inventory stepup charges all contributed to lower gross margins 

the following table reconciles the gross margin changes for 2012 and 2011 

 

 operating expenses 

rd expenses and rd as a percent of sales decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 after increases in 2011 when compared to 2010 in 2012 rd spending benefitted from the effect of our operational excellence initiatives as well as a natural decline related to certain large projects that achieved full commercialization including persona  the personalized knee system and the trabecular metal total ankle among other products the increase in 2011 was in line with our strategy to 

 

  

   

invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories as well as to increase spending on external research clinical regulatory and quality initiatives we expect rd spending in 2013 to be approximately 5 percent of sales for the year 

in 2012 sga decreased in dollars terms and as a percent of sales changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to 2011 lowered sga expense 

absent the effects of foreign currency exchange rates selling and distribution expenses were higher due to higher sales other unfavorable items included increased intangible amortization from business combinations higher employee recruiting and relocation costs increased legal costs and higher bad debt expense these were offset by favorable product liability claims lower instrument excess and obsolescence charges and lower advertising spend sga as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points compared to the prior year reflecting disciplined discretionary spending and the effect of our operational excellence initiatives which has lowered expenses such as salaries wages and benefits 

in 2011 sga increased in dollar terms but decreased as a percent of sales from 2010 the increase in dollars was primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions completed in december 2010 and higher bad debt expenses primarily from our europe operating segment these were partially offset by lower product liability charges recorded in sga related to the durom cup for more information regarding durom cup claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements sga as a percent of sales in 2011 decreased by 40 basis points from 2010 reflecting disciplined spending and the effect of our operational excellence initiatives 

“certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries provisions of 1578 million 750 million 350 million and 690 million were originally recorded during 2011 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively with an additional 150 million recorded during 2012 bringing the total provision to 3518 million for these claims excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sga the additional expense in 2012 was primarily for more estimated claims outside the us than were previously expected as well as higher estimated legal costs for more information regarding these claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2010 we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value as a result we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 960 million and 2040 million in 2012 and 2010 respectively for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

“special items” expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 1554 million 752 million and 347 million respectively 

“special items” in 2012 included significant expenses incurred for consulting and professional fees and dedicated project personnel for our operational excellence initiatives these initiatives are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions improving quality distribution sourcing manufacturing and our information technology systems other significant expenses in 2012 were from impairments from intangible assets acquired in business combinations settlement of various legal matters including royalty disputes and severance expenses related to various organizational changes as well as facility closures 

“special items” in 2011 resulted from a continued reduction in management layers and restructuring in certain areas resulting in 231 million of severance and terminationrelated expenses in 2011 we also incurred 260 million in consulting and professional fees associated with acquisitions and our operational excellence initiatives as a result of our acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives we also incurred asset impairments facility and employee relocation costs contract termination expenses and other costs 

“special items” in 2010 included expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure this resulted in 77 million of asset impairment charges and 67 million of employee severance and terminationrelated expenses in 2010 we also incurred consulting and professional fees facility and employee relocation costs contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from acquisitions “special items” also included the impairment of an availableforsale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

interest income interest expense income taxes and net earnings 

interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 550 million offering of senior notes we completed in november 2011 interest expense decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as the result of interest rate swap agreements we entered into in late 2010 and early 2011 to convert a portion of our fixedrate debt into variablerate debt interest income has increased the last two years due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments upon which interest income is being earned 

our effective tax rate etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 240 percent 224 percent and 306 percent respectively the variation of our etr has largely been affected by “certain claims” goodwill impairment charges and a 343 million benefit from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a 

 

  

   

legal entity restructuring “certain claims” expense favorably affects our etr because it lowers the income within our us operations relative to our foreign operations goodwill impairment charges negatively affect our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on such charges additionally in 2011 and 2010 our etr was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies these discrete items account for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 

our etr for 2013 will reflect certain tax benefits resulting from the enactment in january 2013 of us federal laws extending the rd credit and other tax benefits applicable to us the extension applies to both 2012 and 2013 and as a result of the timing of the law’s enactment the 2012 tax year benefits must be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 for financial reporting purposes as a result our 2013 financial results will reflect a reduction to our etr of approximately 03 percent related to the 2012 tax year benefits 

as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously net earnings in 2012 decreased 1 percent compared to 2011 in 2011 net earnings increased 27 percent compared to 2010 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 7 percent and 6 percent respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 while 2011 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 36 percent from 2010 the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup and other inventory charges “special items” “certain claims” goodwill impairment and the taxes on those items in addition to certain other tax adjustments we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 9325 million 9056 million and 8716 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 530 480 and 433 respectively 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes in millions except per share amounts

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 11519 million in 2012 compared to 11769 million in 2011 the principal source of cash from operating activities in 2012 was net earnings noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 4541 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows in 2012 were outflows of 551 million of cash the lower cash flows provided by operating activities in 2012 were primarily due to increased investments in inventory to support significant new product launches and increased product liability payments we paid approximately 90 million 60 million and 45 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively related to durom cup product liability claims we estimate the net remaining liability after insurance recovery for durom cup claims as of december 31 2012 is 1628 million we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next five years 

 

  

   

at december 31 2012 we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable which was the same as december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 we had 301 days of inventory on hand an increase of 24 days compared to december 31 2011 days of inventory on hand have increased due to significant new product launches 

cash flows used in investing activities were 5921 million in 2012 compared to 6244 million in 2011 additions to instruments and additions to other property plant and equipment did not change significantly yearoveryear in 2013 instrument additions are expected to be in a range of 125 to 145 million and property plant and equipment additions are expected to be in a range of 115 to 135 million we feel this level of capital spending is necessary to support new productrelated investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated debt securities the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities the timing of these investments can vary from year to year depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs acquired intellectual property rights relate to lumpsum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of prior contractual arrangements in the past three years we have made various business acquisitions including dornoch medical systems inc synvasive technology inc extraortho inc beijing montagne medical device co ltd sodem diffusion sa and certain foreignbased distributors 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4365 million for 2012 compared to 4558 million in 2011 in 2012 we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of 944 million and share repurchases of 4856 million in 2012 as it relates to our senior credit facility we converted some of the outstanding debt to a term loan and we borrowed 1000 million to repurchase shares as well as fund other corporate cash needs we plan to repay that 1000 million in the first quarter of 2013 in 2011 we issued senior unsecured notes in public offerings and used some of the proceeds to repurchase shares 

in 2012 we paid cash dividends quarterly starting in april at an annualized rate of 072 per share we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change in december 2012 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 018 per share that was paid in january 2013 

we have four tranches of senior notes outstanding 250 million aggregate principal amount of 14 percent notes due november 30 2014 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent notes due november 30 2019 300 million aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent notes due november 30 2021 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 percent notes due november 30 2039 interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity 

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

in may 2012 we entered into a new fiveyear 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior credit facility maturing may 9 2017 the senior credit facility replaced a previous credit facility with similar terms that was due to mature on november 30 2012 as of december 31 2012 we had 1000 million outstanding under the senior credit facility and an availability of 12500 million 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixedrate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales or transfers of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2012 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility and a utilization fee borrowings under the senior credit facility at december 31 2012 are us dollarbased 

borrowings of 117 billion japanese yen outstanding under the previous credit facility were converted to the senior credit facility on may 24 2012 we refinanced these borrowings by entering into a separate term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for 117 billion japanese yen and we repaid the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility 

the term loan will mature on may 31 2016 borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 061 percent per annum until maturity 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 791 million 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

 

  

   

as of december 31 2012 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 9157 million these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer all of these debt securities remain highlyrated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 

as of december 31 2012 10631 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations repatriation of these assets to the us may have tax consequences 8298 million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

we may use excess cash to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2012 10146 million remained authorized under a 15 billion repurchase program which will expire on december 31 2014 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 481 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31 2012 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2013 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our 

plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these unrecognized tax benefits 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 54 million 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the 

 

  

   

benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 4032 million related to the durom cup including 150 million in 2012 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate 

the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 

as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of 960 million in 2012 in 2010 we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of 2040 million see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment 

we have six other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year’s income approach for each of those six reporting units the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value 

sharebased payment – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2013 through june 2015 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2012 were 15488 million the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2012 were 3039 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2012 were eurousd 133 swiss 

francusd 108 usdjapanese yen 7827 british poundusd 158 usdcanadian dollar 101 australian dollarusd 096 usdkorean won 1169 usdswedish krona 685 usdczech koruna 1866 usdthai baht 3209 usdtaiwan dollar 2901 usdsouth african rand 872 usdrussian ruble 3342 and usdindian ruppee 5458 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june 2016 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

 

  

   

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of 24945 million at december 31 2012 primarily in euros and japanese yen 13209 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2012 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents presently all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at shortterm variable rates 

in 2010 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of 250 million that hedge a portion of our 500 million 4625 percent senior notes due november 30 2019 on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december 31 2012 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and we pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points 

the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2012 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints 

 

  

   

the ongoing financial crisis in the euro zone continues to impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals we have experienced an increasing number of days sales outstanding in some european countries compared to levels in 2010 as of december 31 2012 in greece italy portugal and spain countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our gross shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable combined were 2092 million with allowances for doubtful accounts of 78 million recorded in those countries the net balance was 2014 million representing 24 percent of our total consolidated shortterm and longterm trade accounts receivable balance net italy and spain account for 1916 million of that net amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries we maintain contact with these customers on a regular basis we 

continue to receive payments albeit at a slower rate than in the past we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay as evidence of this in spain we received significant payments in july 2012 to settle certain past due accounts receivable to the extent these governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 

 

  

   

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of zimmer holdings inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  

based on that assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2012 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 as stated in its report which appears in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

we are broadening our product offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent 2386 million 2185 million and 2057 million respectively on research and development our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2011 we employed more than 1000 research and development employees worldwide 

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

 

  

   

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us 

other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses 

all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of certain preamendment devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices and to seek criminal prosecution of executives for violation of fda regulations there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and 

certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa our global operations are also subject to foreign anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act among others as part of our global compliance program we seek to address anticorruption risks proactively 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

we continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 by the us federal government will have on our business the new law includes a 23 percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc synthes inc and tornier inc 

in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc 

 

  

   

smith  nephew plc and biomet inc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag a subsidiary of b braun waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us many hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc and nuvasive inc 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag dentsply international and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet inc 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture our products at twelve sites including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon ireland etupes france beijing and xianning china and geneva switzerland we also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality lead time reduction and capacity optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products and processes and negotiated cost reductions from thirdparty suppliers 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 5000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2011 we employed more than 8700 employees worldwide including more than 1000 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 4700 employees are located within the us and approximately 4000 employees are located outside of the us primarily throughout europe and in japan we have approximately 3600 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs more than 1400 employees approximately 150 us employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

we have a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2012

 item 1a   risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or 

uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement we entered into in september 2007 we may be subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

as previously reported in september 2007 we settled an investigation conducted by the us attorney’s office for the district of new jersey us attorney into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons as part of that settlement we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services oighhs a copy of the cia is filed as an exhibit to this report if we do not comply with the terms of the cia we could be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare 

the ongoing investigation by the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice regarding potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows 

we are cooperating fully with the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice with regard to an ongoing investigation of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we train our employees distributors and others concerning these issues we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not occur if we are found to have violated the foreign corrupt practices act we may face sanctions including fines criminal penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses 

in july 2011 we received form fda483 inspectional observations from the fda concerning quality systems at our warsaw indiana manufacturing facility and we may not be able to timely and adequately address the quality system issues raised by the fda 

following a july 2011 routine inspection of our warsaw indiana manufacturing facility the fda issued a form 483 notice the form 483 notice identified certain inspectional observations regarding the facility’s quality systems the facility manufactures reconstructive products that are sold globally we have responded in writing to the observations and met with representatives of the district office of the fda to discuss our response and action plans we expect the fda to conduct a reinspection of this facility in the future to determine whether we have taken sufficient actions to address the observations described in the form 483 notice if the fda 

 

  

   

is not satisfied with our response to the issues identified in the form 483 notice the fda could take additional actions such as issuing a warning letter to us which among other things could adversely affect our ability to receive approvals of regulatory applications until the issues are resolved any of these possible sanctions could have an adverse impact on our revenues financial position results of operations and cash flows and otherwise harm our business and reputation 

challenging global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2011 growth in the healthcare industry and our revenue growth were adversely affected by continuing challenges in the global economy although the us economy is recovering from the worst recession in decades unemployment remains high and consumer confidence remains low resulting in reduced numbers of insured patients and the deferral of elective reconstructive procedures global economic conditions particularly in europe our secondlargest operating segment remain uncertain we believe that european austerity measures implemented to address the ongoing financial crisis contributed to decreased healthcare utilization and increased pricing pressure for some of our products we cannot assure you that challenges in the global economy will not continue to negatively impact procedure volumes average selling prices and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payors any of which could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we have experienced delays in the collection of receivables from hospitals in certain countries that have national healthcare systems including certain regions in spain italy greece and portugal which are the countries most directly affected by the euro zone crisis repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries continuing high unemployment in the us a worsening of the european financial crisis or a failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our european receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

       without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

      in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived more than 45 percent of our net sales in 2011 from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

         

 

  

   

    violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

the us patent and trademark office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents future changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 

pending and future intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and 

profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues if we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights such loss could result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products 

pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as previously reported we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our durom ® acetabular component  durom cup in the us in july 2008 subsequently a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted against us we have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending additional claims may be asserted in the future we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit can be costly to defend product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage we have substantial selfinsured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement furthermore even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s 

 

  

   

view of these matters may change in the future given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following 

    

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

in may 2011 the irs concluded its examinations of our us federal returns for years 2005 through 2007 and issued income tax assessments reallocating profits between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we believe that we have followed applicable us tax laws and will vigorously defend our income tax positions however the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material impact on our income tax expense results of operations and cash flows for future periods 

us healthcare reform legislation includes provisions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as the 2010 us healthcare law continues to be phased in we believe the law will have an impact on various aspects of our business operations the 2013 imposition of the 23 percent medical device excise tax is forcing us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the increased expense that we will incur because of the tax we do not 

 

  

   

expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement per the healthcare law nor do we expect to be able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population the level of difficulty in terms of complying with the medical device tax will depend on the regulations put forth by the us department of treasury in addition the law’s medicare payment reforms such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments will provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products accordingly while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the ultimate impact of the law on our business ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

     in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

     any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

 

  

   

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

in addition if we fail to comply with applicable material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations we may be subject to a range of sanctions including 

        

moreover the fda recently issued several guidance documents that may impact the amount of data required for 510k clearance of new products the guidance documents may also require additional submissions for minor changes to products currently on the market where none were required in the past additionally reauthorization of the medical device user fee act to be completed by september 30 2012 may lead to additional postmarket requirements for certain 510k products we expect these 510krelated changes could delay new products from reaching the market in the us and increase the costs of introducing new products and features which could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

 item 7   management’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation 

overview 

 

we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2011 

demand volume and mix trends 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of 2011 sales growth which is 1 percentage point above the rate of growth from 2010 compared to 2009 

volume and mix trends continued to be challenged by the global economy we believe reconstructive procedure volumes in 2011 continued to be lower than historical utilization rates and lower than demographic trends would indicate this effect was particularly pronounced in our americas operating segment where the impact of ongoing high unemployment and low consumer confidence contributed to softness 

longterm indicators still point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population obesity more active lifestyles growth in emerging markets new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and proven clinical benefits of joint replacement procedures in addition the ongoing shift in demand to premium products such as prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene trabecular metal technology products hip stems with kinectiv technology highflex knees porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 

pricing trends 

global average selling prices declined by 1 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 selling prices in the americas europe and asia pacific declined by 2 percent were flat and declined by 1 percent respectively during 2011 we continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems due to these pressures and a biannual price adjustment in japan in april 2012 we expect selling prices will have approximately a negative 2 percent effect on sales on a global basis in 2012 

foreign currency exchange rates 

for 2011 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent increase in sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2011 year end rates we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2012 of approximately 1 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

global economic conditions 

we believe adverse conditions in the global economy continue to negatively affect elective hospital procedures however we continue to believe that procedure deferrals will diminish slowly over time and that growth rates will trend higher as they track more in line with historical usage rates among the aging population we believe these demographic trends will ultimately foster longterm sustained growth even if in the shortterm the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected 

2012 outlook 

we estimate our sales will grow between 1 and 3 percent in 2012 such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment as discussed previously we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of 2 percent and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately 1 percent based upon december 31 2011 rates 

assuming currency rates remain at december 31 2011 levels we expect our gross margin to be between 74 and 75 percent of sales in 2012 this takes into account the cost pressures we have experienced from lower than planned manufacturing volumes as well as anticipated losses from foreign currency hedges however if currency rates remain at december 31 2011 levels the hedge losses we recognize in 2012 will be less than the hedge losses recognized in 2011 we expect to continue making investments in research and development rd in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percent of sales is expected to be between 395 and 405 percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and further leverage revenue growth 

we expect to incur approximately 100 million of expenses in 2012 related to certain restructuring and transformation initiatives the programs are targeted at streamlining the organization and business processes they 

 

  

   

are expected to be mostly completed in 2012 we also expect to incur approximately 10 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions we expect to recognize the majority of these 110 million of expenses in “special items” on our statement of net earnings the gross margin and sga percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 

assuming variable rates remain at december 31 2011 levels we expect interest income and expense net to be approximately 65 million in 2012 which is higher than 2011 primarily due to a 550 million offering of senior notes completed in november 2011

 the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

   

   

knees 

knee sales experienced 2 percent growth in each of the past two years including double digit growth in europe and asia pacific in 2011 offset by a decline in sales in the americas we estimate that industry procedure volumes were flat to slightly positive on a global basis in 2011 while pricing was negative we believe procedure volumes will continue to be pressured from a cyclical downturn related to uncertain global economic conditions 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee and the nexgen crflex knee together with the gender solutions naturalknee flex system led knee sales in addition sales of the gender solutions patello femoral joint and zimmer patient specific instruments exhibited growth 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 by positive 4 percent and negative 2 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 by 9 percent and 10 percent respectively 

hips 

hip sales grew by 7 percent in 2011 driven by new product introductions such as our continuum acetabular system and our zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology additionally negative publicity in the marketplace over the use of hip systems that use metalonmetal technology may have contributed to an increase in sales of hip systems with alternative bearing surfaces metalonmetal technology represents only a small portion of our hip sales therefore our market share position may have benefited from customers using our hip systems instead of a competitor’s metalonmetal system 

the zimmer ml taper stem the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem led hip stem sales in addition sales of the continuum acetabular system trilogy it acetabular system and allofit it alloclassic acetabular system and the trabecular metal revision shell and augment cups were strong when compared to the prior year periods as were sales of biolox delta heads and fitmore hip stems 

in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 by positive 6 percent and negative 2 percent respectively in asia pacific our december 2010 acquisition of beijing montagne medical device co ltd made a contribution to that operating segment’s sales growth in 2011 additionally in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 by 10 percent and 8 percent respectively 

extremities 

extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years led by the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system and the biglianiflatow complete shoulder solution trabecular metal technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market we continue to see competitive pressure in this category but expect that new product and instrument introductions will help to accelerate growth 

dental 

dental experienced sales growth of 13 percent in 2011 compared to 7 percent growth in 2010 including a 7 percent increase in 2011 due to pricing a significant portion of this pricing increase was due to a change in the agreement that started in the fourth quarter of 2010 by which we distribute certain regenerative products under the prior agreement we did not take title to the products and only received a commission from the enduser sale under the new agreement we take title to the product and recognize the final enduser sale along with the cost of products sold and any other sellingrelated costs sales were led by the tapered screwvent implant system 

trauma 

trauma sales increased by 16 percent in 2011 after experiencing 5 percent sales growth in 2010 in 2011 we continued the launch of the zimmer natural nail system which contributed significantly to our trauma sales in addition to the zimmer natural nail system zimmer periarticular locking plates and the zimmer ncb plating system led trauma sales while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution 

spine 

we experienced mid to high single digit sales declines in spine each of the past two years the sales declines have come from our americas segment as both europe and asia pacific have experienced sales growth in each of the past two years in the americas segment we have experienced operational challenges with our sales force a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in sales of our dynesys dynamic stabilization system overall solid sales of the pathfinder and sequoia pedicle screw systems our universal clamp system and trabecular metal technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system 

surgical and other 

surgical and other delivered solid sales growth the past two years surgical and other sales were led by palacos bone cement and tourniquet products our wound debridement products also made a strong contribution to sales results as did our december 2010 acquisition of sodem diffusion sa

 cost of products sold 

gross margin declined in 2011 after minimal change from 2009 to 2010 the most significant impact on gross margin in 2011 was from our foreign currency hedging program under the program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings due to the weakening of the us dollar in 2011 we recognized foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold versus hedge gains in 2010 

also in 2011 lower selling prices higher average costs per unit sold and higher inventory stepup charges all contributed to lower gross margins in 2010 lower average selling prices higher average costs per unit sold and the impact of our hedging program also negatively affected gross margin but were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges from improved inventory management and certain productspecific matters that were experienced in 2009 which did not recur in 2010 

the following table reconciles the gross margin changes for 2011 and 2010 

 

 operating expenses 

rd expense and rd expense as a percent of sales increased in each of the last two years these increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories as well as to increase spending on external research clinical regulatory and quality initiatives we continue to expect rd spending to be between 5 to 6 percent of sales in 2012 

sga has increased in dollars terms over the last three years but has decreased as a percent of sales 

in 2011 sga increased in dollar terms from 2010 primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions completed in december 2010 and higher bad debt expenses primarily from our europe operating segment these were partially offset by lower product liability charges recorded in sga related to the durom cup for more information regarding durom cup claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements sga as a percent of sales decreased by 40 basis points from 2010 reflecting disciplined spending and the effect of our transformation initiatives which has lowered expenses such as salaries wages and benefits 

in 2010 sga increased in dollar terms from 2009 primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales and from increased spending to fund medical education programs sga as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 60 basis points from 2009 reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales and no expense in 2010 related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of 2009 

“certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries provisions of 750 million 350 million and 690 million were originally recorded during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively with an additional 1578 million recorded during 2011 bringing the total provision to 3368 million for these claims excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sga for more information regarding these claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated 

 

  

   

fair value as a result we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2040 million and 730 million during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

we recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of 321 million during 2009 related to amending our us and puerto rico postretirement benefit plans for more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

“special items” expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 752 million 347 million and 753 million respectively in 2011 we continued reducing management layers and restructured certain areas resulting in 231 million of severance and terminationrelated expenses in 2011 we also incurred 260 million in consulting and professional fees associated with acquisitions and our business transformation initiatives as a result of our acquisitions and transformation initiatives we also incurred asset impairments facility and employee relocation costs contract termination expenses and other costs 

“special items” in 2010 included expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure this resulted in 77 million of asset impairment charges and 67 million of employee severance and terminationrelated expenses in 2010 we also incurred consulting and professional fees facility and employee relocation costs contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from acquisitions “special items” also included the impairment of an availableforsale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 

“special items” in 2009 included a workforce realignment which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support longterm growth as a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions we incurred approximately 190 million of severance and terminationrelated expenses other “special items” in 2009 included approximately 94 million of expenses related to contract termination costs 234 million related to certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs related to acquisitions 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

interest income interest expense income taxes and net earnings 

interest expense decreased in 2011 after a significant increase in 2010 from 2009 in november 2009 we issued 10 billion of senior unsecured notes which was the primary cause of the increase in 2010 the decrease in interest expense in 2011 is the result of interest rate swap agreements we entered into in late 2010 and early 2011 to convert a portion of our fixedrate debt into variablerate debt interest income has increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments and higher returns on certain investments 

our effective tax rate etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 224 percent 306 percent and 281 percent respectively the variation of our etr has largely been affected by “certain claims” and goodwill impairment charges “certain claims” expense favorably affects our etr because it lowers the income within our us operations relative to our foreign operations goodwill impairment charges negatively affect our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on such charges additionally in 2011 and 2010 our etr was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies these discrete items account for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 

as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously net earnings in 2011 increased 27 percent compared to 2010 in 2010 net earnings decreased 17 percent compared to 2009 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 36 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 while 2010 basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent from 2009 the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases 

nongaap operating performance measures 

we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup charges “special items” “certain claims” net curtailment and settlement and goodwill impairment and the taxes on those items in addition to certain other tax adjustments we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 9056 million 8716 million and 8499 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 480 433 and 394 respectively 

 

  

   

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes 

 

  

  

 the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates for the jurisdictions where the items were incurred 

healthcare reform in the us 

we continue to assess the impact that federal healthcare reform will have on our business federal healthcare reform includes a 23 percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 11769 million in 2011 compared to 11935 million in 2010 the principal source of cash from operating activities in 2011 was net earnings noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 4121 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows in 2011 provided 48 million of cash the lower cash flows provided by operating activities in the 2011 period were primarily due to lower receivable collections and increased product liability payments we paid approximately 60 million 45 million and 25 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively related to durom cup product liability claims we estimate the net remaining liability after insurance recovery for durom cup claims as of december 31 2011 is 2348 million we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next five years 

at december 31 2011 we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable an increase of 6 days 

when compared to december 31 2010 reflecting changes in certain accounts receivable factoring programs and the economic environment in our europe operating segment at december 31 2011 we had 277 days of inventory on hand a decrease of 30 days compared to december 31 2010 days of inventory on hand have decreased due to higher cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales most notably from foreign currency hedge losses and a reduction in us consignment inventory that was achieved through new inventory management strategies 

cash flows used in investing activities were 6244 million in 2011 compared to 7269 million in 2010 additions to instruments decreased in 2011 compared to the 2010 period because the 2010 period included investments in new product launches such as our continuum acetabular system and included instrumentation in our knee product category such as posterior referencing instrumentation spending on other property plant and equipment increased in 2011 compared to the 2010 period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in 2010 during 2012 for both instruments and property plant and equipment we expect to purchase approximately 120 to 140 million we feel this level of capital spending is necessary to support new productrelated investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment beginning in 2009 and with more significance thereafter we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated debt securities the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities acquired intellectual property rights relate to lumpsum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements in the past three years we have made various business acquisitions including extraortho inc beijing montagne medical device co ltd sodem diffusion sa and certain foreignbased distributors 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4558 million for 2011 compared to 4896 million in 2010 in 2011 and 2009 we issued senior unsecured notes in public offerings we used some of the proceeds to repurchase our common stock and to repay outstanding debt on our revolving credit facilities 

in december 2011 our board of directors declared a dividend of 018 per share to be paid in april 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 30 2012 based upon shares outstanding as of december 31 2011 we would pay 321 million we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

we have four tranches of senior notes outstanding 250 million aggregate principal amount of 14 percent notes due november 30 2014 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent notes due november 30 2019 300 million aggregate principal amount of 3375 percent notes due november 30 2021 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 percent notes due november 30 2039 interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity 

 

  

   

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing november 30 2012 senior credit facility we had 1430 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2011 and an availability of 12070 million we intend to secure another senior credit facility in 2012 before our current senior credit facility matures 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 636 million 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

as of december 31 2011 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 6727 million these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer all of these debt securities remain highlyrated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 

as of december 31 2011 11319 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences approximately 9700 million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 

we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2011 we had authority to repurchase up to 15 billion shares of common stock through december 31 2014 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 482 million of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2012 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these unrecognized tax benefits 

we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 72 million 

 

  

   

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

excess inventory and instruments – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply accordingly inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value to determine the appropriate net realizable value we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

income taxes – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not 

previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

commitments and contingencies – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded provisions totaling 3882 million related to the durom cup including 1620 million in 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 

goodwill and intangible assets – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 

as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of 2040 million during the year ended december 31 2010 in the year ended december 31 2009 we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of 730 million see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges 

in our annual impairment testing in 2011 we employed a similar methodology of using income and market approaches to estimate fair value for the us spine reporting unit the 2011 impairment test concluded that goodwill was not impaired however since goodwill had been written down to its implied fair value of 1370 million in the prior year the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was only 13 percent greater than its carrying value therefore minor changes to the estimated 

 

  

   

discounted cash flows or market conditions may cause us to recognize further impairment charges in the future 

we have six other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year’s income approach for each of those six reporting units the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying value 

as of december 31 2011 we had intangible assets of 2058 million related to trademarks and trade names of which 1923 million are classified as having an indefinite life we currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names while it is anticipated it is not certain that these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names if these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names these assets may be impaired andor their useful lives may need adjusted 

sharebased payment – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2012 through june 2014 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2011 were 13 billion the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2011 were 2467 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2010 were eurousd 136 swiss francusd 091 usdjapanese yen 8118 british poundusd 158 usdcanadian dollar 102 australian dollarusd 091 

usdkorean won 1159 usdswedish krona 689 usdczech koruna 1832 usdthai baht 3154 usdtaiwan dollar 2921 usdsouth african rand 812 usdrussian ruble 3201 and usdindian ruppee 4898 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2013 depending on the direction of the change by the following average approximate amounts in millions 

 

 any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of 24047 million at december 31 2011 primarily in euros and japanese yen 13143 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2011 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

  

 

  

   

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents presently all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at shortterm rates 

in 2010 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of 250 million that hedge a portion of our 500 million 4625 percent senior notes due november 30 2019 on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december 31 2011 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and we pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points 

the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap changes in the fair value of the 

derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

in 2011 we entered into multiple crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 11798 million japanese yen to hedge us dollar debt borrowed by our japan subsidiary we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks the effective portion of changes in fair value of the crosscurrency interest rate swaps is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in interest expense when the hedged item affects net earnings on the crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december 31 2011 we pay a fixed interest rate of 01 percent and receive variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus 185 basis points 

the crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with remeasuring the debt to japanese yen and the interest rate risk associated with the variablerate debt we entered into these instruments in order to take advantage of a market situation where we could lockin interest at a very low fixedrate on debt 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2011 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions or highlyrated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the 

 

  

   

us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables 

repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems most notably in europe healthcare is sponsored by the government because we sell products to public hospitals in those countries we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints we continue to monitor the financial crisis in the euro zone and the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals in countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk our accounts 

receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts in greece italy portugal and spain total 2311 million or 28 of our total accounts receivable balance net with italy and spain accounting for 2179 million of that amount we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries and to the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 

while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 

 

  

   

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

orthopaedic reconstructive implants 

 

  

 

total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articular surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime or primary joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining cr designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized ps and ultracongruent uc designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis 

 

our portfolio of minimally invasive solutions tm procedures mis includes the mis miniincision total knee procedure the mis miniincision procedure utilizes specialized mis instruments which feature smaller ergonomic and highly precise instruments which accommodate and facilitate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues 

 

we offer a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including the following

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and consider acquiring complementary products or businesses or establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

 

most of our new products fall into an fda classification that requires the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the us other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses all of our devices marketed in the us have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of certain preamendment devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices and to seek criminal prosecution of executives for violation of fda regulations there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain 

 

 

 

 authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as part of our global compliance program we seek to address fcpa risks proactively 

 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

 

we continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 by the us federal government will have on our business the new law includes a 23 percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013 

 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc synthes inc and tornier inc 

 

in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc smith  nephew plc and biomet inc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag a subsidiary of b braun waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market although global products are gaining acceptance we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc and nuvasive inc 

 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag astra tech dental dentsply international and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture substantially all of our products at nine sites including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon ireland and etupes france additionally in december 2010 we acquired two businesses beijing montagne medical device co ltd montagne and sodem diffusion sa sodem montagne has manufacturing facilities in beijing and xianning china and sodem has manufacturing facilities in geneva switzerland we expect these facilities will become an important part of our manufacturing network

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at levels up to 90 percent of total capacity we continually 

 

 

 

 evaluate the potential to insource products currently purchased from outside vendors to onsite production 

 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products such as castings and forgings and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 

 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 5000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products

our marketing success in the us and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

  

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

  

moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the us which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more than 40 percent of our net sales from outside the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally including in emerging markets which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations 

 

 

 

 are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan the us dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

 

the us patent and trademark office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents future changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 

 

we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues if we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights we may be unable to manufacture sell or use some of our products 

 

we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

 

in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients as previously reported we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our durom ® acetabular component  durom cup in the us in july 2008 following our action product liability lawsuits and other claims were asserted against us and additional similar claims may be asserted product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies typically have substantial retentions or deductibles for which we are responsible product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

 

  

we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

 

in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 

 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following 

  

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

 

future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results 

 

our assets include intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline we could be required under current us accounting rules to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment any writeoff of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

 

in january 2011 the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment nopa for tax years 2006 and 2007 the nopa relates to intercompany pricing between certain of our us and foreign subsidiaries we believe that we have followed applicable us tax laws and will vigorously defend our income tax positions however the ultimate settlement with the irs related to these proposed adjustments could have a material impact on our income tax expense and net earnings 

 

the impact of us healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain 

 

in march 2010 federal legislation to reform the us healthcare system was enacted into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage improve quality and reduce costs over time we expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations for example to the extent that the number of uninsured or underinsured patients is reduced demand for our products in the us could marginally increase however it is unclear how the new law will impact patient access to new technologies or reimbursement rates under the medicare program in addition the new law imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices scheduled to be implemented in 2013 that will apply to us sales of a majority of our medical device products 

 

many of the details of the new law will be included in new and revised regulations which have not yet been promulgated and require additional guidance and specificity to be provided 

 

 

 

 by the department of health and human services department of labor and department of the treasury accordingly while it is too early to understand and predict the ultimate impact of the new law on our business the legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the us exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

  

in markets outside of the us other factors influence competition as well including 

  

our competitors may 

  

any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely 

 

 

 

 basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

 

in addition if we fail to comply with applicable material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations we may be subject to a range of sanctions including 

  

moreover the fda recently announced wideranging proposals to reform the 510k process while it is not known which reforms may ultimately be implemented they may result in more extensive data requirements and a longer process for obtaining clearance we expect 510k reform could delay new products from reaching the market in the us and increase the costs of introducing new products and features which could adversely affect our business 

 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business could be harmed

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation 

 

overview 

 

we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

demand volume and mix trends 

 

 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 3 percentage points of 2010 sales growth which is 1 percentage point above the rate of growth from 2009 compared to 2008 

 

we believe longterm indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population growth in emerging markets obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the ongoing shift in demand to premium products such as longevity and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products hip stems with kinectiv technology highflex knees knee revision products porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 

 

pricing trends 

 

 

global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2010 selling prices in the americas europe and asia pacific decreased 1 percent were flat and decreased 2 percent respectively during 2010 we continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems in the americas we have experienced compression of historic pricing differentials amongst our customers asia pacific was especially influenced by a biannual pricing adjustment in japan that went into effect on april 1 2010 due to these pressures we expect selling prices will continue to have a negative 1 to 2 percent effect on sales on a global basis in 2011 

 

foreign currency exchange rates 

 

 

for 2010 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent increase in sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2010 year end rates we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2011 of approximately 1 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

 

global economic conditions 

 

 

we believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have negatively affected elective hospital procedures in the fourth quarter of 2010 we saw some stabilization in procedure volumes and we believe the number of procedures will increase as the global economy strengthens despite the current conditions of the global economy it is well known that demographic trends will expand the patient base that needs our products we believe these factors will ultimately foster longterm sustained growth even if in the shortterm the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected 

 

2011 outlook 

 

 

we estimate our sales will grow between 3 and 5 percent in 2011 such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment as discussed previously we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth by 1 to 2 percent and foreign currency exchange rates to have a positive effect on sales growth by approximately 1 percent based upon december 31 2010 rates 

 

assuming currency rates remain at december 31 2010 rates we expect our gross margin to be approximately 75 percent of sales in 2011 this takes into account anticipated losses from foreign currency hedge losses resulting from relative weakness in the us dollar we expect to continue making investments in research and development rd in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percent of sales is expected to be between 40 and 41 percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and leverage revenue growth 

 

we expect to incur 75 to 80 million of expenses in 2011 related to certain global restructuring and transformation initiatives we also expect to incur an additional 15 to 20 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions we anticipate recognizing some of the 90 to 100 million in cost of products sold and the majority in “special items” on our statement of net earnings the gross margin and sga percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 

 

we expect interest and other expense to be approximately 50 million in 2011 which is slightly lower than 2010 as we have entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert a portion of our 1 billion senior notes from fixedrate debt to variablerate debt

the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

 

 

  

 

knee sales have experienced flat to moderate growth over the past two years our knee sales have been affected by broader economic conditions impacting volumemix and competitive pressures from newer knee systems that have more modern surgical instruments for implantation we intend to counter these competitive pressures in 2011 and thereafter as we continue to launch our new patient specific and posterior referencing instrumentation systems as well as through new product development 

 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee and the nexgen crflex knee together with the gender solutions naturalknee flex system led knee sales in addition sales of partial knee devices including the zimmer unicompartmental knee and the recently released gender solutions patellofemoral joint exhibited growth in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected knee sales in the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 by 2 percent and 6 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales in the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 by 10 percent and zero percent respectively 

 

  

 

hip sales rebounded from negative growth in 2009 to positive growth in 2010 driven by new product introductions such as our continuum acetabular system and our zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology 

 

the zimmer ml taper stem the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem led hip stem sales in addition sales of revision hip products such as the zmr hip system and the trabecular metal revision shell and augment cups were strong when compared to the prior year periods as were sales of fitmore hip stems in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected hip sales in the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 by 2 percent and 6 percent respectively in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 by 8 percent and 4 percent respectively 

 

  

 

extremities sales have grown by low double digits the past two years led by the biglianiflatow complete shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system trabecular metal technology is playing a critical role 

 

 

 

 in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market 

 

  

 

dental sales have experienced a significant turnaround from a negative 10 percent decline in 2009 to positive 7 percent growth in 2010 in 2009 our dental sales were affected more by the global economic environment than our other product categories as many dental procedures are not reimbursed by thirdparty payors sales were led by the tapered screwvent implant system additionally regenerative products have exhibited strong sales growth in 2010 

 

  

 

trauma sales increased in the mid single digits the past two years zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst ® intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution in 2009 we initiated the launch of the zimmer natural nail system which made a strong contribution to 2010 sales we anticipate that a broader launch of that system will continue to positively affect sales growth 

 

  

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we acquired abbott spine as a result of the acquisition spine sales increased in 2009 but underlying that performance were sales losses associated with integration of the business in 2010 once we anniversaried out of the additional sales from the acquisition we experienced sales declines most notably in our americas segment in addition to the operational challenges associated with the integration of the abbott spine business in the americas a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in our dynesys dynamic stabilization system have affected sales in contrast to the americas our spine sales grew in europe and asia pacific in 2010 driven by the stabilization of our distribution channels which followed the abbott spine integration activity of 2009 overall solid sales of the pathfinder and sequoia pedicle screw systems our universal clamp system and our trinica anterior cervical plate system partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system 

 

  

 

surgical and other sales went from 1 percent sales growth in 2009 to 13 percent sales growth in 2010 in 2008 we voluntarily recalled and suspended production of certain patient care products and were able to reintroduce those products during the year in 2009 accordingly 2009 sales were suppressed especially in the first half of the year but we started to regain market share in the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010 surgical sales were led by palacos bone cement wound debridement products tourniquet products and powered instruments 

 

the following table presents estimated 2010 global market size and market share information dollars in billions 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

gross margin in total has not changed significantly over the past three years for various offsetting reasons in the last half of 2009 and early 2010 lower production levels caused our manufacturing costs per unit to be higher resulting in increased costs in both 2010 and 2009 in 2010 the higher unit costs were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges resulting from improved inventory management and certain productspecific matters that were experienced in 2009 which did not recur in 2010 

 

foreign currency hedging also affects our gross margin under our hedging program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings in 2010 and 2009 we recognized hedge gains in cost of products sold with 2010 gains being less than 2009 gains in 2008 we recognized foreign currency hedge losses 

 

 

 

  

the following table reconciles the gross margin changes for 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

  

 

rd expense and rd as a percent of sales has increased in each of the last two years these increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories as well as to increase spending on external research clinical regulatory and quality initiatives additionally in 2008 we experienced some delay in rd activities as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program we continue to expect rd spending to be between 5 to 6 percent of sales in 2011 

 

sga has increased in dollars terms over the last three years but as a percent of sales was lower in 2010 and 2008 compared to 2009 

 

in 2010 sga increased in dollar terms from 2009 primarily for variable selling and distribution expenses as 2010 sales were higher than 2009 sales and from increased spending to fund medical education programs sga as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 60 basis points from 2009 reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales and no expense in 2010 related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of 2009 

 

in 2009 sga as a percent of sales increased approximately 90 basis points compared to 2008 sga expense in the 2008 period included approximately 60 million of incremental costs such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global rollout of enhancements to our compliance program the savings from these costs in 2009 were offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs abbott spine costs and increased product liability claims the acquisition of abbott spine increased sga costs for items such as selling expenses increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets additionally sga as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates a majority of our sga spend is incurred in the us primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as dental trauma spine and surgical therefore sga expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue which caused sga as a percentage of net sales to increase in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

“certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries provisions of 350 million and 690 million were originally recorded during 2009 and 2008 respectively with an additional 750 million recorded during 2010 bringing the total provision to 1790 million for these claims for more information regarding these claims see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 we noted that the carrying values of the assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value as a result we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2040 million and 730 million during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimate the fair values of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit for each of those five other reporting units the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value 

 

we recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of 321 million during 2009 related to amending our us and puerto rico postretirement benefit plans for more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

“special items” expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 347 million 753 million and 685 million respectively 2010 includes expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure this resulted in 77 million of asset impairment charges and 67 million of employee severance and terminationrelated expenses we have also incurred consulting and professional fees facility and employee relocation costs contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from our acquisitions of abbott spine beijing montagne medical device co ltd and third party distributors “special items” also includes the impairment of an availableforsale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 

 

“special items” in 2009 included a workforce realignment which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support longterm growth as a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions we incurred approximately 190 million of severance and terminationrelated expenses other “special items” in 2009 included approximately 94 million of expenses related to contract termination costs 234 million of certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs incurred to integrate the abbott spine business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

included in “special items” in 2008 was 385 million of inprocess research and development related to the abbott spine acquisition and other costs related to the integration of abbott spine 

 

 

 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “special items” charges 

 

  

 

interest and other expense has increased over the past three years interest and other expense increased in 2010 over 2009 due to the 10 billion senior unsecured notes that we issued in november 2009 as a result in 2010 we had a full year of interest on these notes interest and other expense in 2009 increased over 2008 as the result of longterm debt incurred to partially fund the abbott spine acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of the senior unsecured notes in november 2009 interest and other income in 2008 included a realized gain of 388 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 has been 306 percent 281 percent and 243 percent respectively the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 are negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of 2040 million and 730 million respectively for which no tax benefit was recorded the goodwill impairment charges have increased the effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 by approximately 6 percent and 2 percent respectively additionally in 2010 the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies the effective tax rate for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit of 317 million related to a 2007 us government civil settlement expense resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent in the 2008 effective tax rate this impact on the 2008 effective tax rate was partially offset by abbott spine acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded these discrete items account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rates in the past three years 

 

as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously net earnings in 2010 decreased 17 percent compared to 2009 in 2009 net earnings decreased 15 percent compared to 2008 basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 while 2009 basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 10 percent and 11 percent respectively from 2008 the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases made in the last three years 

 

  

 

we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory stepup charges “special items” “certain claims” net curtailment and settlement and goodwill impairment and the taxes on those items and the tax benefit related to a 2007 civil settlement we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons of our ongoing operating results it helps to better identify operating trends and perform trend analysis that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items certain of these nongaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 

 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 8716 million 8499 million and 9243 million respectively and our nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were 433 394 and 405 respectively 

 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased sales disciplined spending in sga and the absence of monitorrelated expenses in 2010 such increases to nongaap adjusted net earnings were slightly offset by increased rd and medical education expenses and increased interest expense from the senior unsecured notes issued in 2009 

 

our nongaap adjusted net earnings decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 as lower sales and higher rd and medical education expenses reduced nongaap adjusted net earnings additionally 2008 nongaap adjusted net earnings featured a 388 million pretax gain related to sales of certain marketable securities the 2009 period did contain some expense savings such as the 60 million of incremental savings related to monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global rollout of enhancements to our compliance program but such savings were not enough to offset the other items that reduced nongaap adjusted net earnings 

 

the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our nongaap adjusted net earnings and nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

  

 

we continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 by the us federal government will have on our business the new law includes a 23 percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 11935 million in 2010 compared to 11175 million in 2009 the principal source of cash from operating activities in 2010 was net earnings noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 5351 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows in 2010 provided 615 million of cash the resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program the resolution of these outstanding payments along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008 period and product liability payments contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in 2009 accrued expenses did not have any such significant variations in 2010 thus reflecting lower outflows in 2010 in our indirect statement of cash flows when compared to 2009 we have paid approximately 45 million and 25 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively related to durom cup product liability claims we estimate the remaining liability for durom cup claims as of december 31 2010 is 1328 million we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next three years 

 

at december 31 2010 we had 58 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable an increase of 2 days when compared to december 31 2009 reflecting some changes in collection practices that may have slightly increased days sales outstanding but have decreased our costs to collect at an acceptable risk level at december 31 2010 we had 307 days of inventory on hand a slight increase of 5 days compared to december 31 2009 

 

cash flows used in investing activities were 7269 million in 2010 compared to 3812 million in 2009 additions to instruments increased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period to support new product launches such as our continuum acetabular system and as we introduced new instrumentation in our knee product category such as posterior referencing instrumentation in 2011 we expect to spend approximately 140 to 150 million on instruments to support new products and sales growth spending on other property plant and equipment decreased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in 2010 during 2011 we expect to purchase approximately 110 to 120 million in other property plant and equipment reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new productrelated investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment beginning in 2009 and with more significance in 2010 we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities acquired intellectual property rights decreased to 85 million in 2010 compared to 358 million in 2009 and 1094 million in 2008 these items relate to lumpsum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements these lumpsum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangements included in investing cash flows in 2008 were 3630 million paid to acquire abbott spine and 549 million of proceeds we received from the sale of certain equity securities in the past three years we have made other smaller business acquisitions including beijing montagne medical device co ltd sodem diffusion sa and foreignbased distributors 

 

cash flows used in financing activities were 4896 million for 2010 compared to 2621 million in 2009 in 2010 the only significant cash we used in financing activities related to the repurchase of 5056 million of our common stock in november 2009 we sold 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes senior notes in a public offering we received net proceeds of approximately 9988 million net of an offering discount of 12 million we also paid an additional 85 million of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the senior notes we used cash from operating cash flows and some of the proceeds from the senior notes to repurchase 9237 million of our common stock in 2009 

 

the senior notes include two tranches 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent senior notes due november 30 2019 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 percent senior notes due november 30 2039 interest on the senior notes is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity 

 

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of 

 

 

 

 interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

 

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing november 30 2012 senior credit facility we had 1418 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2010 and an availability of 12082 million 

 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 778 million 

 

we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we invest only in highquality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had shortterm and longterm investments in debt securities with a fair value of 4106 million these investments are in debt securities of many different counterparties and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single counterparty all these debt securities are highlyrated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the counterparties is low 

 

as of december 31 2010 7253 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the us and expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences approximately 550 million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk the remaining is denominated in the various currencies where we operate 

 

we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2010 approximately 12 billion remained authorized under a 15 billion repurchase program which will expire on december 31 2013 

 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 

 

approximately 8 percent of the other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans they are not based upon future contributions due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and our intentions on voluntary contributions we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2011 therefore this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 

 

also included in other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made therefore this table does not include any obligations related to uncertain tax benefits see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these uncertain tax benefits 

 

we have entered into various contractual agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product rd milestones sales milestones or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made we have not included them in this table these payments could range from 0 to 60 million 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

 

excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of 

 

 

 

 our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprocess inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

 

income taxes  – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

 

commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 

 

in addition to our general product liability we have recorded “certain claims” provisions totaling 1790 million related to the durom cup including 750 million in 2010 the additional provision was needed in 2010 in part because we revised the definition of “certain claims” recorded in our statement of earnings to include worldwide claims relating to all revisions of durom cup cases where the original surgery was performed before our july 22 2008 suspension of marketing and distribution regardless of the time period elapsed between the original surgery and the revision surgery this additional provision represents management’s updated estimate of liability to durom cup patients undergoing revisions associated with original surgeries occurring before july 22 2008 the remaining liability as of december 31 2010 is 1328 million 

 

goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had intangible assets of 2107 million related to trademarks and trade names of which 1973 million are classified as having an indefinite life we currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names while it is possible it is not known if these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names if these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names these assets may be impaired 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 

 

as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of 2040 million during the year ended december 31 2010 in the year ended december 31 

 

 

 

 2009 we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of 730 million see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges 

 

we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit for each of those five reporting units the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value 

 

sharebased payment  – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

 

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2011 through june 2013 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2010 were 14 billion the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2010 were 2121 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december 31 2010 were eurousd 135 usdswiss franc 104 usdjapanese yen 8720 british poundusd 157 usdcanadian dollar 107 australian dollarusd 082 usdkorean won 1231 usdswedish krona 732 usdczech koruna 1957 usdthai baht 3127 usdtaiwan dollar 3062 usdsouth african rand 785 usdrussian ruble 3224 and usdindian ruppee 4808 

 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles and indian rupees with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2012 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 598 million 198 million 361 million 113 million 72 million 126 million 17 million 23 million 06 million 06 million 17 million 05 million 12 million and 11 million respectively any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

 

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 2250 million at december 31 2010 primarily in euros and japanese yen approximately 1295 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2010 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate 

 

 

 

 the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

 

we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highlyrated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits we also have shortterm and longterm investments in highlyrated corporate debt securities us government and agency debt securities us government treasury funds municipal bonds foreign government debt securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents presently all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at shortterm rates 

 

in december 2010 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of 250 million that hedge a portion of our 500 million 4625 percent senior notes due november 30 2019 on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december 31 2010 we receive a fixed interest rate of 4625 percent and we pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor plus an average of 133 basis points 

 

the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixedrate debt into variablerate debt the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 

 

these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 

 

based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2010 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on net interest expense this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments derivative instruments counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

 

we place our investments in highlyrated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

 

concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry where we do business there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer 

 

 

 

 management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of zimmer holdings inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

because of its inherent limitations the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

the company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  

 

based on that assessment management has concluded that as of december 31 2010 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 as stated in its report which appears in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend 

 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to management and the board of directors however no control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective 

 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of part ii item 7a

most of our new products fall into fda classifications that require the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the united states other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses all of our devices marketed in the united states have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of certain preamendment devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or 

 

 

 

 misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

 

our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as part of our global compliance program we seek to address fcpa risks proactively 

 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc synthes inc and tornier inc 

 

in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc and smith  nephew plc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including aesculap ag a subsidiary of b braun waldemar link gmbh  co kg and mathys ag which in addition to the global competitors compete with us today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market although global products are gaining acceptance we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation biomet trauma and biomet spine subsidiaries of biomet inc and nuvasive inc 

 

in the dental implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag astra tech dental and biomet 3i a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture substantially all of our products at nine sites including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey shannon ireland and etupes france 

 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational improvement and optimization our continuous improvement efforts are driven by lean and six sigma methodologies in addition at certain 

 

 

 

 of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at levels up to 90 percent of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource products currently purchased from outside vendors to onsite production 

 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced core products such as castings and forgings and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 

 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

 

employees 

 

we employ more than 8200 employees worldwide including more than 800 employees dedicated to research and development approximately 4900 employees are located within the united states and approximately 3300 employees are located outside of the united states primarily throughout europe and in japan we have over 3500 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs more than 1600 employees fewer than 200 north american employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

we have a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2012

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of 

 

 

 

 operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks related to our business 

 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement we entered into in september 2007 we may be subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

 

as previously reported in september 2007 we settled an investigation conducted by the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey us attorney into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons as part of that settlement we entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services oighhs a copy of the cia is filed as an exhibit to this report if we do not comply with the terms of the cia we could be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare 

 

we could be subject to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties based on allegations of wrongdoing similar to those made by the us attorney 

 

our settlement with the us government does not preclude other governmental agencies or state authorities from conducting investigations or instituting proceedings based on allegations of wrongdoing similar to those made by the us attorney as previously disclosed we are cooperating with the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice with regard to an ongoing investigation into potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry we are also cooperating with investigative demands made by two state attorneys general while we believe that the pending state investigations are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition similar investigations by other states or governmental agencies are possible we cannot assure that the costs of defending or resolving those investigations or proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our temporary suspension of the us marketing and distribution of one of our hip products has adversely affected sales growth resulted in claims and may adversely affect our ability to compete in the hip resurfacing market in the us 

 

as previously reported we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our durom acetabular component  durom cup in the us in july 2008 although we resumed us marketing and distribution in august 2008 we believe the effects of this action had a negative impact on our hip product sales growth through 2009 and may continue to have a negative impact in 2010 

 

following our action product liability lawsuits and other claims were asserted against us and additional similar claims may be asserted in addition our entry into the us hip resurfacing market has been delayed as the durom cup had been integral to our plans for entry into that market 

 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

  

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

  

moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these 

 

 

 

 enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more than 40 percent of our net sales from outside the united states we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in europe and japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective 

 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

 

the united states patent and trademark office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents future changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 

 

we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues if we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights we may be unable to manufacture sell or use some of our products 

 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following 

  

 

 

   

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

 

we are subject to putative stockholder class action lawsuits that could be costly to defend and distracting to management 

 

we and a number of our related parties are defending putative stockholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of the securities laws or violations of the federal employee retirement income security act of 1974 arising out of trading or ownership of our common stock we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend them vigorously we may incur significant expenses associated with the defense of these lawsuits however and the necessary participation of our executive officers could detract from their ability to devote their full time and attention to our business operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

the ongoing investigation by the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice regarding potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are cooperating fully with the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice with regard to an ongoing investigation of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we train our employees distributors and others concerning these issues we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not occur if we are found to have violated the foreign corrupt practices act we may face sanctions including fines criminal penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses 

 

the impact of healthcare reform in the us on us is uncertain 

 

there is increasing emphasis within the federal government to reform healthcare in the us though it is uncertain whether new legislation will be enacted to the extent that the number of uninsured or underinsured patients is reduced demand for our products could marginally increase however efforts to pay for healthcare reform through a proposed new tax on medical device companies and efforts to contain healthcare costs directly through pricing or reimbursement controls or indirectly by governmentsponsored healthcare insurance could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations accordingly the impact of healthcare reform on the medical device industry in general or us in particular remains uncertain 

 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to 

 

 

 

 reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including biological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

  

in markets outside of the united states other factors influence competition as well including 

  

our competitors may 

  

any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

 

in addition if we fail to comply with applicable material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations we may be subject to a range of sanctions including 

  

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business will be harmed 

 

we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

 

in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies typically have substantial retentions or deductibles that we are responsible for product liability claims in excess of applicable 

 

 

 

 insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants dental implants spinal implants trauma products and related surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as osp we also provide other healthcare related services we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments — the americas europe and asia pacific 

 

certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation 

 

beginning in 2009 we no longer include our dental product category sales within our reconstructive products category amounts in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 related to sales of dental products have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation 

 

we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

demand volume and mix trends 

 

 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 2 percentage points of 2009 sales growth which is 1 percentage point below the rate of growth from 2008 compared to 2007 

 

we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume temporarily decelerated from mid single digit growth rates to low single digit growth rates on a global basis due to the weakened global economy we believe longterm market growth rates will be driven by an aging global population obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the ongoing shift in demand to premium products such as longevity and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products hip stems with kinectiv technology highflex knees knee revision products porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices continues to positively affect sales growth our 2 percentage points of sales growth in 2009 from volume and changes in mix decreased from 2008 and was lower than market growth due to the impact of the disruptive events discussed below

global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2009 compared to flat pricing in 2008 selling prices in the americas decreased 1 percent during the year ended december 31 2009 compared to flat pricing in the same 2008 period europe selling prices were flat for the year ended december 31 2009 which is similar to the 2008 period asia pacific selling prices decreased 1 percent for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to a 3 percent decrease in the same 2008 period as we anniversaried out of scheduled reductions in reimbursement prices in japan with the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems we expect selling prices to decrease approximately 1 to 2 percent on a global basis for 2010 

 

foreign currency exchange rates 

 

 

for 2009 foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent decline in sales if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2009 year end rates we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2010 of approximately 1 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts and options solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

 

disruptive events 

 

 

we suffered customer losses as a result of disruptive factors experienced during 2008 including the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives our temporary suspension of us marketing and distribution of the durom cup and our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain osp patient care products we estimate that these customer losses reduced our global knee market share by approximately 15 percent and hip market share by approximately 2 percent on a cumulative basis through the end of 2008 these share losses affected sales growth in 2009 especially in the first six to nine months of the year but stabilized as we concluded the year 

 

global economic conditions 

 

 

we believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have resulted in a slowdown in elective hospital procedures we saw evidence of recovery in 2009 although the large developed countries in europe appear to be lagging the us and japan although many of our products are used in elective procedures we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than many medical product categories from swings in the broader economy because the need for these procedures does not diminish even if the 

 

 

 

 timing is affected in particular our dental revenues have experienced pressure due to the weak economic environment as many of those procedures are not reimbursed by thirdparty payors 

 

2010 outlook 

 

 

in the second half of 2009 we saw encouraging signs that orthopaedic procedure volumes in certain markets were recovering our market assumptions are that in 2010 knee and hip procedures will grow in mid single digits within the americas and asia pacific markets and remain flat to slightly positive in the large developed markets in europe given the expected pacing of our new product launches such as the zimmer mmc cup continuum acetabular system and zimmer patient specific instruments we anticipate our sales growth in 2010 to be greater in the second half of the year 

 

we expect to continue making investments in rd in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales assuming currency rates remain at year end 2009 levels we expect our gross margin to be approximately 75 percent of sales in 2010 this takes into account the higher cost inventory we carry into 2010 as well as projected foreign currency hedge losses partially offset by lower anticipated excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2010 we expect the gross margin ratio to be slightly lower in the first half of 2010 as compared to the second half of the year sga as a percent of sales is expected to decrease for the full year as we restore leverage from revenue growth offset in part by sales and marketing investments in support of new product launches we have completed the infrastructure investment projects in eschbach germany our automated centralized distribution facility for the europe middle east and africa region and in shannon ireland our new implant manufacturing facility both facilities are now operational and should provide economic benefits for the full year 2010 

 

we expect interest expense will be unfavorable yearoveryear due to the 1 billion senior notes offering we completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 the impact of this expense on our diluted earnings per share should be more than offset by the additional shares we repurchased with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering

the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

 

 

  

 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lcck revision knee led knee sales in addition the gender solutions naturalknee flex system made a strong contribution in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected knee sales by 6 percent 

 

  

 

the continued conversion to porous stems including the zimmer ml taper stem the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem led hip stem sales but those sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems trabecular metal acetabular cups and longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners also made strong contributions in the us hip market we had some product gaps related to our acetabular cups which have affected sales growth this was most noticeable in the area of metalonmetal articulation in november 2009 the continuum acetabular system and the zimmer mmc cup were cleared for sale in the us these systems give surgeons a comprehensive array of acetabular cup solutions that in concert with our comprehensive stem portfolio provide additional patient matching options these cups have also received approval in various countries outside the us and will help complete our product portfolios in those countries as well in europe changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected hip sales by 6 percent in asia pacific changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by 4 percent 

 

  

 

the biglianiflatow complete shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales trabecular metal technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market 

 

  

 

the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales negative sales growth for our dental business reflects overall weakness in the global economy we continue to believe the dental market will rebound as the global economy recovers and look forward to new opportunities as our product line is expanded through internal and external development efforts 

 

  

 

zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales but were partially offset by declining sales of compression hip screws femoral and tibial nails within the new zimmer natural nail system also made a contribution during the year 

 

  

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we acquired abbott spine as a result of the acquisition spine sales have increased but the increase is offset in part by sales losses associated with the integration of the business solid sales of acquired fusion devices as well as legacy interbody devices and bone graft substitutes partly offset a significant decline in sales of the dynesys dynamic stabilization system during the year we expect our spinal business will continue to experience reimbursement challenges related to the dynesys system following the november 2009 nonapprovable recommendation by the fda advisory panel of our request for additional approved uses for the dynesys system we are exploring our options which are presently uncertain we believe that we generally have a solid portfolio of spine products as well as broad global distribution capabilities that should lead to improved performance over time 

 

  

 

osp sales were led by palacos bone cement osp product sales growth improved in the second half of 2009 due to the effect of anniversarying out of the voluntary suspension and recall of certain products during 2008 and by the reintroduction of wound debridement products in 2009 

 

 

 

  

the following table presents estimated 2009 global market size and market share information dollars in billions 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

gross margin in 2009 was unchanged compared to 2008 manufacturing costs per unit increased in 2009 due to lower production levels excess inventory and obsolescence charges increased in 2009 as a result of certain productspecific matters and new product launches these costs were offset by foreign currency hedge gains recognized in the 2009 period compared to hedge losses recognized in 2008 

 

under our hedging program for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings 

 

the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2008 to 2009 

 

 

 

  

 

research and development expense or rd increased to 2054 million in 2009 from 1923 million in 2008 this increase reflects additional spending on certain development clinical and external research activities throughout 2009 in contrast to the delay in activities experienced in 2008 as we implemented our enhanced compliance program 

 

selling general and administrative expense or sga increased to 17292 million in 2009 from 17040 million in 2008 this is an increase of approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year sga expense in the 2008 period included approximately 60 million of incremental costs such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global rollout of our enhanced compliance program the savings from these costs in 2009 have been offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs abbott spine costs and increased product liability claims in this challenging economic environment we are carefully managing our sga spend reducing expenses in certain areas in order to fund growth and productivity initiatives areas of investment include marketing and promotion and medical education and training the acquisition of abbott spine increased sga costs for items such as selling expenses increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets additionally sga as a percentage of net sales is negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates a majority of our sga spend is incurred in the us primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as dental trauma spine and osp therefore sga expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue which has caused sga as a percentage of net sales to increase 

 

certain claims expense is a provision for estimated durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified times a provision of 690 million was originally recorded during 2008 with an additional 350 million recorded during 2009 bringing the total provision to 1040 million for these claims for more information regarding these claims see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 we noted that the carrying value of the assets of our us spine reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value as a result we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of 730 million during the year ended december 31 2009 for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit for each of those five reporting units the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value 

 

 

 

  

acquisition integration realignment and other expenses for 2009 were 753 million compared to 685 million in 2008 during 2009 we initiated a workforce realignment which included the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support longterm growth as a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions we incurred approximately 190 million of severance and terminationrelated expenses other items in acquisition integration realignment and other expenses in 2009 included approximately 94 million of expenses related to contract termination costs 234 million of certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs incurred to integrate the abbott spine business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 included in acquisition integration realignment and other expenses in 2008 was 385 million of inprocess research and development related to the abbott spine acquisition and other costs related to the integration of abbott spine see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these charges 

 

we recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of 321 million during 2009 related to amending our us and puerto rico postretirement benefit plans for more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

  

 

operating profit for 2009 decreased 7 percent to 10188 million from 10900 million in 2008 the decrease in operating profit is due to higher operating expenses most notably the goodwill impairment charge 

 

interest and other expense for 2009 increased to 206 million compared to income of 318 million in 2008 interest and other income in 2008 included a realized gain of 388 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities interest expense increased in the 2009 period as the result of increased longterm debt used to partially fund the abbott spine acquisition and the 10 billion senior notes offering during 2009 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes increased to 281 percent for 2009 up from 243 percent in 2008 the effective tax rate for 2009 is negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charge of 730 million recorded during 2009 for which no tax benefit was recorded the effective tax rate for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit of 317 million related to the 2007 settlement expense resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent in the 2008 effective tax rate this impact on the 2008 effective tax rate was partially offset by abbott spine acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded these discrete items account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rate yearoveryear 

 

net earnings decreased 15 percent to 7174 million for 2009 compared to 8486 million in 2008 as a result of decreased operating profit increased interest expense and an increased effective tax rate basic earnings per share in 2009 decreased 10 percent to 334 from 373 in 2008 diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent to 332 from 372 in 2008 the disproportional change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2009 and 2008 share repurchases

the following table presents net sales by product category by region dollars in millions 

 

 

 

  

 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lcck revision knee led knee sales in addition the zimmer unicompartmental highflex knee and the gender solutions naturalknee flex system exhibited strong growth changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 5 percent in europe and by 6 percent in asia pacific 

 

  

 

the continued conversion to porous stems including the zimmer ml taper stem the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem led hip stem sales but those sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems trabecular metal acetabular cups and longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners also had strong growth the temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the durom cup in the us negatively impacted hip sales growth changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by 5 percent in europe and by 8 percent in asia pacific 

 

  

 

the biglianiflatow complete shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales 

 

  

 

orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants including strong growth of the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales 

 

  

 

zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales 

 

  

 

the dynesys dynamic stabilization system and the trinica select anterior cervical plate system led spine sales which also reflect an increase as a result of the abbott spine acquisition 

 

  

 

osp sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products but these negative factors 

 

 

 

 were partially offset by strong growth in palacos bone cement 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

gross margin decreased in 2008 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of yearoveryear changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses as well as an increase in excess inventory and obsolescence charges due to writeoffs related to the osp patient care product recalls and increased inventory levels as a result of lower than forecasted sales inventory stepup related to the completion of the abbott spine acquisition during 2008 also had an unfavorable impact on gross margin 

 

the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2007 to 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

 

rd increased to 1923 million for 2008 from 1826 million in 2007 but remained unchanged as a percent of total sales the yearoveryear increase represents our continued investment in rd to grow at or above sales growth 

 

sga expense increased to 17040 million for 2008 from 15167 million in 2007 increased sga costs include monitor fees paid as part of our 2007 civil settlement with the us government regarding financial relationships with consulting orthopaedic surgeons as well as consulting and legal fees associated with the global implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives expenses related to other operating initiatives also caused an increase in sga as a percentage of net sales such operating initiatives include the planned implementation of a global it system and improving quality systems at our dover facility additionally selling costs increased as a result of the orthosoft acquisition an increase in the headcount of our sales force in certain locations increased commission incentives to sell certain key products and a change in the mix of commissions earned as a result of lower osp sales 

 

settlement expense of 1695 million for 2007 relates to the payment we made as part of the 2007 civil settlement 

 

certain claims expense of 690 million is a provision for estimated claims from durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified periods for more information regarding these claims see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

acquisition integration and other expenses increased to 685 million for 2008 compared to 252 million in 2007 the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2008 include 385 million for inprocess research and development related to the abbott spine acquisition costs related to the integration of abbott spine facility consolidation costs legal fees and retention and termination payments partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired companies the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect inprocess research and development writeoffs related to acquisitions costs related to the integration of acquired us distributors estimated settlements for certain preacquisition product liability claims integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these charges 

 

  

 

operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to 10900 million from 11276 million in 2007 operating profit for 2007 included the effect of the nonrecurring settlement expense of 1695 million excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007 operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins increases in sga costs attributable to the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and certain claims expense of 690 million 

 

interest and other income for 2008 increased to 318 million from 40 million in 2007 interest and other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of 388 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of an increase in outstanding longterm debt 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes decreased to 243 percent for 2008 down from 316 percent in 2007 the effective tax rate for the 2007 period reflects the effect of the 1695 million settlement expense for which no tax benefit had previously been recognized during 2008 we recorded a current tax benefit of 317 million related to the settlement expense resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent to the current period effective tax rate the effective tax rate for 2008 was further reduced as a result of increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions these decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by abbott spine acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

 charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded 

 

net earnings increased 10 percent to 8486 million for 2008 compared to 7732 million in 2007 as the decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14 percent to 373 and 372 respectively from 328 and 326 in 2007 the higher growth rate in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and 2007 share repurchases 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 11175 million in 2009 compared to 10381 million in 2008 the principal source of cash from operating activities in 2009 was net earnings noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 4464 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows in 2009 reflect a use of 463 million of cash the resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we implemented our enhanced global compliance program the resolution of these outstanding payments along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008 period and product liability payments contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in 2009 these outflows were partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections and better inventory management 

 

at december 31 2009 we had 56 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable a decrease of 3 days when compared to december 31 2008 reflecting improved collections across all geographic segments at december 31 2009 we had 302 days of inventory on hand a decrease of 42 days compared to december 31 2008 over the past two years we have made significant investments in inventory including investments in response to growing demand for systems that provide more versatility and better fit for patients in 2009 we made progress rationalizing these investments through reductions in fieldbased consignments and through the use of new inventory management tools to speed returns and redeployments the continued build out of pipeline inventory for planned product launches should partially offset these reductions in field consignments in 2010 

 

cash flows used in investing activities were 3812 million in 2009 compared to 9242 million in 2008 additions to instruments decreased in 2009 compared to the 2008 period as yearoveryear spending on instruments declined compared to the significant investments made in 2008 in 2010 we expect to spend approximately 170 – 180 million on instruments to support new products and sales growth spending on other property plant and equipment decreased to 1051 million during 2009 compared to 2500 million in the same 2008 period spending on property plant and equipment decreased compared to 2008 levels as certain planned infrastructure initiatives from 2008 were completed and as we adjusted spending to lower production volumes during 2010 we expect to purchase approximately 150 – 160 million in other property plant and equipment reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new productrelated investments and normal replacement of older machinery and equipment acquired intellectual property rights were 358 million in 2009 compared to 1094 million in 2008 these items relate to lumpsum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements these lumpsum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangements during 2009 we invested excess cash of approximately 664 million in certificates of deposit that have original maturities greater than 90 days investments in other assets in both 2009 and 2008 primarily relate to payments to acquire certain foreignbased distributors investments in other assets in 2007 primarily related to payments to acquire endius and orthosoft included in investing cash flows in 2008 were 3630 million paid to acquire abbott spine and 549 million of proceeds we received from the sale of certain equity securities 

 

cash flows used in financing activities were 2621 million for 2009 compared to 3435 million in 2008 in november 2009 we sold 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes senior notes in a public offering we received net proceeds of approximately 9988 million net of an offering discount of 12 million we also paid an additional 85 million of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the senior notes the proceeds of the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility to finance our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes we repurchased 9237 million of our common stock in 2009 as compared with 7370 million in 2008 under our stock repurchase programs 

 

the senior notes include two tranches 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior notes due november 30 2019 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 senior notes due november 30 2039 interest on the senior notes is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year beginning on may 30 2010 until maturity the senior notes are rated a by standard  poor’s ratings services and are rated baa1 by moody’s investors’ service inc 

 

we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 

 

 

 

  

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing november 30 2012 senior credit facility we had 1288 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2009 and an availability of 12212 million the senior credit facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to 1750 million 

 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 841 million 

 

we may use excess cash or further borrow against our senior credit facility subject to limits set by our board of directors to repurchase additional common stock under the 125 billion program which expires december 31 2010 approximately 2111 million remains authorized for future repurchases under this plan 

 

management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

 

excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprogress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

 

income taxes  – our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 

 

we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances including existing tax laws our experience with previous settlement agreements the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 

 

we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

 

commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development 

 

 

 

 over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model during 2009 in addition to our general product liability estimates and the 690 million provision recorded in 2008 related to the durom cup we recorded an additional provision for certain claims of 350 million representing management’s updated estimate of liability to durom cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries occurring before july 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date these parameters are consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique are most likely to occur within that time period we expect to pay the majority of these claims within the next three years any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals 

 

goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined our us spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit factors that contributed to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit being below its carrying value included a decrease in projected revenues related to the dynesys dynamic stabilization system this product line experienced increased competition and insurance reimbursement issues in 2009 we have been seeking approval from the fda to market this product differently in the us which would enhance its position in the market however in november 2009 an fda advisory panel issued a nonapprovable recommendation increasing the uncertainty of the estimated future cash flows in addition to the dynesys product revenues from other products have been affected as we work through the integration of the sales channel following the abbott spine acquisition 

 

as a result we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of 730 million during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

we have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them we estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit for each of those five reporting units the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value 

 

sharebased payment  – we measure sharebased payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

 

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won and swedish krona we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars korean won and swedish krona and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2010 through june 2012 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 11 billion and 13 billion respectively the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 2024 million and 2075 million respectively the weighted average contract rates outstanding are eurousd 140 usdswiss franc 110 usdjapanese yen 94 british poundusd 166 usdcanadian dollar 111 australian dollarusd 075 usdkorean won 1208 and usdswedish krona 752 

 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar korean won and swedish krona with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2012 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 549 million 205 million 250 million 102 million 47 million 99 million 29 million and 18 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar korean won and swedish krona contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

 

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 2346 million at december 31 2009 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1309 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2009 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a 

 

 

 

 material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

 

presently we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in us government treasury funds and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates and are not exposed to any risk from movement in interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities presently all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at shortterm rates we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure but we may do so in the future based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2009 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

 

we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 

 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

 

concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

 item 1 business tableend 

 

overview 

 

we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants spinal implants trauma products and related surgical products we also provide other healthcare related services in this report “zimmer” “we” “us” “our” and similar words refer collectively to zimmer holdings inc and its subsidiaries zimmer holdings refers to the parent company only 

 

there were several developments in 2008 that had a significant impact on our business 

 

we continued to meet our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” and the corporate integrity agreement “cia” we signed in september 2007 during 2008 we devoted substantial resources to meet our obligations under those agreements and implemented enhancements to our corporate compliance program applicable in most respects to all of our businesses on a global basis 

 

in the first half of 2008 we initiated voluntary product recalls of certain orthopaedic surgical products “osp” manufactured at our dover ohio facility that we determined did not meet internal quality standards additionally we voluntarily and temporarily suspended production and sales of certain osp products manufactured at the dover facility we expect to have a significant portion of these products back into production by the end of the first quarter of 2009 with most other products coming back into production in the second quarter of 2009 

 

in july 2008 we suspended marketing and distribution of the durom ® acetabular component  durom cup in the us to permit us to update product labeling and implement a surgical training program in the us we resumed marketing and distribution of the durom cup in the us in august 2008 we received claims from a number of durom cup patients seeking reimbursement for costs and payments for alleged pain and suffering and we recorded a provision for certain claims of 690 million in 2008 which represents management’s estimate of liability to patients undergoing revision surgeries related to the durom cup in addition we expect that our entry into the us hip resurfacing market may be hindered or delayed as the durom cup has been integral to our plans for entry into that market 

 

in october 2008 we acquired abbott spine previously a subsidiary of abbott laboratories for approximately 360 million this investment adds a number of innovative products and helps build toward critical mass in the spine product category the acquisition also enhances our research and development capabilities in the spine product category and strengthens our sales coverage 

 

zimmer holdings was incorporated in delaware in 2001 our history dates to 1927 when zimmer manufacturing company a predecessor was founded in warsaw i ndiana on august 6 2001 zimmer holdings was spun off from its former parent and became an independent public company

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals or direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and in the asia pacific region healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes generally upon shipment direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2008 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2008 

 

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel most of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and 

 

 

 

 

organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to musculoskeletal surgeons neurosurgeons dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform 

 

americas the americas is our largest geographic segment accounting for 23539 million or 57 percent of 2008 net sales with the united states accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region the united states sales force primarily consists of independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer sales agents in the united states receive a commission on product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions and costs sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale 

 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

 

a majority of hospitals in the united states belong to at least one group purchasing organization in 2008 individual hospital orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our two largest group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately 35 percent of our net sales in the united states contractual sales were highest through novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp no individual enduser however accounted for over 1 percent of our net sales and the top ten endusers accounted for approximately 4 percent of our aggregate net sales in the united states

we utilize our exclusive trabecular metal tm technology across various product categories trabecular metal material is a structural biomaterial whose cellular architecture resembles bone and approximates its physical and mechanical properties more closely than other prosthetic materials the highly porous trabecular configuration is conducive to more normal bone formation and bone ingrowth trabecular metal implants are fabricated using elemental tantalum metal and a patented vapor deposition technique that creates a metallic strut configuration resembling cancellous bone with nanotextured surface features 

 

 

 

 

 

orthopaedic reconstructive implants 

 

  

 

total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articular surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime or primary joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining cr designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized ps and ultracongruent uc designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis 

 

our portfolio of minimally invasive solutions tm procedures “mis” includes the mis miniincision total knee procedure the mis miniincision total knee instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues 

 

we offer a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including the following

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques materials orthobiologics and product designs the research and development functions work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials orthobiologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth 

 

we are broadening our product offerings in each of the product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we spent 1940 million 2096 million and 1883 million respectively on research and development the decreased spending on research and development in 2008 reflects delays connected with our operational compliance with the dpa and cia and implementation of our enhanced compliance and ethics initiatives we intend to increase spending on product development in 2009 our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana we have other research and development personnel based in among other places winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2008 we employed more than 800 research and development employees worldwide 

 

we expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and consider acquiring complementary products or businesses or establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

 

government regulation and compliance 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the us numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

 

most of our new products fall into fda classifications that require the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the united states other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses all of our devices marketed in the united states have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of certain preamendment devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required some low risk medical devices including most instruments also do not require fda review and approval or clearance prior to commercial distribution the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement of or refund the costs of such devices there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device 

 

 

 

 

directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs as part of meeting our obligations under the 2007 dpa we developed and have substantially implemented enhanced compliance initiatives and are applying these enhancements in most respects to all of our businesses on a global basis 

 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and related surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc synthes inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and tornier inc 

 

in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc and smith  nephew plc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including mathys ag and waldemar link gmbh  co kg which in addition to the global competitors compete with us today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for the european market although global products are gaining acceptance we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp now operating as biomet trauma and biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies 

 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture substantially all of our products at eight sites including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey and etupes france in february 2008 we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in shannon ireland and are scheduled to open the facility in the second half of 2009 

 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry standards in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational improvement and optimization in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained to perform a broad array of operations 

 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at levels up to 90 percent of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource products currently purchased from outside vendors to onsite production 

 

we have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs we have for example employed computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls purchased stateoftheart equipment insourced 

 

 

 

 

core products such as castings and forgings and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 

 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

 

employees 

 

we employ more than 8500 employees worldwide including more than 800 employees dedicated to research and development over 5200 employees are located within the united states and approximately 3300 employees are located outside of the united states primarily throughout europe and in japan we have over 3600 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs more than 1600 employees fewer than 200 north american employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

in may 2007 we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2012

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks related to our business 

 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement and corporate integrity agreement we entered into in september 2007 we may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

 

as previously reported in september 2007 we settled an investigation conducted by the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey the “us attorney” into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement the “dpa” with the us attorney and a corporate integrity agreement the “cia” with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the “oighhs” copies of the dpa and cia are filed as exhibits to this report and a copy of the dpa is available on our website at wwwzimmercom 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not comply with the terms of these agreements we could be subject to prosecution for violations of the federal antikickback statute that the us attorney alleges we committed between 2002 and 2006 as well as any new or continuing violations we could also be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare 

 

we could be subject to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties based on allegations of wrongdoing similar to those made by the us attorney 

 

our settlement with the us government does not preclude other governmental agencies or state authorities from conducting investigations or instituting proceedings based on allegations of wrongdoing similar to those made by the us attorney as previously disclosed we are cooperating with the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice with regard to an informal investigation into potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry we are also cooperating with investigative demands made by two state attorneys general while we believe that the pending state investigations are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition similar investigations by other states or governmental agencies are possible in addition the settlement with the government could increase our exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers under the federal false claims acts based on new theories or allegations arising from the allegations made by the us attorney we intend to review and take appropriate actions with respect to any such investigations or proceedings however we cannot assure that the costs of defending or resolving those investigations or proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

if we are not able to fulfill or otherwise resolve our existing royalty and other payment obligations to healthcare professional consultants and institutions our ability to maintain our existing intellectual property rights and obtain future rights may be impaired 

 

we have reviewed our existing royalty agreements with healthcare professional consultants and institutions in light of the requirements of the dpa following our review we resumed paying royalties with respect to some of the agreements with respect to others we made lumpsum payments to resolve our accrued and future royalty obligations and secure rights to the intellectual property with respect to the remaining agreements if we do not fulfill our obligations or reach some other resolution acceptable to the affected healthcare professional consultants and institutions our ability to use the intellectual property covered by those agreements may be adversely affected in addition our ability to enter into new agreements with healthcare professional consultants or institutions for the future acquisition of intellectual property rights may be adversely affected 

 

our temporary suspension of the us marketing and distribution of one of our hip products has adversely affected sales resulted in claims and may adversely affect our ability to compete in the growing hip resurfacing market in the us 

 

in july 2008 we temporarily suspended the marketing and distribution of our durom acetabular component  durom cup in the us we believe this action adversely affected our hip product sales in the us in the last half of 2008 although we resumed us marketing and distribution in august 2008 we expect the effects of this action will continue to have a negative impact through 2009 

 

following our action product liability lawsuits and other claims were asserted against us and we expect additional similar claims will be asserted in addition we expect that our entry into the growing us hip resurfacing market has been delayed as the durom cup had been integral to our plans for entry into that market 

 

the implementation of our enhanced global compliance program is requiring us to devote substantial resources is disruptive to normal business activities and may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

since entering into the dpa and cia we have devoted substantial resources to meet our obligations under those agreements and implemented enhancements to our global compliance program applicable in most respects to all of our businesses on a global basis these efforts have not only involved significant expense but also required management and other key employees to focus extensively on these matters preventing them from devoting as much time as they otherwise would to other business matters if our competitors do not make similar enhancements to their compliance programs this may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we believe we have lost market share as a result of recent events if we are not able to recover or grow our market share our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

we believe that the disruptive effects of the product suspensions and recalls in 2008 and the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives contributed to customer losses during the last half of 2008 we may not be able to recapture market share lost due to these events and we may continue to lose customers due to these factors in the future 

 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

  

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

  

moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more than 40 of our net sales from outside the united states we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks 

 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in europe and japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments those actions may not prove to be fully effective the current global economic crisis has generally increased the risk of entering into derivative financial instruments even if major international financial institutions act as counterparties 

 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

 

 

 

 

 

the united states patent and trademark office and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents future changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which could limit our growth and revenue 

 

we also attempt to protect our trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these measures may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages 

 

we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues if we were to lose such litigation involving material intellectual property rights we may be unable to manufacture sell or use some of our products 

 

we may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights these activities involve risks including the following 

  

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products 

 

we are subject to putative stockholder class action lawsuits that could be costly to defend and distracting to management 

 

we and a number of our related parties are defending putative stockholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of the securities laws breaches of fiduciary duties or violations of the federal employee retirement income security act of 1974 arising out of trading or ownership of our common stock we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend them vigorously we may incur significant expenses associated with the defense of these lawsuits however and the necessary participation of our executive officers could detract from their ability to devote their full time and attention to our business operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

the ongoing informal investigation by the us securities and exchange commission regarding potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are cooperating fully with the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice with regard to an ongoing informal investigation of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we train our employees distributors and others concerning these issues we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not occur if we are found to have violated the foreign corrupt practices act we may face sanctions including fines criminal penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses 

 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims 

 

 

 

 

laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change 

 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

continuing weakness in the global economy is likely to adversely affect our business until an economic recovery is underway 

 

a significant portion of our products are used in procedures covered by private insurance many of which including procedures using our dental products may be considered elective procedures we expect the current global economic crisis is likely to reduce the availability or affordability of private insurance or may impact patient decisions to have an elective procedure performed if current economic conditions continue or worsen we expect that increasing levels of unemployment and pressures to contain healthcare costs could adversely affect the global growth rate of hip and knee procedure volume which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including orthobiological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies competition is primarily on the basis of 

  

in markets outside of the united states other factors influence competition as well including 

  

our competitors may 

  

any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

 

 

 

 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs 

 

in addition if we fail to comply with applicable material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations we may be subject to a range of sanctions including 

  

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business will be harmed 

 

we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

 

in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

 

although we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies typically have substantial retentions or deductibles that we are responsible for product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we have the following properties 

 

 

 

we began construction of our new 125000 square feet shannon ireland facility in 2008 and expect to begin manufacturing operations at this facility in the second half of 2009 in an effort to expand our global distribution network we have begun construction on a 130000 square feet warehouse facility in eschbach germany we expect to begin utilizing this facility in the second half of 2009 we believe the current facilities including manufacturing warehousing research and development and office space together with the planned expansion provide sufficient capacity to meet ongoing demands once a facility reaches 85 percent utilization we examine alternatives for either expanding that facility or acquiring new facilities to meet our ongoing demands 

 

in addition to the above we maintain more than 100 other offices and warehouse facilities in more than 25 countries around the world including the united states japan australia france russia india germany italy switzerland and china we believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good condition well maintained and able to operate at present levels

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants spinal implants trauma products and related surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as “osp” we also provide other healthcare related services orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and postoperation rehabilitation we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments – the americas europe and asia pacific 

 

certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation 

 

beginning in 2008 our hips product category sales no longer include bone cement and accessory sales which have been reclassified to our osp and other product category amounts in the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 related to sales of bone cement and accessory products have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation 

 

we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

demand volume and mix trends 

 

 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 3 percentage points of 2008 sales growth which is 6 percentage points below the rate of growth from 2007 compared to 2006 we estimate that the orthopaedic procedure volume market growth rate on a global basis will be in the mid single digits in the coming years driven by an aging global population obesity and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the continued shift in demand to premium products such as longevity  durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products highflex knees knee revision products and porous hip stems continue to positively affect sales growth our 2008 increase of 3 percentage points decreased from 2007 and was lower than market growth due to the factors discussed below 

 

pricing trends 

 

 

selling prices were flat during 2008 which is similar to 2007 when compared to 2006 asia pacific selling prices decreased 3 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to a 1 percent decrease in 2007 when compared to 2006 japan and australia reported 4 percent and 3 percent decreases respectively in average selling prices as a result of scheduled reductions in reimbursement prices japan and australia combined represent approximately 10 percent of our sales selling prices in the americas were flat during 2008 compared to a 1 percent increase in 2007 in europe selling prices for 2008 were flat compared to a 1 percent decrease in 2007 with the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing organizations we expect global selling prices to remain flat in 2009 

 

foreign currency exchange rates 

 

 

for 2008 foreign currency exchange rates had a positive 3 percent effect on global sales growth if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2009 of approximately 4 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts and options solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts and options which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

 

abbott spine acquisition 

 

 

in october 2008 we acquired abbott spine previously a subsidiary of abbott laboratories for approximately 360 million the purchase price was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities this investment adds a number of innovative products and helps build toward critical mass in the spine product category the acquisition also enhances our research and development capabilities in the spine product category and strengthens our sales coverage we recorded 487 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2008 as a result of this transaction including 385 million of inprocess research and development expense for more information regarding the acquisition of abbott spine see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

 

 

 

 

compliancerelated matters 

 

 

in september 2007 we and other major us orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with the us government to resolve claims related to an investigation into financial relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons we paid the government 1695 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa under which we will remain subject to oversight by a federallyappointed monitor through march 27 2009 

 

we also entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which has a term of 5 years for more information regarding the settlement see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

we did not record any tax benefit related to the 1695 million payment in 2007 during 2008 we reached an agreement with the us internal revenue service confirming the deductibility of a portion of the payment and recorded a current tax benefit of 317 million resulting in a decrease to the current period effective tax rate for more information regarding the tax treatment of the settlement expense see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

we have developed and substantially implemented enhanced global compliance initiatives which address areas such as product development marketing surgeon training and educational and charitable funding the principles of this program meet or exceed the requirements of the dpa and cia as those principles are being applied in most respects to all product segments and reach all worldwide operations costs related to the dpa cia and the enhanced compliance initiatives in 2008 were approximately 60 million including the fees incurred for the federallyappointed monitor 

 

durom acetabular component 

 

 

in july 2008 we temporarily suspended marketing and distribution of the durom acetabular component  durom cup in the us to permit us to update product labeling to provide more detailed surgical technique instructions and implement an enhanced surgical training program in the us we resumed marketing and distribution of the durom cup in the us in august 2008 

 

during 2008 we received claims from a number of durom cup patients seeking reimbursement for costs and payments for alleged pain and suffering and we expect to receive additional similar claims we recorded a provision for certain claims of 690 million in 2008 which represents management’s estimate of liability to patients undergoing revision surgeries related to the durom cup the estimate is limited to revisions associated with surgeries occurring before july 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals 

 

we believe we lost hip product sales during 2008 in large part as a consequence of the events involving the durom cup in addition we expect that our entry into the us hip resurfacing market has been hindered or delayed as the durom cup had previously been integral to our plans for entry into that market 

 

orthopaedic surgical products osp actions 

 

 

in the first half of 2008 we initiated voluntary product recalls of certain osp patient care products manufactured at our dover ohio facility that we determined did not meet internal quality standards and we temporarily suspended production and sales of certain osp products manufactured at the dover facility we estimate that these actions adversely impacted 2008 osp revenues by approximately 70 million and 2008 diluted earnings per share by 018 including related inventory charges idle plant costs and other nonrecurring charges we expect to have a significant portion of these products back in production in the first quarter of 2009 with most other products coming back into production in the second quarter of 2009 

 

impact of disruptive events on market share 

 

 

as a result of the disruptive factors discussed above including our temporary suspension of us marketing and distribution of the durom cup our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain osp patient care products and the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives we have suffered customer losses during 2008 we estimate that these customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by 15 to 20 percent as measured from fourth quarter results we expect our sales growth to be at a rate slower than the market in the near term due to these disruptive factors 

 

2009 outlook 

 

 

we expect conditions in the broader economy will result in a temporary slowdown in elective hospital procedures although many of our products are used in elective procedures we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than most from swings in the broader economy because the need for these procedures does not diminish even if the timing is affected 

 

we expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 affecting our knee and hip market share as a result of the ongoing effects of the disruptive factors discussed above our assumption is that share loss should stabilize by yearend 2009 as we anniversary out of the majority of the 2008 customer and productrelated losses and as we launch new products in sufficient quantities to recover some of the productrelated losses 

 

among our other product categories we expect extremities and trauma sales growth to be in line with market growth rates we expect dental revenues to reflect the weak economic environment and to underperform relative to market growth rates given companyspecific operational challenges finally we expect spine revenues to increase as a result of the abbott spine acquisition and reflect sales dissynergies associated with the ongoing integration of the two businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2009 our operating expenses will be impacted by a number of factors which in the aggregate are expected to result in a modest net decrease in total expense compared to 2008 we expect to realize significant savings from thirdparty fees related to compliance with the dpa and the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives duromrelated certain claims and acquisition integration and other expenses for 2009 however we intend to partially offset those savings with increased spending in areas that suffered disruption in 2008 including product development and medical education we also continue to stepup our level of spending on quality systems to achieve our continuous improvement objectives in the areas of design and process control as well as ongoing product surveillance

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including gender solutions knee femoral implants the nexgen lpsflex knee the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lcck revision knee led knee sales in addition the zimmer unicompartmental highflex knee and the gender solutions naturalknee flex system exhibited strong growth 

 

the continued conversion to porous stems including the zimmer ml taper stem the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system  and the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem led hip stem sales but was partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems trabecular metal acetabular cups and longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners also had strong growth the temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the durom cup in the us negatively impacted hip sales growth additionally with the lack of a hip resurfacing product within our us hip portfolio we expect to face a continuing challenge in hip sales growth with the adoption of hip resurfacing in the us market 

 

as a result of the disruptive factors discussed above we suffered customer losses during 2008 we estimate that these customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by 15 to 20 percent as measured from fourth quarter results we expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors 

 

the biglianiflatow complete shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants including strong growth of the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales zimmer periarticular locking plates and the itst intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales the dynesys dynamic stabilization 

 

 

 

 

system and the trinica select anterior cervical plate system led spine sales which also reflect an increase as a result of the abbott spine acquisition osp sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products but these negative factors were partially offset by strong growth in palacos bone cement

the following table presents americas net sales dollars in millions 

 

 

 

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including the gender solutions knee femoral implants nexgen lpsflex knee the nexgen lcck revision knee and the nexgen crflex knee led knee sales the gender solutions naturalknee flex system also made a strong contribution 

 

growth in porous stems including growth of the zimmer ml taper stem and the zimmer ml taper stem with kinectiv technology led hip stem sales but was partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems trabecular metal acetabular cups and longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners also made a strong contribution as noted above the temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the durom cup in the us will continue to negatively impact hip sales and we also expect that the adoption of hip resurfacing in the us market will continue to adversely affect our hip sales growth 

 

as a result of the disruptive factors discussed above we suffered customer losses during 2008 these customer losses negatively impacted sales growth primarily in the knee and hip product segments we expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors 

 

the biglianiflatow shoulder solution and the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales negative sales growth for our dental business reflects disruptions caused by the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and overall weakness in the us economy zimmer periarticular plates and the itst intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system led trauma sales the dynesys dynamic stabilization system and the trinica select anterior cervical plate system led spine sales which also reflect an increase as a result of the abbott spine acquisition osp sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products but these negative factors were partially offset by strong growth in palacos bone cement 

 

  

 

the following table presents europe net sales dollars in millions 

 

 

changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected both knee and hip sales by 5 percent the nexgen complete knee solution product line including the nexgen lpsflex knee the nexgen lcck revision knee and the nexgen crflex knee led knee sales in our europe region 

 

growth in porous stems including the cls spotorno stem led hip stem sales longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners trabecular metal acetabular cups and the allofit ® hip acetabular system also contributed to hip sales 

 

as a result of the disruptive factors discussed above we suffered customer losses during 2008 these customer losses negatively impacted sales growth primarily in the knee and hip product segments we expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors 

 

the anatomical shoulder system and the coonradmorrey total elbow led extremities sales the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales the cableready ® cable grip system and the ncb plating system led 

 

 

 

 

trauma sales which were offset by weaker sales of our intramedullary fixation systems the dynesys dynamic stabilization system and the optima tm5 zs spinal fixation system led spine sales osp sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products 

 

  

 

the following table presents asia pacific net sales dollars in millions 

 

 

 

changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 6 percent and hip sales by 8 percent reported decreases in average selling prices negatively affected both knee and hip sales by 4 percent the nexgen complete knee solution product line the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lpsflex knee led knee sales the gender solutions knee femoral implant also made strong contributions to knee sales for the period 

 

the continued conversion to porous stems including the fiber metal taper stem from the versys hip system the alloclassic zweymüller hip system and the cls spotorno stem led hip stem sales sales of longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners the trilogy acetabular system and trabecular metal acetabular cups also increased 

 

as a result of the disruptive factors discussed above we suffered customer losses during 2008 these customer losses negatively impacted sales growth primarily in the knee and hip product segments we expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors 

 

the biglianiflatow shoulder solution and the coonradmorrey total elbow led extremities sales the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales trauma sales were led by the itst intertrochantericsubtrochanteric fixation system the dynesys dynamic stabilization system led spine sales osp sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products 

 

  

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 758 percent in 2008 compared to 775 percent in 2007 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2007 to 2008 

 

 

 

gross margin decreased in 2008 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of yearoveryear changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses as well as an increase in excess inventory and obsolescence charges due to writeoffs related to the osp patient care product recalls and increased inventory levels as a result of lower than forecasted sales inventory stepup related to the completion of the abbott spine acquisition during 2008 also had an unfavorable impact on gross margin 

 

  

 

research and development or rd as a percentage of net sales was 47 percent for 2008 compared to 54 percent in 2007 rd decreased to 1940 million for 2008 from 2096 million in 2007 reflecting decreased spending on certain development clinical and external research activities due to delays connected with our operational compliance with the dpa and cia and implementation of our enhanced compliance and ethics initiatives we do not expect delays with our development programs in 2009 and therefore our rd expense as a percentage of revenue is expected to return to historical levels of 5 to 6 percent 

 

selling general and administrative or sga as a percentage of net sales was 413 percent for 2008 compared to 382 percent in 2007 sga expense increased to 17023 million for 2008 from 14897 million in 2007 increased sga costs include monitor fees as well as consulting and legal fees associated with the global implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives expenses related to other operating initiatives also caused an increase in sga as a percentage of net sales such operating initiatives include the planned implementation of a global it system and improving quality systems at our dover facility additionally selling costs increased as a result of the orthosoft acquisition an increase in the headcount of our sales force in certain locations increased commission incentives to sell certain key products and a change in the mix of commissions earned as a result of lower osp sales 

 

settlement expense of 1695 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons

certain claims expense of 690 million is a provision for estimated claims from durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified periods acquisition integration and other expenses increased to 685 million for 2008 compared to 252 million in 2007 the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2008 include 385 million for inprocess research and development related to the abbott spine acquisition costs related to the integration of abbott spine facility consolidation costs legal fees and retention and termination payments partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired companies the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect inprocess research and development writeoffs related to acquisitions costs related to the integration of acquired us distributors estimated settlements for certain preacquisition product liability claims integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems 

 

  

 

operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to 10900 million from 11276 million in 2007 operating profit for 2007 includes the effect of the nonrecurring settlement expense of 1695 million excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007 operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins significant but temporary increases in sga costs attributable to the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and certain claims expense of 690 million 

 

interest and other income for 2008 increased to 318 million from 40 million in 2007 interest and other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of 388 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of an increase in outstanding longterm debt 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest decreased to 243 percent for 2008 down from 316 percent in 2007 the effective tax rate for the 2007 period reflects the effect of the 1695 million settlement expense for which no tax benefit had previously been recognized during 2008 we recorded a current tax benefit of 317 million related to the settlement expense resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent to the current period effective tax rate the effective tax rate for 2008 was further reduced as a result of increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions these decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by abbott spine acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded 

 

net earnings increased 10 percent to 8486 million for 2008 compared to 7732 million in 2007 as the decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14 percent to 373 and 372 respectively from 328 and 326 in 2007 the higher growth rate in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and 2007 share repurchases

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 775 percent in 2007 compared to 777 percent in 2006 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2006 to 2007 

 

 

 

the unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as favorable geographic sales mix these gains were further offset by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines 

 

  

 

rd as a percentage of net sales was 54 percent for 2007 which is unchanged from 2006 rd increased to 2096 million for 2007 from 1883 million in 2006 reflecting increased spending on new product development across all of our product segments in 2007 we continued to make investments in our research and development facilities in warsaw indiana we continued working with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies including soft tissue biological repair and replacement 

 

sga as a percentage of net sales was 382 percent for 2007 compared to 388 percent in 2006 the improvement in sga as a percent of net sales from the prior year is due to sales growth and well controlled spending 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement expense of 1695 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons acquisition integration and other items for 2007 were 252 million compared to 61 million in 2006 the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect inprocess research and development writeoffs related to acquisitions costs related to the integration of acquired us distributors estimated settlements for certain preacquisition product liability claims integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included 277 million of income related to three unrelated matters — the sale of the former centerpulse austin land and facilities for a gain of 51 million and the favorable settlement of two preacquisition contingent liabilities 

 

  

 

operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to 11276 million from 11652 million in 2006 the decrease is due principally to the 1695 million settlement expense without the settlement expense operating profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales and controlled operating expenses 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest increased to 316 percent for 2007 up from 286 percent in 2006 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the 1695 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax benefit was recognized without the effect of the settlement expense the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions 

 

net earnings decreased 7 percent to 7732 million for 2007 compared to 8345 million in 2006 the decrease was due to the 1695 million settlement expense and the higher effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to 328 and 326 respectively from 343 and 340 in 2006 due to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase program 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 10381 million in 2008 compared to 10844 million in 2007 the principal source of cash was net earnings of 8486 million noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 3537 million of operating cash income taxrelated balances decreased by 773 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the impact of accelerated tax payments resulting from changes in federal and state tax rules all other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of 869 million of cash pertaining to pension funding and to investments in working capital in support of sales services operating cash flows continued to be positively affected by delayed payments related to various contractual arrangements with healthcare professionals or institutions for 2008 we estimate this delay had a positive effect on operating cash flows of approximately 26 million 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 59 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable an increase of 7 days when compared to december 31 2007 reflecting a change in geographic mix of outstanding accounts receivable balances and a general weakening in the broader economy at december 31 2008 we had 344 days of inventory on hand above december 31 2007 by 86 days reflecting a planned increase in fieldbased inventory deployments in the us a buildout of our inventory pipeline for certain new products we are preparing to launch in 2009 lower than expected sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency hedge gainslosses impacting cost of goods sold 

 

cash flows used in investing activities were 9242 million in 2008 compared to 4915 million in 2007 the most significant contributors to the increase in cash flows used in investing activities were the acquisition of abbott spine and the acquisition of intellectual property rights cash payments related to the acquisition of abbott spine were 3630 million compared to total acquisitionrelated payments of 1603 million in 2007 which related primarily to the acquisitions of endius and orthosoft acquired intellectual property rights of 1094 million relate to lumpsum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of an existing contractual arrangement these lumpsum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangement in 2009 we anticipate making additional lumpsum payments to acquire intellectual property rights additions to instruments during 2008 were 2379 million compared to 1385 million in 2007 additions to instruments increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in instrument deployments to permit our sales and distribution networks to respond more rapidly to changes in surgical demand patterns and capitalize on new business opportunities in 2009 we expect to spend approximately 160 — 170 million on instruments to support new products and sales additions to other property plant and equipment during 2008 were 2500 million compared to 1927 million in 2007 this increase reflects spending on planned infrastructure improvements such as opening a new manufacturing facility in ireland improving our quality system infrastructure and investing in a central distribution center for our europe segment during 2009 we expect to purchase approximately 230 — 240 million in other property plant and equipment reflecting the cash necessary to complete capital expansions initiated in 2008 as well as new productrelated investments and normal replacement of older machinery and equipment also included in investing activities for 2008 is 549 million in proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities 

 

cash flows used in financing activities were 3435 million for 2008 compared to 3995 million in 2007 we repurchased 7370 million of our common stock in 2008 as compared with 5763 million in 2007 under our stock 

 

 

 

 

repurchase programs we utilized cash generated from operating activities 570 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and borrowings under credit facilities to fund the repurchases during 2008 we borrowed 3300 million from our existing credit facilities to fund stock repurchases and partially fund the acquisition of abbott spine 

 

we may use excess cash or further borrow from our credit facilities to repurchase additional common stock under the 125 billion program which expires december 31 2009 

 

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing november 30 2012 the “senior credit facility” we had 4601 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2008 and an availability of 8899 million the senior credit facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to 1750 million and request that the maturity date be extended for two additional oneyear periods 

 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 35 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2008 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility and a utilization fee the senior credit facility is rated a by standard  poor’s ratings services and is not rated by moody’s investors’ service inc notwithstanding recent interruptions in global credit markets as of the date of this report we believe our access to our senior credit facility has not been impaired 

 

in october 2008 we funded a portion of the acquisition of abbott spine with approximately 110 million of new borrowings under the senior credit facility each of the lenders under the senior credit facility funded its portion of the new borrowings in accordance with its commitment percentage 

 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 714 million 

 

management believes that cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

 

excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprogress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

 

income taxes  – we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions we are subject to regulatory 

 

 

 

 

review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense liabilities and reserves we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 

 

commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model during 2008 in addition to our general product liability estimates we recorded a provision for certain claims of 690 million representing management’s estimate of liability to durom cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries occurring before july 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date these parameters are consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique are most likely to occur within that time period any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals the amounts established for our general product liability estimates excluding certain claims for the durom cup equate to less than 5 percent of total liabilities and represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies 

 

goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

 

sharebased payment  – we account for sharebased payment expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

 

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars and korean won we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2008 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars and korean won or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2009 through june 2011 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 13430 million and 12446 million respectively the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 2075 million and 1384 million respectively the weighted average contract rates outstanding are eurousd 141 usdswiss franc 110 usdjapanese yen 101 british poundusd 186 usdcanadian dollar 109 australian dollarusd 082 and usdkorean won 1000 

 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2008 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2011 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 723 million 211 million 324 million 104 million 71 million 72 million and 19 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

 

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 2003 million at december 31 2008 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1234 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2008 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency remeasurement gainslosses recognized in earnings under sfas no 52 “foreign currency translation” are generally offset with gainslosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

 

presently we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in us government treasury funds and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities presently all of our debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure but we may do so in the future based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2008 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

 

we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 

 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

 

concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk 

 

 

 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of zimmer holdings inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

overview 

 

we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products we also provide other healthcare related services in this report “zimmer” “we” “us” “our” and similar words refer collectively to zimmer holdings inc and its subsidiaries zimmer holdings refers to the parent company only 

 

there were several developments in 2007 that we expect will have a significant impact on our business for the foreseeable future 

 

in april 2007 we acquired endius incorporated a privately held spinal products company based in massachusetts endius develops and manufactures minimally invasive spine surgery products implants and techniques to treat spine disease the acquisition of endius has expanded our spine product portfolio to include innovative minimally invasive instruments and implants 

 

in may 2007 the board of directors promoted two of our senior executives to the offices of chief executive officer and chief financial officer this is the first time since we became an independent public company that new persons are holding those offices 

 

in september 2007 we and other major us orthopaedic manufacturers announced a settlement reached with the us department of justice regarding its ongoing investigation of financial relationships with consulting surgeons as part of that settlement we paid a 1695 million civil settlement amount in the third quarter and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” and a corporate integrity agreement “cia” as part of these agreements we agreed to oversight by a federal monitor for 18 months and an independent review organization for an additional 42 months we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the dpa and cia as recently announced we intend to further expand our compliance program beyond the requirements of these agreements to enhance our ability to compete in an increasingly transparent and regulated environment 

 

in november 2007 we acquired orthosoft inc a leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery the orthosoft acquisition bolsters our zimmer smarttools strategic initiative designed to bring innovative tools to the marketplace that will help create better and more reproducible outcomes for surgeons and patients 

 

we anticipate further applying both minimally invasive and computer navigation concepts across our range of businesses during 2007 we expanded our gender solutions ® platform to additional knee replacement systems and to hip replacement we have also announced our intention to make additional investments in the higher growth areas of spine and dental products 

 

finally beginning in 2007 under the direction of our new senior executives we undertook an extensive review of our operations and identified a number of planned improvements we subsequently announced in 2008 these include developing a new manufacturing facility in ireland upgrading our sales and distribution capabilities in the us enhancing our information technology and quality systems and investing in our spine dental and trauma business units 

 

zimmer holdings was incorporated in delaware in 2001 our history dates to 1927 when zimmer manufacturing company a predecessor was founded in warsaw indiana on august 6 2001 zimmer holdings was spun off from its former parent and became an independent public company

our primary customers include musculoskeletal surgeons neurosurgeons oral surgeons dentists hospitals distributors healthcare dealers and in their capacity as agents healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups these customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent surgeons 

 

we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries with corporate headquarters in warsaw indiana and more than 100 manufacturing distribution and warehousing andor office facilities worldwide we manage our operations through three major geographic segments – the americas which is comprised principally of the united states and includes other north central and south american markets europe which is comprised principally of europe and includes the middle east and africa and asia pacific which is comprised primarily of japan and includes other asian and pacific markets 

 

we market and sell products through three principal channels 1 direct to healthcare institutions such as hospitals or direct channel accounts 2 through stocking distributors and in the asia pacific region healthcare dealers and 3 directly to dental practices and dental laboratories with direct channel accounts inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers with sales to stocking distributors healthcare dealers dental practices and dental laboratories title to product passes generally upon shipment direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2007 no individual direct channel account stocking distributor healthcare dealer dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2007 

 

we stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors including demand manufacturing lead times and 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

quantities required to maintain service levels we also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices 

 

we utilize a network of sales associates sales managers and support personnel most of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies we invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons 

 

in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region we utilize a global approach to sales force training marketing and medical education to provide consistent high quality service additionally we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to musculoskeletal surgeons and the medical procedures they perform 

 

americas the americas is our largest geographic segment accounting for 22770 million or 58 percent of 2007 net sales with the united states accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region the united states sales force consists primarily of independent sales agents most of whom sell products exclusively for zimmer sales agents in the united states receive a commission on product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions and costs sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale 

 

in this region we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group at negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period price discounts increase generally we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products although members are not obligated to purchase our products contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years with extensions as warranted 

 

a majority of hospitals in the united states belong to at least one group purchasing organization in 2007 individual hospital orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our three largest group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately 48 percent of our net sales in the united states contractual sales were highest through novation llc premier purchasing partners lp and health trust purchasing group representing 27 percent 15 percent and 6 percent respectively of net sales in the united states no individual enduser however accounted for over 1 percent of our net sales and the top ten endusers accounted for approximately 4 percent of our aggregate net sales in the united states 

 

in the americas we monitor and rank independent sales agents across a range of performance metrics we evaluate independent sales agents based on achieving certain sales targets and on maintaining efficient levels of working capital we set expectations for efficient management of inventory and provide independent sales agents an incentive to aid in the collection of receivables

orthopaedic reconstructive implants 

 

  

 

in 2007 we continued to expand our efforts to apply minimally invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery which we refer to as minimally invasive solutions tm mis procedures and technologies the principal goals of these mis technology efforts are to reduce the hardships of having a total joint replacement such as the time a patient must spend in recovery pain reduction and lost time from work we have used the zimmer institute to facilitate the training of over 7900 surgeons on several mis procedures in 2007 we trained nearly 1700 surgeons through the zimmer institute we intend to continue to conduct validated objectivebased medical education that is designed to ensure surgical skill development in the safe and effective use of zimmer products and procedures 

 

we continue to work with surgeons to evaluate and refine our mis procedures as refinements occur they are incorporated into our course curriculum we are focused on commercializing existing mis technique approaches and investigating new ways to apply mis technology principles to additional procedures and products 

 

  

 

total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articular surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime or primary joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining cr designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized ps and ultracongruent uc designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis 

 

our portfolio of mis techniques includes the mis miniincision total knee procedure the mis miniincision total knee instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues 

 

we offer a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including the following 

 

nexgen ® complete knee solution  the nexgen knee product line is a comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had significant application in ps cr and revision procedures the nexgen knee system offers joint stability and sizing that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components the nexgen knee system provides surgeons with complete and versatile knee instrument options including mis miniincision instruments milling and multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument systems the breadth and versatility of the nexgen knee system allows surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during surgery according to the needs of the patient and to support current surgical philosophies 

 

the nexgen complete knee solution legacy ® kneeposterior stabilized product line provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate ligament the ps capabilities were augmented through the introduction of the nexgen legacy posterior stabilized flex knee the “lpsflex knee” a highflexion implant that has the potential to accommodate knee flexion up to a 155degree range of motion in some patients 

 

the nexgen cr product line is designed to be used in conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament the nexgen crflex fixed bearing knee is designed with components to provide a greater range of motion for patients who require deep bending in their daily activities the nexgen crflex femoral components allow the surgeon to adjust component sizing without removing additional bone 

 

the nexgen revision knee product line consists of several different products that are designed to provide clinical solutions to surgeons for various revision situations including a bone augmentation implant system made from our trabecular metal tm technology material these augments are designed to address significant bone loss in revision surgery

orthobiologics 

 

our research and development efforts include an orthobiologics group based in austin texas with its own fulltime staff and dedicated projects centralizing our efforts on the development of technologies for orthopaedic applications including the repair and replacement of damaged tendon ligament meniscus cartilage bone and spinal nucleus tissues this group works on biological solutions to repair and regenerate damaged or degenerated musculoskeletal tissues using biomaterials which offer the possibility of treating damaged joints by biological repair rather than replacing them with inert materials a sampling of some of our key projects in the orthobiologics area is set forth below 

 

we are collaborating with isto technologies inc isto to develop chondral and osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair isto is developing cellbased therapies for cartilage regeneration using cells from juvenile donor cartilage with initial applications focused upon knee joints neocartilage is a living tissueengineered cartilage graft under investigation for the restoration of cartilage defects reestablishment of joint function and relief of pain in the knee the phase i clinical trial ind for neocartilage has completed patient enrollment with some patients having reached the 12month followup milestone we plan to distribute this product as denovo ® et engineered tissue graft in addition we launched the first zimmer cartilage repair product  denovo ® nt natural tissue graft in 2007 this product provides juvenile cartilage tissue pieces for repair of cartilage defects in a variety of anatomical sites including knee hip shoulder and ankle 

 

many orthopaedic surgical procedures use bone grafts to help regenerate lost or damaged bone as noted above our spine and trauma divisions introduced a technologicallyadvanced synthetic bone graft material copios bone void filler in a paste formulation this synthetic material has similarities to human cancellous bone and is used to fill bone voids or defects it can be soaked in an individual’s own bone marrow to localize biologic components necessary for bone growth to aid in healing it is then placed into the bone void where it is completely replaced by natural bone during the healing process 

 

research and development 

 

we have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques materials orthobiologics and product designs the research and development functions work closely with our strategic brand marketing function the rapid commercialization of innovative new materials orthobiologics products implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth 

 

among our product launches in 2007 we released the following by business segment 

  

not available for commercial distribution in the united states 

 

other new product surgical technique and instrument introductions in the orthopaedic reconstructive implants spine implants trauma orthopaedic surgical products and orthobiologics product categories are more fully described above under the captions “products” and “orthobiologics” these and other new products introduced in the last three years accounted for approximately 25 percent of 2007 total sales 

 

we are broadening our product offerings in each of the product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we spent 2096 million 1883 million and 1755 million respectively on research and development the increased research and development expenditures have accelerated the output of new orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants spine and trauma products including advanced new materials product designs and surgical techniques our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana in 2007 we completed our research and development facility expansion project in warsaw we have other research and development personnel based in among other places winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2007 we employed more than 700 research and development employees worldwide 

 

we will continue to identify innovative technologies and consider acquiring complementary products or businesses or establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

 

government regulation of our operations 

 

we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business in the united states numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market these include among 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the us food and drug administration fda has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development manufacture advertising promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products including medical devices in addition the fda controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public 

 

most of our new products fall into fda classifications that require the submission of a premarket notification 510k to the fda this process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as that is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device we must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims before we can market the new device we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the united states other devices we develop and market are in a category class for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval pma requirements the pma process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses all of our devices marketed in the united states have been cleared or approved by the fda with the exception of certain preamendment devices which were in commercial distribution prior to may 28 1976 the fda has grandfathered these devices so new fda submissions are not required some low risk medical devices including most instruments also do not require fda review and approval or clearance prior to commercial distribution the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement of or refund the costs of such devices there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries compliance with the medical device directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a ce mark on its products to obtain authorization to affix the ce mark to a product a recognized european notified body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by the notified bodies for compliance with these requirements 

 

further we are subject to various federal and state laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws these laws are administered by among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services and state attorneys general many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years in 2007 we and other major us orthopaedic manufacturers settled alleged violations of the federal antikickback statute with the us department of justice as part of this settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and a corporate integrity agreement and paid a civil settlement amount see “item 1a — risk factors — risks related to our business” for more information about our obligations under these agreements we are continuing to enhance our corporate compliance program and are applying these enhancements to all of our businesses on a global basis we are monitoring our practices on an ongoing basis to better ensure that we have proper controls in place to comply with the laws referenced above violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs 

 

our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings capital expenditures or competitive position 

 

competition 

 

the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and orthopaedic surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc synthes inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and tornier inc 

 

in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

 

in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc and smith  nephew plc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

 

the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including mathys ag and waldemar link gmbh  co kg which compete with us in addition to the global competitors today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for europe although global products are gaining acceptance therefore we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

 

in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp now operating as biomet trauma and biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc 

 

competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation and customer service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies where possible we will continue to seek patent trademark and other intellectual property protection concerning the surgical techniques materials technologies and products we design and develop 

 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

we manufacture substantially all of our products at eight locations including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey and etupes france in february 2008 we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in shannon ireland 

 

we believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry standards in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational improvement in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained 

 

we generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at levels up to 90 percent of total capacity we continually evaluate the potential to insource products currently purchased from outside vendors to onsite production 

 

improving manufacturing process capability and productivity have been major contributors to improvement in profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs major areas of improvement have included utilization of computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automation of certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls stateoftheart equipment purchases and upgrades insourcing of core products such as castings and forgings highspeed machining and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 

 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

 

employees 

 

we employ more than 7600 employees worldwide including more than 700 employees dedicated to research and development nearly 4700 employees are located within the united states and approximately 2900 employees are located outside of the united states primarily throughout europe and in japan we have over 3300 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs more than 1500 employees fewer than 200 north american employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

in may 2007 we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union for and on behalf of local 273715 covering employees at the dover ohio facility which continues in effect until may 15 2012

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

risks related to our business 

 

if we fail to comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement and corporate integrity agreement we entered into in september 2007 we may be subject to criminal prosecution andor exclusion from federal healthcare programs 

 

as previously reported on september 27 2007 we settled an investigation conducted by the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey the “us attorney” into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons as part of that settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement the “dpa” with the us attorney and a corporate integrity agreement the “cia” with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the “oighhs” copies of the dpa and cia are filed as exhibits to this report and a copy of the dpa is available on our website at wwwzimmercom 

 

the dpa has a term of 18 months and provides for oversight by a federally appointed monitor if we breach the dpa we could be subject to prosecution for violations of the federal antikickback statute that the us attorney alleges we committed between 2002 and 2006 as well as any new or continuing violations we could also be subject to exclusion by oighhs from participation in federal healthcare programs including medicaid and medicare any of these consequences would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

the cia requires us to continue our corporate compliance program and to adhere to certain other provisions including reporting requirements we also agreed to retain an independent review organization to perform annual reviews to assist us in assessing our compliance with the cia to ensure that arrangements we enter into do not violate the federal antikickback statute if we breach the cia the oighhs may take further action against us up to and including excluding us from participation in federal healthcare programs which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our recent settlement with the department of justice and oighhs could lead to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

 

as a result of the publicity surrounding our recent settlement with the department of justice and oighhs including the allegations of wrongdoing made by the us attorney other governmental agencies including state authorities could conduct investigations or institute proceedings that are not precluded by terms of that settlement as previously disclosed the us securities and exchange commission has commenced an informal investigation into sales by us and other companies of medical devices in foreign countries we are also cooperating with an investigative demand made by one state attorney general while we believe that the pending state investigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition similar investigations by other states or governmental agencies are possible in addition in january 2008 we received a written request from the united states senate special committee on aging “committee” seeking among other things additional information regarding the financial relationships we publicly disclosed pursuant to the dpa we responded to this request in writing and through testimony before the committee in february 2008 also as previously reported two shareholder derivative actions were filed purportedly on our behalf against current and two former directors relating to oversight of the conduct that lead to the settlement with the us attorney in addition the settlement with the us attorney could increase our exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers under the federal false claims acts based on new theories or allegations arising from the allegations made by the us attorney we intend to review and take appropriate actions with respect to any such investigations or proceedings however we cannot assure that 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

the costs of defending or resolving those investigations or proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

if we are not able to fulfill or otherwise resolve our existing royalty and other payment obligations to consulting surgeons and institutions our ability to maintain our existing intellectual property rights and obtain future rights may be impaired 

 

we are reviewing agreements we have entered into with consulting surgeons and institutions and assessing whether we can fulfill our obligations under these agreements in view of the dpa if we do not perform those obligations or reach some other resolution acceptable to the affected consulting surgeons and institutions our ability to use the intellectual property covered by those agreements may be adversely affected in addition our ability to enter into new agreements with consulting surgeons or institutions for the future development of intellectual property rights may be adversely affected 

 

our ongoing efforts to enhance our corporate compliance program globally will require cooperation by many employees and others and may divert substantial financial and human resources from our other business activities 

 

we are committed to devoting sufficient resources to meet our obligations under the dpa and cia we have also announced our intention to further enhance our corporate compliance program and to expand those enhancements into all of our businesses on a global basis successful implementation of this enhanced program will require the full cooperation of our employees distributors and sales agents and the healthcare professionals with whom they interact these efforts not only involve expense but also require management and other key employees to focus extensively on these matters preventing them from devoting as much time as they otherwise would to other business matters 

 

in addition if our competitors do not make similar enhancements to their compliance programs this may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if some of the business practices of our independent sales agents and distributors are challenged as unlawful they may have to change these practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

 

demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

  

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

  

in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

  

moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

 

we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

 

because we sell our products in more than 100 countries our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally in 2007 we derived approximately 17572 million or 45 of our total revenue from sales of our products outside of the united states we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

violations stemming from any of the above identified risks could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

 

we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

 

a substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in europe and japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative financial instruments we enter into are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions the forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 

 

we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

 

our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents in the united states patent applications are confidential for 18 months following their filing and because third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications our patent applications may not have priority over patent applications of others in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage if a third party initiates litigation regarding our patents our collaborators’ patents or those patents for which we have license rights and is successful a court could declare our patents invalid or unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents 

 

the united states patent and trademark office uspto and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more broadly the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and the risk of infringement litigation will likely increase on the other hand if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more narrowly the value of our proprietary rights may be reduced any changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

 

in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors may also capture market share from us by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which would limit our growth and future revenue 

 

we also rely upon trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive we attempt to protect this information with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators these individuals may breach these agreements and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages furthermore our trade secrets knowhow and other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors 

 

we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

 

a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements however we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing selling or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may complete additional acquisitions which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

 

we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our businesses acquisition involves risk including the following 

  

if we are unable to form strategic alliances or if our strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives our operating results will be negatively impacted 

 

we have entered into strategic alliances with other orthopaedic and biotechnology companies these include our collaboration with isto technologies inc relating to regenerative cartilage technology and our distribution agreement with heraeus relating to orthopaedic bone cement products the success of these and similar arrangements is largely dependent on technology and other intellectual property contributed by our strategic partners or the resources efforts and skills of these partners disputes and difficulties in such relationships are common often due to conflicting priorities merger and acquisition activity may exacerbate these issues the benefits of these alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners 

  

furthermore under some of our strategic alliances we may make milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these payments we also may make equity investments in our strategic partners these investments may decline in value and result in our incurring financial statement charges in the future 

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

 

we use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our future profitability may be affected by changes to our product category and region sales mix 

 

reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit margins among our product categories these products accounted for approximately 84 of 2007 net sales sales in our americas region accounted for approximately 58 of 2007 net sales sales in the americas region produce the highest operating profit margins in the geographic markets in which we operate while we expect net sales of reconstructive implants and net sales in the americas region to remain strong changes to our product category mix or our region sales mix could adversely affect our future profitability 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

the ongoing informal investigation by the united states securities and exchange commission regarding potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are cooperating fully with the securities and exchange commission with regard to an ongoing informal investigation of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees stockholders acting on their behalf and agents from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and this law requires companies to maintain records which fairly and accurately reflect transactions and to maintain internal accounting controls in many countries hospitals and clinics are governmentowned and healthcare professionals employed by such hospitals and clinics with whom we regularly interact meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the foreign corrupt practices act although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we conduct training in this area there

can be no assurance that violations of these requirements do not occur in connection with sales of our medical devices if we are found to have violated the foreign corrupt practices act we may face sanctions including fines criminal penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

 

our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws the federal antikickback statute similar state laws and physician selfreferral laws we settled alleged violations of the federal antikickback statute in september 2007 but we remain subject to these laws on an ongoing basis violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and veterans administration va health programs the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change we are continuing to enhance our corporate compliance program and monitoring our practices on an ongoing basis to better ensure that we have proper controls in place to comply with these laws 

 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

 

we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other healthcare providers all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

 

in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services for example managed care programs often prescribe only those orthopaedic recovery products that match a patient as to age need for mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide more costeffective care if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

in international markets where the movement toward healthcare reform and the development of managed care are generally not as advanced as in the united states we have experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in japan for example a governmentoperated insurance system reimburses customers for our products under this system the japanese government periodically reviews and reduces the reimbursement levels for products if the japanese government continues to reduce the reimbursement level for orthopaedic products our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the ongoing costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

 

our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

 

we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including orthobiological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies 

 

in the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants trauma products and other orthopaedic products a limited number of competitors including depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc wright medical group inc synthes inc and smith  nephew plc compete with us for the majority of product sales in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp a subsidiary of biomet inc in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc competition is primarily on the basis of

in markets outside of the united states other factors influence competition as well including 

  

our competitors may 

  

any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

 

the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

 

in addition if we fail to comply with applicable fda medical device or other material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations that failure could result in among other things 

  

any of these actions in combination or alone could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things 

  

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries such as the european medical devices directive are similar to those of the fda in addition in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as both the fda and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business will be harmed 

 

we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

 

our business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings in addition some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

 

as part of our risk management policy we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage however product liability claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies may have substantial retentions or deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of those retentions or deductibles we will be responsible for paying any losses that are below those retentions or deductibles a product liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as “osp” we also provide other healthcare related services reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and postoperation rehabilitation we have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments — the americas europe and asia pacific 

 

certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes certain amounts in the 2006 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation 

 

we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

demand volume and mix trends 

 

 

increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 9 percentage points of 2007 sales growth which is 2 percentage points above the rate of growth from 2006 compared to 2005 we believe orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis will continue to rise at mid single digit rates driven by an aging global population obesity and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the continued shift in demand to premium products such as longevity  durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products highflex knees knee revision products and porous hip stems continue to positively affect sales growth for example during 2007 sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over 210 million a yearoveryear increase of over 26 percent 

 

we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry in 2007 we acquired orthosoft inc a market leader in surgical navigation in orthopaedics combined with our smarttools strategic initiative we are focused on becoming a leader in operating room efficiency and enhancing surgical outcomes through the use of innovative navigation devices and cutting tools we continued our significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants procedures and technologies during the year ended december 31 2007 the zimmer institute trained nearly 1700 surgeons on advanced techniques including approximately 850 surgeons on mis procedures 

 

we believe innovative products will continue to affect the orthopaedics industry in the second half of 2006 we launched the zimmer gender solutions highflex knee femoral implant high flex knees now make up approximately 44 percent of our total femoral unit sales on a global basis having grown from approximately 28 percent prior to the launch of the zimmer gender solutions knee 

 

pricing trends 

 

 

selling prices were flat during 2007 compared to a modest increase during 2006 when compared to 2005 asia pacific selling prices decreased 1 percentage point for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to a 2 percent decrease in 2006 when compared to 2005 as anticipated the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates during 2007 this action affected sales in japan negatively by approximately 5 percent for 2007 while other asia pacific markets were flat to positive japan represents approximately 7 percent of our sales the americas experienced a 1 percent increase in selling prices during 2007 compared to a 2 percent increase in 2006 in europe selling prices for 2007 decreased 1 percent the same decrease we saw in 2006 as compared to 2005 within europe germany and italy reported decreases in average selling prices of 4 percent and 2 percent respectively in 2007 as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates and group purchasing arrangements while most other european markets were positive to flat germany and italy combined represent approximately 11 percent of our sales with the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing organizations global selling prices are expected to remain flat in 2008 

 

foreign currency exchange rates 

 

 

for 2007 foreign currency exchange rates had a positive 3 percent effect on global sales growth if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2008 of approximately 2 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts which are 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

 

new product sales 

 

 

new products which we define as products or stock keeping units “sku’s” introduced within the prior 36month period to a particular market accounted for 25 percent or 961 million of 2007 sales adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of performance in our industry our sales have grown with the introduction of new products such as trabecular metal modular acetabular cups certain sku’s of the nexgen complete knee solution including the gender solutions knee femoral implant for the lpsflex and crflex knees the dynesys 4 dynamic stabilization system the zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis and palacos 5 bone cement 

 

we believe new products in our current pipeline should continue to favorably affect our operating performance products we expect to contribute to new product sales in 2008 include the gender solutions knee femoral implant gender solutions naturalknee flex system products incorporating trabecular metal technology including the trabecular metal primary hip prosthesis trabecular metal acetabular revision system and trabecular metal spine implants zimmer ml taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology durom acetabular cups with metasul ldh large diameter heads versys epoch composite hip prosthesis zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system anatomical shoulder inversereverse system zimmer mis femoral nailing solutions ncb locking plate system and copios bone void filler 6  

 

acquisitions 

 

 

in april 2007 we acquired endius incorporated a privately held spinal products company for an aggregate value of approximately 80 million in cash before adjustments for debt repayment and other items 

 

in november 2007 we acquired orthosoft inc a leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery in a cash transaction for an aggregate value of approximately 50 million 

 

settlement of department of justice investigation 

 

 

on september 27 2007 we and other major us orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with the united states government to resolve all claims related to an ongoing investigation into financial relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons as part of the settlement we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey under the provisions of the deferred prosecution agreement we are subject to oversight by a federal monitor selected by the us attorney for a period of 18 months we expect to continue to incur costs of approximately 69 million per quarter to comply with the deferred prosecution agreement through the remainder of the 18 month period 

 

we settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the united states government of 1695 million we recorded a 1695 million expense during the third quarter in connection with the settlement 

 

we also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services which has a term of 5 years for more information regarding the settlement see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

 

on january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 

 

prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impacts of these expected settlements of 1021 million as well as a separate accrued interest liability of 17 million as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we are required to present the different components of such liability gross versus the historical net presentation the adoption resulted in the tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by 64 million as of january 1 2007 

 

this decrease in the tax liability resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of 48 million a reduction in goodwill of 614 million the establishment of a tax receivable of 582 million and the addition of an interestpenalty payable of 79 million all as of january 1 2007 

 

2008 outlook 

 

 

our operating profit for 2008 will be affected by the costs we will incur to implement a number of recently announced initiatives that we believe will position us to respond better to the changing needs of the healthcare market additionally during 2008 we expect to incur costs of approximately 69 million per quarter to comply with the deferred prosecution

the nexgen complete knee solution product line including the gender solutions knee femoral implants nexgen lpsflex knee nexgen trabecular metal tibial components the nexgen lcck revision knee and the nexgen crflex knee led knee sales the zimmer unicompartmental highflex knee also made a strong contribution 

 

growth in porous stems including growth of the zimmer ml taper stem and trabecular metal primary hip prosthesis led hip stem sales but were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems palacos bone cement trabecular metal acetabular cups and durom acetabular cups with metasul ldh large diameter heads also exhibited strong growth bone cement sales growth accounted for 2 percent of the 2007 hip sales growth over prior year as noted above we expect that the adoption of hip resurfacing in the us market will adversely affect our hip sales growth in the near term 

 

the biglianiflatow shoulder solution and the trabecular metal humeral stem led extremities sales the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales zimmer periarticular plates and zimmer plates and screws led trauma sales but were offset by declining sales of intramedullary nails and compression hip screws the dynesys dynamic stabilization system the trinica select anterior cervical plate system and spinal trabecular metal implants led spine sales extremity surgical products led osp sales 

 

  

 

the following table presents europe net sales dollars in millions 

 

 

 

changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 9 percent and hip sales by 8 percent excluding these foreign exchange rate effects the following product categories experienced positive sales growth in our europe region the nexgen complete knee solution product line including the nexgen lpsflex knee nexgen trabecular metal tibial components the nexgen crflex knee and the innex total knee system growth in porous stems including the cls spotorno stem led hip stem sales longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners the durom hip resurfacing system trabecular metal acetabular cups and the allofit hip acetabular system also contributed to hip sales 

 

the anatomical shoulder system the anatomical shoulder inversereverse system and the coonradmorrey total elbow led extremities sales the addition of a direct sales force in italy as a result of a distributor acquisition contributed to growth in dental sales and the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales the cableready ® cable grip system zimmer periarticular plates and the ncb plating system led trauma sales which were offset by weaker sales of our intramedullary fixation systems the dynesys dynamic stabilization system and trabecular metal implants led spine sales wound management products led osp sales

changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 5 percent and positively affected hip sales by 2 percent reported decreases in average selling prices negatively affected hip sales by 3 percent the nexgen complete knee solution product line including nexgen trabecular metal tibial components the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lpsflex knee led knee sales launch of the gender solutions knee femoral implant in australia also contributed to strong knee sales for the year the continued conversion to porous stems including the fiber metal taper stem from the versys hip system the alloclassic zweymüller hip system and the cls spotorno stem led hip stem sales sales of longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and trabecular metal acetabular cups also exhibited growth 

 

extremities sales increased due to stronger sales of our shoulder and elbow products the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales trauma sales were led by strong growth in zimmer periarticular plates and zimmer plates and screws but were partially offset by a reported 5 percent decrease in average selling prices during 2007 a registration issue with the st360 ® spinal fixation system in japan resulted in a decrease in sales of this device contributing to the negative growth in spine sales for 2007 powered surgical instruments led osp sales 

 

  

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 775 percent in 2007 compared to 777 percent in 2006 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2006 to 2007 

 

 

 

the unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as favorable geographic sales mix these gains were further offset by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines 

 

  

 

research and development or rd as a percentage of net sales was 54 percent for 2007 which is unchanged from 2006 rd increased to 2096 million for 2007 from 1883 million in 2006 reflecting increased spending on new product development across all of our product segments in 2007 we continued to make investments in our research and development facilities in warsaw indiana we continued working with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies including soft tissue biological repair and replacement new products which we define as those introduced into a market in the preceding thirtysix months accounted for approximately 25 percent of net sales in 2007 compared with 24 percent in 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2007 we announced fda approval of the zimmer nexgen lpsflex mobile knee additionally in the second half of 2007 we launched several new products including the gender solutions naturalknee flex system and the zimmer ml taper prosthesis with kinectiv technology we continue to target our rd spending at the high end of what we believe to be an industry average of 46 percent 

 

selling general and administrative or sga as a percentage of net sales was 382 percent for 2007 compared to 388 percent in 2006 the improvement in sga as a percent of net sales from the prior year is due to sales growth and well controlled spending 

 

settlement expense of 1695 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons acquisition integration and other items for 2007 were 252 million compared to 61 million in 2006 the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect inprocess research and development writeoffs related to acquisitions costs related to the integration of acquired us distributors estimated settlements for certain preacquisition product liability claims integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems the acquisition integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included 277 million of income related to three unrelated matters – the sale of the former centerpulse austin land and facilities for a gain of 51 million and the favorable settlement of two preacquisition contingent liabilities 

 

  

 

operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to 11276 million from 11652 million in 2006 the decrease is due principally to the 1695 million settlement expense without the settlement expense operating profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales and controlled operating expenses 

 

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest increased to 316 percent for 2007 up from 286 percent in 2006 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the 1695 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax benefit has been 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

recognized without the effect of the settlement expense the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions 

 

net earnings decreased 7 percent to 7732 million for 2007 compared to 8345 million in 2006 the decrease was due to the 1695 million settlement expense and the higher effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to 328 and 326 respectively from 343 and 340 in 2006 due to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase program

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 777 percent in 2006 compared to 775 percent in 2005 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2005 to 2006 

 

 

 

higher average selling prices in our largest operating segment offset by lower prices in europe and asia pacific contributed to the modest improvement in gross margin other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were the net favorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses and manufacturing productivity gains offset by underlying exposure gains and losses increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines and increased royalty expenses as a percentage of sales due to a higher mix of royalty bearing sales 

 

  

 

research and development or rd as a percentage of net sales was 54 percent for 2006 compared to 53 percent in 2005 rd increased to 1883 million for 2006 from 1755 million in 2005 reflecting increased spending on projects focused on our redefined corporate strategies

the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest decreased to 286 percent for 2006 down from 295 percent in 2005 the reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions including puerto rico 

 

net earnings increased 14 percent to 8345 million for 2006 compared to 7325 million in 2005 the increase was due to higher operating profit lower acquisition integration and other expenses decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower effective tax rate offset by 545 million of sharebased compensation expense net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent to 343 and 340 respectively from 296 and 293 in 2005

asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to improved gross margins gross margins increased throughout many asia pacific markets including japan despite decreases in average selling prices in japan as a result of reductions in government controlled reimbursement prices the improvement in gross margins in asia pacific is due to favorable product sales mix and lower unit manufacturing costs

we continue to focus on working capital management at december 31 2007 we had 52 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable a decrease of 3 days when compared to december 31 2006 the improvement was achieved through improvement in all reporting segments at december 31 2007 we had 258 days of inventory on hand favorable to december 31 2006 by 19 days this decrease reflects higher cost of goods sold and strong underlying demand in the fourth quarter of 2007 our inventory levels have improved from a third quarter high of 330 days as a result of seasonal demand patterns 

 

cash flows used in investing activities were 4915 million in 2007 compared to 2870 million in 2006 the most significant contributor to the increase in cash flows used in investing activities were the payments related to the acquisitions of endius and orthosoft as well as additions to our global distributor network cash payments related to acquisitions for 2007 was 1603 million compared to 349 million in 2006 additions to instruments during 2007 were 1385 million compared to 1262 million in 2006 additions to instruments increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an increase in instrument deployments related to new product launches in 2008 we expect to spend approximately 155 – 170 million on instruments to support new products sales growth and mis procedures additions to other property plant and equipment during 2007 were 1927 million compared to 1421 million in 2006 increases were related to facility expansions in warsaw indiana ponce puerto rico and winterthur switzerland and investment in new information technology systems these facility expansions improved working conditions and capabilities for our research and development organization responded to increased demand and the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites during 2008 we expect to purchase approximately 315330 million in other property plant and equipment under our planned infrastructure improvements and international manufacturing expansion 

 

cash flows used in financing activities were 3995 million for 2007 compared to 7307 million in 2006 we repurchased 5763 million of our common stock in 2007 as compared with 7988 million in 2006 under our stock repurchase programs we utilized cash generated from operating activities and 1498 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans to fund the repurchases we may use excess cash to fund future purchases if any under our stock repurchase programs 

 

we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing november 30 2012 the “senior credit facility” we had 1043 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2007 and an availability of 12457 million the 1043 million is for use in japan and carries a low interest rate the senior credit facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to 1750 million and request that the maturity date be extended for two additional oneyear periods 

 

we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 35 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2007 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility and a utilization fee the senior credit facility is rated a by standard  poor’s ratings services and is not rated by moody’s investors’ service inc 

 

we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 704 million 

 

management believes that cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

 

excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprogress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

 

income taxes  − we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense liabilities and reserves we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 

 

commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model the amounts established equate to less than 5 percent of total liabilities and represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies 

 

goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

 

sharebased payment  – we account for sharebased payment expense in accordance with the fair value 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

recognition provisions of sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

 

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars and korean won we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

 

for contracts outstanding at december 31 2007 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars and korean won or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2008 through may 2010 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2007 and 2006 were 12446 million and 11693 million respectively the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2007 and 2006 were 1384 million and 2050 million respectively the weighted average contract rates outstanding are eurousd 134 usdswiss franc 119 usdjapanese yen 109 british poundusd 192 usdcanadian dollar 109 australian dollarusd 078 and usdkorean won 929 

 

we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2007 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2010 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 784 million 131 million 204 million 146 million 53 million 65 million and 20 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

 

we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 18691 million at december 31 2007 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1178 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2007 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency translation gainslosses recognized in earnings under sfas no 52 “foreign currency translation” are generally offset with gainlosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

 

zimmer holdings inc 2007 form 10k annual report 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

 

presently we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in us government treasury funds and bank deposits the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

 

our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities presently all of our debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2007 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

credit risk 

 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

 

we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 

 

we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

 

concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

orthopaedic reconstructive implants 

   in 2006 we continued to expand our efforts to apply minimally invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery which we refer to as minimally invasive solutions tm mis procedures and technologies the principal goals of these mis technology efforts are to reduce the hardships of having a total joint replacement such as the time a patient must spend in rehabilitation pain reduction and lost time from work we have used the zimmer institute with its main facility located at our global headquarters and satellite centers to facilitate the training of over 6200 surgeons on several mis procedures in 2006 we trained nearly 2000 surgeons through the zimmer institute network 

  we work directly with several global medical centers to evaluate and refine advanced minimally invasive knee and hip replacement procedures we have 25 existing partnerships to provide surgeon education at the zimmer institute and its satellite locations 

  we continue to work with our global network of medical centers and leading surgeons to evaluate and refine our mis procedures as refinements occur they are incorporated into our course curriculum for example in december 2006 we assembled a panel of experts in the zimmer ® mis 2incision tm total hip replacement procedure in warsaw indiana to discuss opportunities to further improve this already successful procedure 

  in the latter part of 2006 we introduced our mis anterior supine total hip replacement procedure this procedure can be performed using a traditional operating room table that decreases surgical time and capital costs and allows for more accurate assessment of leg length and joint stability 

  throughout 2006 we continued to develop navigation systems through the use of imageguided surgical technology to aid in the placement of instrumentation and implants where navigation is difficult due to the small incisions necessary in effectuating minimally invasive procedures we trained nearly 50 surgeons in the use of electromagnetic computer assisted surgeryenabled knee replacement procedures this technology continues to improve 

  we are focused on commercializing existing mis technique approaches and investigating new ways to apply mis technology principles to additional procedures and products 

   total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articular surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime or primary joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining cr designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized ps designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis 

  our portfolio of mis techniques includes the mis miniincision total knee procedures and the mis quadsparing tm total knee replacement procedure with the incorporation of computer assisted surgeryenabled electromagnetic navigation capability the mis miniincision total knee instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues the mis quadsparing total knee procedure features advanced instrument concepts which allow surgeons to perform the total knee arthroplasty through a 710 cm incision without cutting the patient’s muscles or tendons 

  we offer a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including the following 

  nexgen ® complete knee solution  the nexgen knee product line is a comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had significant application in ps cr and revision procedures the nexgen knee system offers joint stability and sizing that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components the nexgen knee system provides surgeons with complete and versatile knee instrument options including zimmer mis quadsparing and mis miniincision instruments milling and multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument systems the breadth and versatility of the nexgen knee system allows surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during surgery according to the needs of the patient and to support current surgical philosophies 

  

  the nexgen legacy ® posterior stabilized knee product line provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate ligament the ps capabilities were augmented through the introduction of the nexgen legacy posterior stabilized flex knee the “lpsflex knee” a highflexion implant that has the potential to accommodate knee flexion up to a 155degree range of motion in some patients 

  the nexgen cr product line is designed to be used in conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament the nexgen crflex fixed bearing knee is designed with components to provide a greater range of motion for patients who require deep bending in their daily activities the nexgen crflex femoral components allow the surgeon to adjust component sizing without removing additional bone 

  the nexgen revision knee product line consists of several different products that are designed to provide clinical solutions to surgeons for various revision situations including a bone augmentation implant system made from our trabecular metal technology material these augments are designed to address significant bone loss in revision surgery 

  we introduced nexgen knee gender solutions tm femorals in 2006 these represent the first knee implants specifically shaped to offer fit and function optimized for anatomic features that are more commonly seen in female patients this is our first gender implant and is now an important strategic focus for us as more than half of total knee arthroplasty patients are female gender solutions femorals are available in both crflex and lpsflex configurations 

  we offer improved polyethylene performance in the nexgen knee system with our conventional polyethylene and prolong tm highly crosslinked polyethylene which offers reduced wear resistance to oxidation pitting and cracking and is the only insert cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda for resistance to delamination prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene is available in both nexgen crflex and lpsflex designs

  the zimmer ® unicompartmental highflex knee system the zimmer unicompartmental highflex knee system offers a high flexion design to unicompartmental knee surgery the high flexion product was designed specifically for mis procedures and technologies the system offers the surgeon the ability to conserve bone by replacing only the compartment of the knee that has had degenerative changes 

   total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis acetabulum of the natural hip hip procedures include first time or primary joint replacement as well as revision procedures approximately 40 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone the remaining are pressfit into bone which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies 

  our portfolio of mis techniques includes the zimmer mis 2incision the zimmer mis posterior and the zimmer mis anterolateral techniques the incision for a traditional open hip primary replacement may be approximately 12 inches long other less invasive approaches such as a “mini” incision for hips have been in existence for some time since january 2004 surgeons have been able to use a computer imageguided mis 2incision hip procedure with technology and instrumentation codeveloped by us and our mis technologies computer navigation partner medtronic inc we received a us patent for our mis 2incision hip procedure in 2004

  we are broadening our product offerings in each of the product categories and exploring new technologies that have applications in multiple areas for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we spent 1883 million 1755 million and 1667 million respectively on research and development the increased research and development expenditures have accelerated the output of new orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants spine and trauma products including advanced new materials product designs and surgical techniques our primary research and development facility is located in warsaw indiana in 2006 we made significant progress on our research and development facility expansion project in warsaw and construction is nearly complete we have other research and development personnel based in among other places winterthur switzerland austin texas minneapolis minnesota carlsbad california dover ohio and parsippany new jersey as of december 31 2006 we employed more than 550 research and development employees worldwide 

  we will continue to identify innovative technologies and consider acquiring complementary products or businesses or establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances 

government regulation and quality systems 

 

  we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business it is our policy to comply with all regulatory requirements governing our operations and products and we believe that the research development manufacturing and quality control procedures that we employ are in material compliance with all applicable regulations 

  in the united states numerous regulations govern the development testing manufacturing marketing and distribution of medical devices including among others the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder the fda regulates product safety and efficacy laboratory clinical and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping for medical devices and post market surveillance to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices a few of the devices we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval requirements all of our products marketed in the united states have been cleared or approved by the fda the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

  in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to local regulations affecting among other things design and product standards packaging requirements and labeling requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directive which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in european union member countries to provide ce marking of their products we maintain an iso certified quality system and comply with the requirements of the medical device directive which together enable us to apply the ce mark to 

  

products in those jurisdictions that require it europe canada australia and new zealand 

  we are subject to various government regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration va health programs and civilian health and medical program uniformed service champus the scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws 

  we are committed to providing high quality products to our customers and we have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality assurance department supervises our quality systems senior management is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing internal and external quality performance our regulatory affairs and compliance department is responsible for assuring compliance with all applicable regulations standards and internal policies 

  we have initiated numerous quality improvement programs and all of our manufacturing operations are certified to iso 134852003 global standard for quality management systems 

  our facilities and operations are also subject to various government environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the united states and foreign countries including those relating to discharges of substances in the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants we believe we are currently in material compliance with such requirements 

competition 

 

  the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and orthopaedic surgical products our major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc synthes inc smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and tornier inc 

  in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

  the european reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including mathys ag and plus orthopedics holdings ag which compete with us in addition to the global competitors today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for europe although global products are gaining acceptance therefore we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

  in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc and smith  nephew plc as well as regional companies including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

  in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc 

  in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp now operating as biomet trauma and biomet spine a subsidiary of biomet inc 

  competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation customer relationships and service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies where possible we will continue to seek patent trademark and other intellectual property protection concerning the surgical techniques materials technologies and products we design and develop 

manufacturing and raw materials 

 

  we manufacture substantially all of our products at eight locations including warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland ponce puerto rico dover ohio statesville north carolina carlsbad california parsippany new jersey and etupes france as part of the execution of the centerpulse integration plan we liquidated our austin texas facility in 2006 over the past two years we have expanded our other manufacturing sites to accommodate increased demand the transfer of production from the austin texas facility and the tripling of trabecular metal technology production capacity 

  we believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry standards in terms of automation and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth the manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational improvement in addition at certain of our manufacturing facilities many of the employees are crosstrained 

  we generally operate our manufacturing facilities at a targeted goal of approximately 90 percent of total capacity 

  

we continually evaluate the potential to insource products currently purchased from outside vendors to onsite production 

  improving manufacturing productivity has been a major contributor to improvement in profitability major areas of improvement have included utilization of computerassisted robots and multiaxis grinders to precision polish medical devices automation of certain manufacturing and inspection processes including onmachine inspection and process controls stateof theart equipment purchases and upgrades insourcing of core products such as castings and forgings highspeed machining and negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs 

  we use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the design development and manufacturing of our products we purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate unique technology we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance to date we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules 

intellectual property 

 

  patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position we protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors employees consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information we own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products 

employees 

 

  we employ more than 6900 employees worldwide including more than 550 employees dedicated to research and development nearly 4200 employees are located within the united states and more than 2700 employees are located outside of the united states primarily throughout europe and in japan we have over 2200 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide the warsaw indiana production facility employs more than 1000 employees fewer than 200 north american employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

  in may 2003 we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america covering employees at the dover ohio facility this agreement will continue in effect until may 15 2007 we are in preliminary negotiations with the union regarding the new agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

  risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

 

  our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

  we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including orthobiological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies 

  in the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants trauma products and other orthopaedic products a limited number of competitors including depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc wright medical group inc synthes inc and smith  nephew plc compete with us for the majority of product sales in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp a subsidiary of biomet inc in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc competition is primarily on the basis of 

 

  

   in markets outside of the united states other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

   any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

  if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

  we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

  in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services for example managed care programs often prescribe only those orthopaedic recovery products that match a patient as to age need for mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide more costeffective care if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other health care providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on sales financial condition and results of operations 

  in international markets where the movement toward health care reform and the development of managed care are generally not as advanced as in the united states we have experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of health care reform in japan for example a governmentoperated insurance system reimburses customers for our products under this system the japanese government periodically reviews and reduces the reimbursement levels for products if the japanese government continues to reduce the reimbursement level for orthopaedic products our sales financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  we are subject to costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

  we are involved in ongoing investigations by the united states department of justice of companies in the orthopaedics industry the results of which may have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

  in march 2005 we received a subpoena and we have received supplemental requests since that time from the united states department of justice through the united states attorney’s office in newark new jersey requesting documents and related information for the period beginning january 1998 related to consulting contracts professional service agreements and other agreements by which we may provide remuneration to orthopaedic surgeons including research and other grant agreements in june 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice antitrust division requesting documents for the period beginning january 2001 through june 2006 pertaining to an investigation of possible violations of federal criminal law including possible violations of the antitrust laws involving the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices we are cooperating fully with federal authorities with regard to these investigations which we understand involve a number of other orthopaedic manufacturers as well if as a result of these investigations we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful we may have to change those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

  the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  in addition if we fail to comply with applicable fda medical device or other material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations that failure could result in among other things 

   any of these actions in combination or alone could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things 

   many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries such as the european medical devices directive are similar to those of the fda in addition in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  as both the fda and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business will be harmed 

  we are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulations that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

  our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration va health programs and civilian health and medical program uniformed service champus the scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change because of the farreaching and uncertain nature of these laws we are required to monitor our practices to remain in compliance with these laws if we were to violate one or more of these laws our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if there is a change in law regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations some of our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful and as a result we may have to change those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

  our business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings in addition some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

  as part of our risk management policy we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage however product liability claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies may have substantial retentions or deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed 

  

the amount of those retentions or deductibles we will be responsible for paying any losses that are below those retentions or deductibles a product liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

 

  if we fail to effectively utilize the skills and knowledge of orthopaedic surgeons customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  we maintain professional relationships with a number of orthopaedic surgeons who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs these professionals speak about our products at medical seminars assist in the training of other professionals in the use of our products and provide us with feedback on the industry’s acceptance of our new products the failure of our products to retain the support of orthopaedic surgeons who frequently recommend products or are involved in product selection decisions or the failure of our new products to secure and retain similar support from surgeons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends largely upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of products and instruments many commonly provide operating room personnel with implant and instrument product training as well as product support in the operating room a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if some of the business practices of our independent sales agents and distributors are challenged as unlawful they may have to change these practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

   without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

   in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

  we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

  because we sell our products in more than 100 countries our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally in 2006 we derived approximately 15329 million or 44 of our total revenue from sales of our products outside of the united states we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

 

  

   any of these factors may individually or as a group have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

  a substantial portion of our foreign generated revenues are generated in europe and japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative financial instruments we enter into are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions the forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 

  we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

  our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents in the united states patent applications are confidential for 18 months following their filing and because third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications our patent applications may not have priority over patent applications of others in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage if a third party initiates litigation regarding our patents our collaborators’ patents or those patents for which we have license rights and is successful a court could declare our patents invalid or unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents 

  the united states patent and trademark office uspto and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more broadly the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and the risk of infringement litigation will likely increase on the other hand if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more narrowly the value of our proprietary rights may be reduced any changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

  in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors may also capture market share from us by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which would limit our growth and future revenue 

  we also rely upon trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive we attempt to protect this information with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and corporate collaborators these individuals may breach these agreements and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages furthermore our trade secrets knowhow and other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors 

  we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

  a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements however we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing selling or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  we may complete additional acquisitions which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

  we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions we may not be able to complete additional acquisitions or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems acquiring and integrating new businesses involves risk including the following 

   if we are unable to form strategic alliances or if our strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives our operating results will be negatively impacted 

  several of our strategic initiatives involve alliances with other orthopaedic and biotechnology companies these include our agreement with revivicor inc relating to orthopaedic tissue technology our collaboration with isto technologies inc relating to regenerative cartilage technology and our distribution agreement with heraeus relating to orthopaedic bone cement products the success of these and similar arrangements is largely dependent on technology and other intellectual property contributed by our strategic partners or the resources efforts and skills of these partners disputes and difficulties in such relationships are common often due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interest merger and acquisition activity may exacerbate these conflicts the benefits of these alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners 

   furthermore under some of our strategic alliances we may make milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these payments we also may make equity investments in our strategic partners these investments may decline in value and result in our incurring financial statement charges in the future 

  if we are unable to timely complete our search for a new chief executive officer and successfully transition to new leadership our business could be adversely affected 

  in november 2006 j raymond elliott our chairman president and chief executive officer informed our board of directors that he plans to retire from his positions as president and chief executive officer in the first half of 2007 assuming a successor ceo has been named he will remain as chairman through at least november 2007 our board of directors with the assistance of spencer stuart a global executive recruiting firm has begun a search for a successor which includes both internal and external candidates we cannot assure you when we will find a suitable candidate for this position and what effect if any a new ceo may have on our business and our ability to retain our senior executives and other key scientific technical sales marketing and other personnel the loss of the services of such senior executives or key personnel or any general instability in the composition of our senior management team could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business and operating strategies once we hire a new ceo our success will be dependent upon his or her ability to gain proficiency in leading our company his or her ability to implement or adapt our corporate strategies and initiatives and his or her ability to develop key professional relationships including relationships with our team members the independent distributors who market our products the orthopaedic surgeons who assist and advise us and our key suppliers and other business partners 

  we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

  we use a number of suppliers for raw materials we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our future profitability may be affected by changes to our product category and region sales mix 

  reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit margins among our product categories these products accounted for approximately 84 percent of 2006 net sales sales in our americas region accounted for approximately 60 percent of 2006 net sales sales in the americas region produce the highest operating profit margins in the geographic markets in which we operate while we expect net sales of reconstructive implants and net sales in the americas region to remain strong changes to our product category mix or our region sales mix could adversely affect our future profitability

  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements 

overview 

 

  we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as “osp” we also provide hospitalfocused consulting services to help member institutions design implement and manage successful orthopaedic programs of distinction which account for less than one percent of sales reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and postoperation rehabilitation through our consulting services we provide hospitals and other orthopaedic practices resource capabilities in the areas of business development marketing inoutpatient rehab practice clinical pathways care mapping and space design community relations customer service delivery models cost accounting staff utilization and more in order to improve the profit environment we have operations in more than 24 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments — the americas europe and asia pacific 

  we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2006 

demand volume and mix trends 

  increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 6 percentage points of 2006 sales growth which is 3 percentage points below the rate of growth from 2005 compared to 2004 a slowdown in procedure growth at acute care institutions in our largest operating segment as well as first half competitive losses in hips contributed to the slower growth in product sales we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis will continue to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the continued shift in demand to premium products such as longevity durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products highflex knees knee revision products and porous hip stems continue to positively affect sales growth for example during 2006 sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over 165 million a yearoveryear increase of over 40 percent 

  we believe the most effective way to address rising health care costs without affecting patient access or treatment options is a systemic approach this year we acquired hmi which specializes in helping hospitals to improve their business processes hmi will be part of a new zimmer business unit specifically focused on health economic issues this will include developing new clinicaleconomic data expanding our current pathways program and helping to develop improved office management processes and technology we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry we continued our significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants procedures and technologies during the year ended december 31 2006 the zimmer institute and its satellite locations trained nearly 2000 surgeons on advanced techniques including over 1300 surgeons on mis procedures 

pricing trends 

  selling prices were up modestly during 2006 compared with a 1 percentage point increase during 2005 when compared to 2004 asia pacific selling prices decreased 2 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to a negligible change in 2005 when compared to 2004 effective april 1 2006 the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates which contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in japan by approximately 4 percent during 2006 japan represents approximately 8 percent of our sales effective january 1 2007 the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates again we estimate this action will affect japan sales negatively by approximately 35 percent for 2007 the americas experienced a 2 percent increase in selling prices during 2006 compared to a 1 percent increase in 2005 in europe selling prices for 2006 decreased 1 percent the same decrease we saw in 2005 as compared to 2004 within europe germany which constitutes approximately 6 percent of our sales experienced a 4 percent decrease in selling prices in 2006 as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates the united kingdom which comprises 3 percent of our sales reported a similar 4 percent decline in selling prices for the year the price declines in germany and the united kingdom were partially offset by increased selling prices in other european markets with continuing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and group purchasing organizations we 

  

estimate global sales could be adversely affected by 1 to 2 percent in 2007 due to changes in selling prices 

foreign currency exchange rates 

  for 2006 foreign currency exchange rates had a modest negative effect on global sales growth a weaker us dollar compared to most foreign currencies in the three month period ended december 31 2006 compared to the same 2005 period increased sales by 2 percentage points if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2007 of approximately 08 percent on sales we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

new product sales 

  new products which we define as products or stock keeping units “sku’s” introduced within the prior 36month period to a particular market accounted for 24 percent or 828 million of 2006 sales adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of performance in our industry our sales have grown with the introduction of new products such as the gender solutions knee durom acetabular system with metasul technology trabecular metal primary hip prosthesis versys epoch composite hip stem acetabular revision system zimmer ncb plating system anatomical shoulder inversereverse systems and zimmer universal locking plates 

  we expect new products in our current pipeline will favorably affect our future operating performance products we expect to contribute to new product sales in 2007 include in addition to those listed above an mis porolock ® stem durom hemi femoral with metasul technology porolock ® titanium surface stem with kinectiv tm technology naturalknee ii highflex gender nexgen lps highflex mobile bearing knee dynesys top loading dynamic stabilization and brigit tm bone resection instrument guide 

strategic initiatives — enable innovate and grow 

  our refined corporate strategies now focus on our ability to enable to innovate and to grow each of these corporate strategies has three initiatives linked with it in total these initiatives will guide our business plan for the foreseeable future we believe these initiatives will enable us to effectively respond to key trends in the orthopaedics industry while continuing to build upon our strengths some of these are further discussed below 

  we will enable growth by among other actions reaching out to new audiences historically our focus has been primarily on the surgeon health care provider and the orthopaedic wing of the hospital more decision makers are now involved these include consumers with specific focus on special consumer groups such as women the obese ethnic groups agespecific groups governments general practitioners and nurses insurance companies and other payors and professional societies a directtopatient campaign we are conducting in the united states to support the gender solutions knee product launch and the back in the groove tm community healthcare program aimed at providing african american arthritis sufferers increased access to information about knee and hip replacement options are examples of how we can reach out to these new audiences 

  we will innovate new and unique solutions for orthopaedic patients biologics is the new frontier of orthopaedics with enormous potential to provide new treatment approaches for patients we already have a strong foundation in this area for example through an agreement with revivicor inc we obtained exclusive worldwide distribution rights for genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies including soft tissue biological repair and replacement in partnership with isto technologies we are developing cartilage regeneration and cellbased therapies called neocartilage technology 

  we will grow through appropriately planned investment infrastructure investments are planned to support future growth which include but are not limited to the substantial investments we are making to our facilities around the world they also include improvements to our organizational infrastructure such as vertical integration insourcing expanded quality systems information technology efficiency leadingedge compliance stateof theart automation and advanced education 

acquisitions of centerpulse and implex 

  we are near completion of our integration plans for centerpulse and implex we incurred an aggregate of 322 million in acquisition and integration costs and expenses from october 2003 through december 2006 although the vast majority of the integration activities are behind us a few items still remain some of those items include continued it systems conversions continued manufacturing insourcing and some warehouse consolidations in a few countries 

new accounting pronouncements 

  on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” we adopted this accounting standard using the modified prospective method and will not restate prior periods sharebased payment expense had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per share by 022 during the year ended december 31 2006 our sharebased payment expense is primarily derived from awards of stock options and equity share units we did not grant any equity share units until 2006 prior to january 1 2006 under accounting principle board opinion no 25 “apb 25” sharebased payment expense was not significant because the exercise price of the stock options we granted generally equaled the market price 

  

of the underlying stock on the measurement date of the stock options and no equity share units had been awarded sharebased payment expense is a noncash expense and therefore had no effect on our net cash flows 

  as of december 31 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” this statement requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position as a result our liabilities increased by 313 million however this had no effect on our results of operations or cash flows for more information on the effect of this standard see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements which are included in this report under item 8

  dental extremities and spine experienced double digit percentage growth compared to the prior year the tapered screwvent implant system led dental sales the trabecular metal shoulder stems led extremities sales the dynesys dynamic stabilization system and spinal trabecular metal spacers led spine sales while trauma sales returned to solid growth behind zimmer periarticular plates the zimmer ncb plating system the sirus im nail and itst intertrochanteric subtrochanteric fixation system 

   the following table presents europe net sales dollars in millions 

   strong knee sales continued to drive growth in europe eight percent volume and mix growth was offset by a 2 percent drop in average selling prices for knees in europe the nexgen complete knee solution product line and the innex total knee system led knee sales hip sales growth was negatively affected by reduced selling prices in germany italy portugal and the united kingdom the cls spotorno stem longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners metasul ldh heads and trabecular metal acetabular cups led hip sales 

  dental extremities trauma spine and osp again experienced double digit percentage growth compared to the prior year dental sales were led by the tapered screwvent implant system the anatomical shoulder system led extremities sales zimmer periarticular plates and the zimmer ncb plating system led trauma sales trabecular metal spacers led spine sales strong sales of wound management products contributed to the osp sales performance 

  

   the following table presents asia pacific net sales dollars in millions 

   a stronger us dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a negative 3 percent effect on sales for asia pacific including a 3 percent drop in knee sales and a negative 4 percent impact on hip sales a reduction in reimbursement prices for orthopaedic implants in japan went into effect april 1 2006 together with other price changes in this segment this action led to a negative 2 percent effect on sales including negative 2 percent on knees and negative 4 percent on hips volume and mix growth more than offset the negative effects of price and currency in knees while netting out to result in flat sales in hips strong knee sales drove growth in asia pacific the nexgen crflex knee and the nexgen lpsflex knee led knee sales the continued conversion to porous stems including the versys hip system and the cls spotorno stem led hip sales sales of longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and trabecular metal acetabular cups also exhibited strong growth 

  dental experienced double digit percentage growth compared to the prior year the tapered screwvent implant system and the spline ® implant system led dental sales extremity sales were impacted by lower sales of the bigliani flatow shoulder system strong powered instrument sales contributed to the osp sales performance 

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 777 percent in 2006 compared to 775 percent in 2005 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2005 to 2006 

   higher average selling prices in our largest operating segment offset by lower prices in europe and asia pacific contributed to the modest improvement in gross margin other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were the net favorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses and manufacturing productivity gains offset by underlying exposure gains and losses increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines and increased royalty expenses as a percentage of sales due to a higher mix of royalty bearing sales 

   research and development or rd as a percentage of net sales was 54 percent for 2006 compared to 53 percent in 2005 rd increased to 1883 million for 2006 from 1755 million in 2005 reflecting increased spending on projects focused on our redefined corporate strategies and 87 million of sharebased payment expense in 2006 we expanded our biologics group based in austin texas we continued working with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies including soft tissue biological repair and replacement we also worked to develop sophisticated tools for surgeons the zimmer brigit bone resection instrument guide is an example of these sophisticated tools other examples include new sensor technologies computer assisted solutions personalized for specific surgeons digital instruments and digitalelectronic templating currently our product pipeline consists of approximately 100 active new product development projects we are also investing in additional gender implant designs following on the successful launch of our zimmer gender solutions knee mis procedures and technologies material technologies including woven materials and drugdevice combinations and intelligence technologies including sensor technology new products which we define as those introduced into a market in the preceding thirtysix months accounted for approximately 24 percent of net sales in 2006 compared with 21 percent in 2005 in the second half of 2006 we launched twenty new products twelve of those represented major launches such as the gender solutions knee durom acetabular system with metasul technology versys epoch composite hip stem and the trabecular metal acetabular revision system we continue to target our rd spending at the high end of what we believe to be an industry average of 46 percent 

  selling general and administrative or sga as a percentage of net sales was 388 percent for 2006 compared to 383 percent in 2005 sharebased compensation added 559 million of expense for the year ended december 31 2006 or an additional 16 percentage points when compared with 2005 absent sharebased compensation sga as a percentage of net sales decreased the decrease was primarily due to sales growth realized expense synergies and well controlled spending 

  acquisition integration and other items for 2006 were 61 million compared to 566 million in 2005 and included 277 million of income related to three unrelated matters — the sale of the former centerpulse austin land and facilities for a gain of 51 million and the favorable settlement of two preacquisition contingent liabilities a reduction in product liability accounted for 49 million of income expense items included a 134 million impairment charge for certain centerpulse tradename and trademark intangibles based principally in our europe operating segment 88 million of integration consulting expenses 33 million of employee 

  

severance and retention costs 30 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems 29 million of inprocess research and development 25 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members and 48 million of other expenses 

   operating profit for 2006 increased 10 percent to 11652 million from 10550 million in 2005 increased sales improved gross profit margins realized operating expense synergies controlled operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration expenses offset 760 million of sharebased compensation expense to drive the increase in operating profit 

  the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest decreased to 286 percent for 2006 down from 295 percent in 2005 the reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions including puerto rico 

  net earnings increased 14 percent to 8345 million for 2006 compared to 7325 million in 2005 the increase was due to higher operating profit lower acquisition integration and other expenses decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower effective tax rate offset by 545 million of sharebased compensation expense net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent to 343 and 340 respectively from 296 and 293 in 2005

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 775 percent in 2005 compared to 738 percent in 2004 the following table reconciles the gross margin for 2004 to 2005 

   inventory stepup costs in the year ended december 31 2005 decreased to 50 million or 02 percent of sales compared to 594 million or 20 percent of sales in 2004 we define “inventory stepup” as the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired centerpulse and implex inventories other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were reduced inventory charges due to improved inventory management increased selling prices favorable resolution of certain legal and other matters and reduced royalties royalty expenses as a percentage of sales declined due to a favorable mix of nonroyalty bearing sales 

   rd as a percentage of net sales was 53 percent for 2005 compared to 56 percent in 2004 rd increased to 1755 million for 2005 from 1667 million in 2004 reflecting increased spending on projects focused on areas of strategic significance including orthobiologics in 2005 we doubled the number of internal people and projectrelated orthobiological investments at the end of 2005 our product pipeline consisted of more than 160 active projects we also invested in mis procedures and technologies material technologies including woven materials and drugdevice combinations and intelligence technologies including sensor technology we delivered more than 79 projects to the market in 2005 

  sga as a percentage of net sales was 383 percent for 2005 compared to 399 percent in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to sales growth and realized expense synergies in addition lower product liability claims and well controlled general and administrative spending reduced sga as a percentage of sales

  the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to 295 percent for 2005 from 259 percent in 2004 the provision for income taxes in 2004 included a 345 million benefit 47 percent as a result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate even without this one time benefit we realized a lower effective tax rate for 2005 the reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions including puerto rico in 2004 the successful negotiation of the lower swiss tax rate was effective for the last five months of the year whereas in 2005 the benefit was recognized for the entire year 

  net earnings increased 35 percent to 7325 million for 2005 compared to 5418 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profit and decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance offset by a higher effective tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 and 34 percent to 296 and 293 respectively from 222 and 219 in 2004

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  cash flows provided by operating activities were 10407 million in 2006 compared to 8782 million in 2005 the principal source of cash was net earnings of 8345 million noncash charges included in net earnings accounted for another 2734 million of operating cash all other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of 672 million of cash pertaining principally to investments in working capital in support of sales growth 

  we continue to focus on working capital management at december 31 2006 we had 55 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable an increase of 4 days when compared to december 31 2005 a modest slowdown in payments from health care institutions occurred in all reporting segments at december 31 2006 we had 277 days of inventory on hand favorable to december 31 2005 by 6 days our inventory levels have improved from a third quarter high of 310 days as a result of seasonal demand patterns and internal efforts to redeploy inventory to eliminate unnecessary safety stocks and improve inventory turns 

  cash flows used in investing activities were 2870 million in 2006 compared to 3111 million in 2005 in 2006 we made a final payment of 281 million pursuant to the terms of the implex acquisition agreement for contingent earnout payments this compares with a payment of 441 million in 2005 additions to instruments during 2006 were 1262 million compared to 1500 million in 2005 certain of our 2006 product launches such as our gender solutions knee demanded lower relative instrument purchases as we were able to leverage existing instrument systems for this new product in 2007 we expect to spend approximately 120 – 130 million on instruments to support new products sales growth and mis procedures we have realized benefits from insourcing instruments at a lower cost additions to other property plant and equipment during 2006 were 1421 million compared to 1053 million in 2005 increases were related to facility expansions in warsaw indiana ponce puerto rico and parsippany new jersey these facility expansions improved working conditions and capabilities for our research and development organization and responded to increased demand the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites as a result of the closure of the austin texas facility and the tripling of trabecular metal technology production capacity during 2007 we expect to purchase approximately 170 – 180 million in other property plant and equipment as a result of ongoing facility expansions in warsaw indiana ponce puerto rico winterthur switzerland and investment in new information technology systems and further productivityrelated initiatives 

  cash flows used in financing activities were 7307 million for 2006 compared to 4846 million in 2005 in december 2005 our board of directors approved a 1 billion stock repurchase program we repurchased 7988 million of our common stock in 2006 as compared with 41 million in 2005 in december 2006 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an additional 1 billion of our common stock through december 31 2008 we utilized cash generated from operating activities and 413 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans to fund the repurchases we expect to use excess cash to fund future purchases if any under these programs 

  we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing march 31 2010 the “senior credit facility” we had 996 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2006 and an availability of 12504 million the 996 million is for use in japan and carries a low interest rate the senior credit facility contains a provision by which we can increase the line to 1750 million 

  we and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly 

  

owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 35 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2006 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility and a utilization fee the senior credit facility is rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services and is not rated by moody’s investors’ service inc 

  we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 609 million 

  management believes that cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

contractual obligations 

 

  we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 critical accounting estimates 

 

  our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

  excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workin progress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

  income taxes  – we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense liabilities and reserves we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 

  commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model the amounts established equate to less than 5 of total liabilities and represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies 

  goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 

  

recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets as such these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 

  sharebased payment  – we account for sharebased payment expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock additionally we must estimate the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

 

  we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

  we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

  for contracts outstanding at december 31 2006 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars and korean won or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2007 through june 2009 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2006 and 2005 were 13743 million and 1142 million respectively the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2006 were 205 million the weighted average contract rates outstanding are eurousd 129 usdswiss franc 120 usdjapanese yen 106 british poundusd 182 usdcanadian dollar 115 australian dollarusd 074 and usdkorean won 954 

  we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2006 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2009 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 737 million 214 million 189 million 138 million 65 million 69 million and 23 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and korean won contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

  we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 1672 million at december 31 2006 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1102 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2006 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency translation gainslosses recognized in earnings under sfas no 52 “foreign currency translation” are generally offset with gainlosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

  we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into 12 to 24 month supply contracts where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk 

 

  in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

  presently we invest our cash and equivalents in money market and investmentgrade shortterm debt instruments the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

  our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities presently all of our debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2006 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense however because the effects of any method selected to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes are uncertain this analysis assumes that management will take no action to mitigate interest rate risk further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

  financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

  we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 

  we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

  concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and health care systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

   in 2005 we continued to expand our efforts to apply minimally invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery which we refer to as minimally invasive solutions tm  mis tm  procedures and technologies the zimmer institute with its main facility located at our global headquarters has been used in addition to satellite centers established in connection with 25 existing zimmer institute partnerships to facilitate the training of over 4000 surgeons on several mis procedures in 2005 alone we trained nearly 2500 surgeons through the zimmer institute network 

  we work directly with several global medical centers to evaluate and refine advanced minimally invasive knee and hip replacement procedures we plan to continue to affiliate with additional north american and international institutions to provide surgeon education at the zimmer institute and its satellite locations the principal goals of these mis technology efforts are to reduce the hardships of having a total joint replacement such as the time a patient must spend in rehabilitation pain reduction and lost time from work 

  in december 2005 we announced that we are following more than 2500 zimmer ® mis 2incision tm total hip replacement procedure cases in active clinical studies we estimate that in total more than 3000 of these procedures have been performed worldwide since inception in 2001 at the february 2005 american academy of orthopaedic surgeons meeting in washington dc we introduced the zimmer mis anterolateral hip replacement procedure that was developed with the specific intent to expand patient benefits relative to standard hip replacement surgery among our achievements in mis procedures and technologies in knees during 2005 we began commercializing the nexgen ® mis tibial plate the first modular stemmed tibial component prosthesis that can be assembled within the patient making it more conducive to minimally invasive procedures 

  throughout 2005 we continued to develop navigation systems through the use of imageguided surgical technology to aid surgeons in learning procedures and gaining confidence in the placement of instrumentation and implants where navigation is difficult due to the small incisions necessary in effectuating minimally invasive procedures in february 2005 we announced that the first electromagnetic casenabled knee replacement procedures were successfully performed in houston texas orthopaedic surgeons are now performing these navigation procedures in association with the zimmer mis quadsparing tm total knee replacement procedure and the zimmer mis miniincision total knee procedure 

  we are focused both on further commercializing existing mis technique approaches and investigating new ways to apply mis technology principles to additional procedures and products we continue to believe that the commitment of substantial financial and other resources in furtherance of mis procedures and technologies is critical 

   total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articulating surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining cr designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized ps designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with an unicompartmental knee prosthesis 

  our portfolio of mis techniques includes the mis miniincision total knee procedures and the mis quadsparing total knee replacement procedure with the incorporation of casenabled electromagnetic navigation capability the mis miniincision total knee instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues the mis quadsparing total knee procedure features advanced instrument concepts which allow surgeons to perform the total knee arthroplasty through a 710 cm incision without cutting the patient’s muscles or tendons 

  we offer a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including among others the following brands 

  nexgen ® complete knee solution the nexgen knee product line is a comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had significant application in ps cr and revision procedures the nexgen knee system offers joint stability and sizing that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components the nexgen knee system provides surgeons with complete and versatile knee instrument options including zimmer mis quadsparing and mis miniincision instruments milling and multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument systems the breadth and versatility of the nexgen knee system allows surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during surgery according to the needs of the patient and to support current surgical philosophies the ongoing use of trabecular metal monoblock tibial components in both cr and ps philosophies enhances our strategy to add new innovative technologies to this brand trabecular metal materials provide a higher level of porosity and surface friction than existing noncemented alternatives and are similar in stiffness to natural bone 

  

  the nexgen complete knee solution legacy ® kneeposterior stabilized product line provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate ligament the ps capabilities were augmented through the introduction of the nexgen legacy posterior stabilized flex knee the “lpsflex knee” a highflexion implant that has the potential to accommodate knee flexion up to a 155degree range of motion in some patients

competition 

 

  the orthopaedics industry is highly competitive in the global markets for reconstructive implants trauma and orthopaedic surgical products major competitors include depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc synthes inc smith  nephew plc and wright medical group inc 

  in the americas geographic segment we and depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation biomet inc smith  nephew inc a subsidiary of smith  nephew plc wright medical group inc and synthes inc account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales 

  in the asia pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products we compete primarily with depuy orthopaedics inc stryker corporation synthes inc and smith  nephew plc as well as regional companies 

  

including japan medical materials corporation and japan medical dynamic marketing inc factors such as the dealer system complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price make it difficult for smaller companies particularly those that are nonregional to compete effectively with the market leaders in the asia pacific region 

  in europe the reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than the americas or the asia pacific segments the variety of philosophies held by european surgeons regarding hip reconstruction for example has fostered the existence of many regional european companies including mathys ag and plus orthopedics holdings ag which compete with us in addition to the global competitors today most hip implants sold in europe are products developed specifically for europe although global products are gaining acceptance therefore we will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific european needs 

  in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp a subsidiary of biomet inc 

  in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc 

  competition within the industry is primarily based on technology innovation quality reputation customer relationships and service a key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies where possible we will continue to seek patent trademark and other intellectual property protection concerning the surgical techniques materials technologies and products we design and develop

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

  risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

 

  our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors 

  we operate in a highly competitive environment our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including orthobiological therapies to remain competitive we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies 

  in the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants trauma products and other orthopaedic products a limited number of competitors including depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson stryker corporation biomet inc wright medical group inc synthes inc and smith  nephew plc compete with us for the majority of product sales in the spinal implant category we compete globally primarily with medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthes inc stryker corporation and ebi lp a subsidiary of biomet inc in the dental reconstructive implant category we compete primarily with nobel biocare holding ag straumann holding ag and implant innovations inc a subsidiary of biomet inc competition is primarily on the basis of 

   in local markets outside of the united states other factors influence competition as well including 

   our competitors may 

   any of these factors alone or in combination could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products 

  if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed 

  we sell our products and services to hospitals doctors dentists and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to their patients from thirdparty payors such as domestic and international government programs private insurance plans and managed care programs these thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by the thirdparty payor or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for our products 

  in addition thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services for example managed care programs often prescribe only those orthopaedic recovery products that match a patient as to age need for mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide more costeffective care if thirdparty payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other health care providers for our products demand for our products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products which could have a material adverse effect on sales financial condition and results of operation 

  in international markets where the movement toward health care reform and the development of managed care are generally not as advanced as in the united states we have experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of health care reform in japan for example a governmentoperated insurance system reimburses customers 

  

for our products under this system the japanese government periodically reviews and reduces the reimbursement levels for products if the japanese government continues to reduce the reimbursement level for orthopaedic products our sales financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected 

  we are subject to costcontainment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  many existing and potential customers for our products have combined to form group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products and if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement our failure to respond to the costcontainment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

  we are involved in an ongoing investigation by the united states department of justice of companies in the orthopaedics industry the results of which may have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

  on march 31 2005 we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice through the united states attorney’s office in newark new jersey requesting documents related to consulting contracts or professional service agreements we have with orthopaedic surgeons we understand that similar inquiries were directed to at least four other companies in the orthopaedics industry we are cooperating fully with federal authorities with regard to this matter if as a result of this investigation we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful we may have to change those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible with these regulations 

  the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  in addition if we fail to comply with applicable fda medical device or other material regulatory requirements including for example the quality system regulation recordkeeping regulations labeling requirements and adverse event reporting regulations that failure could result in among other things 

   any of these actions in combination or alone could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things 

   many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries such as the european medical devices directive are similar to those of the fda in addition in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  as both the fda and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our business will be harmed 

  we are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulations that could require us to change our 

  

business practices and restrict our operations in the future 

  our industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances fines imprisonment and within the united states exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration va health programs and civilian health and medical program uniformed service champus the scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change because of the farreaching and uncertain nature of these laws we are required to monitor our practices to remain in compliance with these laws if we were to violate one or more of these laws our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if there is a change in law regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations some of our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful and as a result we may have to change those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 

  our business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings in addition some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

  as part of our risk management policy we maintain thirdparty product liability insurance coverage however product liability claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a selfinsured loss even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy these policies may have substantial retentions or deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of those retentions or deductibles we will be responsible for paying any losses that are below those retentions or deductibles a product liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

 

  if we fail to effectively utilize the skills and knowledge of orthopaedic surgeons customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  we maintain professional relationships with a number of orthopaedic surgeons who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs these professionals speak about our products at medical seminars assist in the training of other professionals in the use of our products and provide us with feedback on the industry’s acceptance of our new products the failure of our products to retain the support of orthopaedic surgeons who frequently recommend products or are involved in product selection decisions or the failure of our new products to secure and retain similar support from surgeons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  our marketing success in the united states and abroad depends largely upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of products and instruments many commonly provide operating room personnel with implant and instrument product training as well as product support in the operating room a loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if some of the business practices of our independent sales agents and distributors are challenged as unlawful they may have to change those practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 

  demand for our products may change in certain cases in ways we may not anticipate because of 

   without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products may become obsolete over time if that happens our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 

  

   in addition new materials product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly in some or all markets because of among other factors 

   moreover innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production in addition even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

  we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the united states which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

  because we sell our products in more than 100 countries our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally in 2005 we derived approximately 1344 million or 41 of our total revenue from sales of our products outside of the united states we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

   any of these factors may individually or as a group have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations which can increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

  a substantial portion of our foreign generated revenues are generated in europe and japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative financial instruments we enter into are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions the forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 

  we may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts 

  our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents in the united states patent applications are confidential for 18 months following their filing and because third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications our patent applications may not have priority over patent applications of others in addition our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage if a third party initiates litigation regarding our patents our collaborators’ patents or those patents for which we have license rights and is successful a court could declare our patents invalid or unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents 

  the united states patent and trademark office uspto and the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and biotechnology patents if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more 

  

broadly the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and the risk of infringement litigation will likely increase on the other hand if the uspto or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more narrowly the value of our proprietary rights may be reduced any changes in or unexpected interpretations of the patent laws may adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position 

  in addition intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors may also capture market share from us by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired which would limit our growth and future revenue 

  we also rely upon trade secrets proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive we attempt to protect this information with security measures including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and corporate collaborators these individuals may breach these agreements and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages furthermore our trade secrets knowhow and other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors 

  we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 

  a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and profitability in some cases materially from time to time we receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and receive claims of potential infringement we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology if someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements however we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing selling or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we may complete additional acquisitions which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive 

  we intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions we may not be able to complete additional acquisitions or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems acquiring and integrating new businesses involves risk including the following 

   if we are unable to form strategic alliances or if our strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives our operating results will be negatively impacted 

  several of our strategic initiatives involve alliances with other orthopaedic and biotechnology companies these include our agreement with revivicor inc relating to orthopaedic tissue technology our collaboration with isto technologies inc relating to regenerative cartilage technology and our distribution agreement with heraeus relating to orthopaedic bone cement products the success of these and similar arrangements is largely dependent on technology and other intellectual property contributed by our strategic partners or the resources efforts and skills of these partners disputes and difficulties in such relationships are common often due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interest merger and acquisition activity may exacerbate these conflicts the benefits of these alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners 

   furthermore under some of our strategic alliances we may make milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these payments we also may make equity investments in our strategic partners these investments may decline in value and result in our incurring financial statement charges in the future 

  we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities 

  we use a number of suppliers for raw materials we need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities these suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to 

  

meet our quality and regulatory requirements some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources a prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our future profitability may be affected by changes to our product category and region sales mix 

  reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit margins among our product categories these products accounted for approximately 83 percent of 2005 net sales sales in our americas region accounted for approximately 59 percent of 2005 net sales sales in the americas region produce the highest operating profit margins in the geographic markets in which we operate while we expect net sales of reconstructive implants and net sales in the americas region to remain strong changes to our product category mix or our region sales mix could adversely affect our future profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements 

overview 

 

  we are a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as “osp” reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and postoperation rehabilitation we have operations in more than 24 countries and market products in more than 100 countries we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments – the americas europe and asia pacific 

  we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 

demand volume and mix trends 

  increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 9 percentage points of sales growth which is the same as 2004 sales growth when compared to 2003 on a pro forma 7 basis we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population obesity proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the continued shift in demand to premium products such as longevity durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes trabecular metal technology products highflex knees knee revision products and porous hip stems continue to positively affect sales growth for example during the year ended december 31 2005 sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over 100 million an increase of nearly 40 percent over 2004 

  we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry we have made significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants procedures and technologies during the year ended december 31 2005 the zimmer institute and its satellite locations trained nearly 2500 surgeons on advanced techniques including over 2200 surgeons on mis procedures which is approximately 70 percent greater than the number of surgeons trained last year

  selling price increases contributed 1 percentage point of sales growth during the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 2 percentage points in 2004 when compared to 2003 on a pro forma basis the reduced benefit from selling price increases in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributed to the americas operating segment the americas experienced a 1 percent increase in selling prices during the year ended december 31 2005 compared to a 4 percent increase in 2004 on a pro forma basis we believe the slower growth in selling price increases was primarily due to hospital cost containment efforts in europe selling prices for the year ended december 31 2005 decreased 1 percent compared to a negligible effect in 2004 on a pro forma basis within europe germany which constitutes approximately 6 percent of our sales experienced a 5 percent decrease in selling prices in the year ended december 31 2005 as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates the decline in germany was partially offset by increased selling prices in other european markets asia pacific selling prices had a negligible effect on sales for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to a 2 percent decrease in 2004 on a pro forma basis effective april 1 2004 the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates which contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in japan by approximately 4 percent during the year ended december 31 2004 on a pro forma basis the negative effect of this decrease in japan occurred only in the first quarter of 2005 as the anniversary of the price reductions was april 1 2005 japan represents approximately 9 percent of our sales the next japanese reimbursement change is expected to be april 1 2006 and therefore we expect japanese selling prices to remain the same through the first quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year we expect the japanese government to reduce reimbursement rates again at that time we estimate this reduction will affect japan sales negatively by approximately 5 percent for the year ending december 31 2006 based upon zimmer japan’s portfolio of reconstructive and trauma products with pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and group purchasing organizations we estimate 

 

 

  

global sales could decline by approximately 1 percent in 2006 due to selling price decreases 

foreign currency exchange rates 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on global sales growth however a stronger us dollar compared to most foreign currencies in the three month period ended december 31 2005 compared to the same 2004 period decreased sales by 3 percentage points if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates we estimate that weaker foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect of approximately 1 percent on sales for the year ended december 31 2006 we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth but due to offsetting gainslosses on hedge contracts which are recorded in cost of products sold the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 

new product sales 

  new products which management defines as products or stock keeping units “sku’s” introduced within the prior 36month period to a particular market accounted for 21 percent or 695 million of our sales during the year ended december 31 2005 adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of industry performance our sales have grown with the introduction of new products such as trabecular metal modular acetabular cups certain sku’s of the nexgen complete knee solution for the lps lpsflex and crflex knees and the dynesys dynamic stabilization system 

  we believe new products in our current pipeline should continue to favorably affect our operating performance products we expect to contribute to new product sales in 2006 include products incorporating trabecular metal technology including a hip stem and humeral shoulder the versys epoch ® composite full coat hip prosthesis the nexgen mis tibial plate various trauma products including new zimmer periarticular locking plates and the sirus intramedullary nail system released to the us market and alternative bearing surfaces including ceramicon ceramic and metalon metal 

acquisition of centerpulse 

  we are near completion of our integration plan for centerpulse in the fourth quarter of 2005 we ceased manufacturing operations at our austin texas facility remaining integration milestones relate to it systems conversions primarily in europe and asia pacific the residual costs of decommissioning the austin facility and disposing of this asset continued insourcing and a few miscellaneous items we expect to complete the integration plan for centerpulse by the end of 2006 

  net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of centerpulse were approximately 63 million in 2005 we define net synergies as expense synergies less operating profit reductions resulting from integration related sales losses and increases in operating expenses directly resulting from the acquisition with the majority of our manufacturing integration plan completed additional expense synergies should be realized in 2006 and 2007 as the inventory produced after the completion of the integration plan is sold operating expense synergies principally in selling general and administrative expenses have exceeded our original expectations reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies we estimate our integration related sales losses and increased operating expenses were approximately 28 million in 2005 expense synergies for 2006 are expected to be in excess of 100 million we expect these synergies will be slightly offset by sales losses and increased operating expenses 

  we incurred 566 million of acquisition and integration expenses during the year ended december 31 2005 and expect to incur 12 – 15 million of acquisition and integration expenses in 2006 

acquisition of implex 

  we completed the acquisition of implex on april 23 2004 we had a strategic alliance with implex since 2000 for the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating trabecular metal technology pursuant to the strategic alliance we sold products incorporating trabecular metal technology which represented over 90 percent of implex sales 

new accounting pronouncements 

  on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” we adopted this accounting standard using the prospective method and will not restate prior periods we estimate the adoption of this accounting standard will reduce diluted earnings per share by 023 – 025 during the year ended december 31 2006 however this is a noncash expense and will not have an effect on our net cash flows

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 775 percent in the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 738 percent in 2004 the following table reconciles the gross margin for the year ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

   inventory stepup costs in the year ended december 31 2005 decreased to 50 million or 02 percent of sales compared to 594 million or 20 percent of sales in 2004 we define “inventory stepup” as the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired centerpulse and implex inventories other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were reduced inventory charges due to improved inventory management increased selling prices favorable resolution of certain legal and other matters and reduced royalties royalty expenses as a percentage of sales declined due to a favorable mix of nonroyalty bearing sales 

   rd as a percentage of net sales was 53 percent for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 56 percent in 2004 rd increased to 1755 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 1667 million in 2004 reflecting increased spending on projects focused on areas of strategic significance including orthobiologics in 2005 we doubled the number of internal people and projectrelated orthobiological investments currently our product pipeline consists of more than 160 active projects we are also investing in mis procedures and technologies material technologies including woven materials and drugdevice combinations and intelligence technologies including sensor technology we delivered more than 79 projects to the market in 2005 we target rd spending to the high end of what management believes to be an average of 46 percent for the industry 

  sga as a percentage of net sales was 383 percent for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 399 percent in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to sales growth and realized expense synergies in addition lower product liability claims and well controlled general and administrative spending reduced sga as a percentage of sales 

  acquisition integration and other expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 were 566 million compared to 811 million in 2004 and included 133 million of employee severance and retention expenses 127 million of sales agent contract termination expenses 69 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems 62 million of facility relocation expenses 56 million of integration consulting expenses 32 million related to the impairment loss on the austin facility 31 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members and 56 million of other expenses 

   operating profit for the year ended december 31 2005 increased 38 percent to 10550 million from 7632 million in 2004 increased sales improved gross profit margins realized operating expense synergies controlled operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration expenses drove operating profit 

  the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to 295 percent for the year ended december 31 2005 from 259 percent in 2004 the provision for income taxes in 2004 included a 345 million benefit 47 percent as a result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate exclusive of this one time benefit in the provision for income taxes we were able to realize a lower effective tax rate the reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions including puerto rico in 2004 the successful negotiation of the lower swiss tax rate was effective for the last five months of the year whereas in 2005 the benefit was recognized for the entire year 

  net earnings increased 35 percent to 7325 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 5418 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profit and decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance offset by a higher effective tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 and 34 percent to 296 and 293 respectively from 222 and 219 in 2004

   decreased centerpulse and implex inventory stepup charges as a percentage of net sales during 2004 594 million or 20 percent of net sales compared to the three month period ended december 31 2003 427 million or 61 percent of net sales and increases in selling prices were the primary contributors to improved gross margins in addition operating segment mix and product category mix both had a positive effect on gross margins due to higher sales growth in the more profitable americas segment compared to europe and asia pacific higher sales growth of reconstructive implants and the continued shift to premium products offsetting these favorable effects were a variety of other items including increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange contracts included in cost of products sold partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to automation vertical integration and process improvements 

   rd as a percentage of net sales was 56 percent for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 rd increased to 1667 million from 1058 million reflecting a full year of centerpulse research and development expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance during 2004 we delivered more than 40 major development projects to market 

  sga as a percentage of net sales was 399 percent for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 388 percent for the same 2003 period amortization expense increased to 391 million or 13 percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 109 million or less than 1 percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to amortization expense related to centerpulse and implex finite lived intangible assets in addition during 2004 we continued to introduce or expand strategic programs and activities in 2004 the zimmer institute and its satellite locations were well utilized with over 1400 surgeons trained compared to 500 surgeons trained in 2003 these surgeon training costs are recognized in sga we also recognized approximately 5 million of sarbanesoxley compliance expenses including consultant fees and increased audit fees these increases were partially offset by expense synergies realized from the centerpulse acquisition and controlled spending 

  acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of centerpulse and implex were 811 million compared to 796 million for the same 2003 period and included 244 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses 242 million of integration consulting expenses 94 million of employee severance and retention expenses 78 million of professional fees 52 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members 43 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems 29 million of costs related to relocation of facilities and 29 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses 

   operating profit for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 69 percent to 7632 million from 4507 million in the comparable 2003 period operating profit growth was driven by zimmer standalone sales growth operating profit 

  

contributed by centerpulse effectively controlled operating expenses and the absence of inprocess research and development expense in 2004 compared to 112 million in 2003 these favorable items were partially offset by centerpulse and implex inventory stepup of 594 million in 2004 compared to 427 million in 2003 and intangible asset amortization of 391 million in 2004 versus 109 million in 2003 

  the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to 259 percent for the year ended december 31 2004 from 336 percent for the same period in 2003 a major component of the decrease 47 percent or 345 million was the result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate the major reasons for the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate were the ongoing european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions 

  net earnings increased 57 percent to 5418 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 3463 million in the same 2003 period the increase was due to higher operating profit offset partially by increased interest expense 317 million in 2004 compared to 132 million in 2003 net earnings for 2003 also included a onetime 551 million net of tax noncash cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for instruments net earnings in 2004 also benefited from the decreased effective income tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 percent and 34 percent to 222 and 219 respectively from 167 and 164 in 2003

percent of net sales 

 year ended december 31 2005 

compared to year ended december 31 2004 

  in the americas operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to product category mix and the effective control of operating expenses including realized expense synergies and controlled general and administrative spending 

  european operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to the realization of expense synergies related to the elimination of redundant functions and controlled selling general and administrative spending 

  asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to product category mix lower royalty expenses as a percentage of sales and improved inventory management 

year ended december 31 2004 

compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  in the americas operating profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly due to improved selling prices lower royalty expenses as a percentage of net sales product category mix and controlled operating expenses increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain distributor contracts partially offset these improvements 

  in europe operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to improved selling prices product category mix country sales mix controlled operating expenses and the favorable effect of the centerpulse acquisition country sales mix made favorable contributions as the more profitable german market represented a greater percentage of total europe sales 

  asia pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales declined primarily due to decreased selling prices principally the result of the decrease in government reimbursement rates in japan and increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain dealer contracts in japan 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  cash flows provided by operating activities were 8782 million in 2005 compared to 8622 million in 2004 the principal source of cash was net earnings of 7325 million we experienced 1193 million of positive cash flow related to income taxes during the year ended december 31 2005 primarily due to the utilization of acquired centerpulse tax attributes the utilization of foreign tax credits the realization of certain statelocal tax incentives and exercises of employee stock options operating cash flows from working capital decreased compared to the 2004 period as a result of sales growth payment of acquisition and integration related expenses and resolution of certain legal and product liability matters 

  working capital management continues to be a key focus at december 31 2005 we had 56 days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable favorable to december 31 2004 by 3 days the improvement was achieved through improvement in all reporting segments at december 31 2005 we had 

  

283 days of inventory on hand unfavorable to december 31 2004 by 28 days our inventory levels have increased due to new products higher purchases of raw materials in advance of expected increases of raw material prices and inventory build up to accommodate the austin facility shutdown 

  cash flows used in investing activities were 3111 million in the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 3883 million in 2004 in 2005 we paid 441 million pursuant to the terms of the implex acquisition agreement for contingent earnout payments additions to instruments during the year ended december 31 2005 were 1500 million compared to 1396 million in 2004 increases in instrument purchases were primarily to support new product launches and sales growth in 2006 we expect purchases of instruments to approximate 110 – 115 million as we continue to invest in instruments to support new products sales growth and mis procedures the anticipated decrease in instrument purchases compared to 2005 is the result of high rates of penetration already achieved with mis instruments across our broad base of customers additionally we have been able to successfully insource instruments at a lower cost additions to other property plant and equipment during the year ended december 31 2005 were 1053 million compared to 1008 million in 2004 increases were related to facility expansions in warsaw indiana ponce puerto rico and parsippany new jersey facility expansions were due to increased demand the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites as a result of the closure of the austin texas facility and the tripling of trabecular metal technology production capacity during 2006 we expect purchases of other property plant and equipment to approximate 140 – 150 million as a result of ongoing facility expansions in warsaw indiana new information technology systems and further productivity related investments 

  cash flows used in financing activities were 4846 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 4020 million in 2004 we repaid 5553 million of debt net in the year ended december 31 2005 utilizing cash on hand cash generated from operating activities and 767 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans additionally in december our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program which resulted in the repurchase of 41 million of common stock in 2005 

  we have a five year 1350 million revolving multicurrency senior unsecured credit facility maturing march 31 2010 the “senior credit facility” we had 816 million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december 31 2005 and therefore our available borrowings were 12684 million the 816 million is in japan and carries a low interest rate which is why we have not repaid the debt the senior credit facility contains a provision whereby borrowings may be increased to 1750 million 

  we and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the senior credit facility borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a liborbased rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured longterm credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility at an alternate base rate or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including among other things limitations on consolidations mergers and sales of assets financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 30 to 10 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 35 to 10 if we fall below an investment grade credit rating additional restrictions would result including restrictions on investments payment of dividends and stock repurchases we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2005 commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees including a facility and a utilization fee the senior credit facility is rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services and is not rated by moody’s investors’ service inc 

  we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling 65 million 

  the terms of the implex acquisition include additional cash earnout payments that are contingent on the yearoveryear growth of implex product sales through 2006 we have paid 960 million of earnout payments through december 31 2005 we estimate remaining payments which will occur in 2006 to be in a range from 30 million to 40 million 

  in december our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 1 billion through december 31 2007 as of december 31 2005 41 million of common stock had been repurchased we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under this program 

  management believes that cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and debt service needs should investment opportunities arise we believe that our earnings balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital if necessary 

  

contractual obligations 

 

  we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions 

 critical accounting estimates 

 

  our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

  excess inventory and instruments  – we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost similarly we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workin progress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

  income taxes  – we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense liabilities and reserves we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 

  commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related fees and for claims incurred but not reported we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model the amounts established represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies 

  goodwill and intangible assets  – we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

 

  we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

  we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

  for contracts outstanding at december 31 2005 we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2006 through may 2008 the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december 31 2005 and 2004 were 1142 million and 861 million respectively the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december 31 2005 and 2004 were 195 million and 191 million respectively the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd 126 usd swiss franc 120 usd japanese yen 102 british pound usd 179 usd canadian dollar 122 and australian dollar usd 073 

  we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of our risk management program we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2005 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2009 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 674 million 212 million 200 million 112 million 69 million and 59 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

  we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 1775 million at december 31 2005 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1003 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2005 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency translation gainslosses recognized in earnings under sfas no 52 “foreign currency translation” are generally offset with gainlosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

  we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging we enter into 12 to 24 month supply contracts where available on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk 

 

  in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 

  presently we invest our cash and equivalents in money market and investmentgrade shortterm debt instruments the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

  our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities presently all of our debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2005 a change of 10 percent in interest rates assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would not have a material effect on interest expense however due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no such action nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

  financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

  we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 

  we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

  concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and health care systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

   total knee surgeries typically include a femoral component a patella knee cap a tibial tray and an articulating surface placed on the tibial tray knee replacement surgeries include firsttime joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure knee implants are designed to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint while some knee implant designs called cruciate retaining “cr” designs require the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament other designs called posterior stabilized “ps” designs provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate ligament there are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis the company offers a wide range of products for specialized knee procedures including among others the following brands 

  prolong ™ highly crosslinked polyethylene articular surfaces the prolong polyethylene is a bearing surface material for total knee replacement it is believed to be the only articulating surface product with the ability to claim “resistance to delamination” 

  nexgen ® complete knee solution the nexgen knee product line is a comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had significant application in ps cr and revision procedures the nexgen knee system 

  

offers joint stability and sizing that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components the nexgen knee system provides surgeons with complete and versatile knee instrument options including mis quadsparing ™ and mis miniincision instruments milling and multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument systems the breadth and versatility of the nexgen knee system allows surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during surgery according to the needs of the patient and to support current surgical philosophies the ongoing use of trabecular metal monoblock tibial components in both cr and ps philosophies enhances the company’s strategy to add new innovative technologies to this brand trabecular metal materials provide a dramatically higher level of porosity and surface friction than existing alternatives are similar in stiffness to natural bone and are believed to be a major advancement in orthopaedic materials 

  the nexgen complete knee solution legacy ® kneeposterior stabilized product line provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate ligament the ps capabilities have been augmented through the introduction of the nexgen legacy posterior stabilized flex knee the “lpsflex knee” a highflexion implant that has the potential to safely accommodate knee flexion up to a 155degree range of motion in some patients when implanted using a specialized surgical technique the nexgen lpsflex fixed prolong articular surfaces and femoral implants were released in december 2004 

  the nexgen cr product line is designed to be used in conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament the nexgen crflex fixed bearing knee was added to the product line in 2003 and is designed with components to provide a greater range of motion for patients who require deep bending in their daily activities the nexgen crflex femoral components allow the surgeon to adjust component sizing without removing additional bone 

  the nexgen revision knee product line consists of several different products that are designed to provide clinical solutions to surgeons for various revision situations in 2004 the company commercialized a new bone augmentation implant system made from trabecular metal technology material these new augments are designed to address significant bone loss in revision surgery 

  the naturalknee® system the naturalknee prosthesis system consists of a complete range of interchangeable anatomically designed implants which include several innovative features the company believes cannot be found in other current systems including a proprietary cancellousstructured titanium ™  csti ™ porous coating option for stable fixation in active patients the original naturalknee system will be celebrating its 20th anniversary of clinical use in 2005 new naturalknee ii mis instrumentation was launched in december 2004 these instruments are designed to accommodate a smaller incision during the knee procedure 

  the innex ™ total knee system the innex knee system offers fixed bearing and mobile bearing knee components all designed within the same system philosophy while the innex knee system is best known for its mobile bearing knee offering the availability of differing levels of articular constraint and the innex revision knee components provide for a comprehensive mobile and fixed bearing knee system the innex knee system is currently distributed in europe and asia pacific but is not available for commercial distribution in the united states 

  unicompartmental knee systems the mg® naturalknee ii and allegretto ™ unicompartmental knee systems apply the same flexibility and quality of the company’s other knee implant products to unicompartmental or single compartment disease these systems offer the surgeon the ability to conserve bone by replacing only the compartment of the knee that has had degenerative changes 

  the zimmer® unicompartmental knee system was commercialized in 2004 offering a high flexion design to unicompartmental knee surgery the high flexion design is a patient lifestyle attribute and this product was designed specifically for less invasive surgeries and strengthens the company’s offering in mis procedures and technologies 

  the company has further established itself in the use of minimally invasive knee surgery with the development of minimally invasive instruments for the mg unicompartmental knee system mis miniincision total knee procedures and mis quadsparing total knee procedures have allowed the company to build upon its industry position by offering surgeons the benefits of mis surgery for their total knee procedures the mis miniincision total knee instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues the mis quadsparing total knee procedure features advanced instrument concepts which allow surgeons to perform the total knee arthroplasty through a 710 cm incision without cutting the patient’s muscles or tendons navigation system capability similar to an automotive ground positioning system gps was added by the company in december 2004 as a tool to aid in the placement of the implants during surgery 

   total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis acetabulum of the natural hip hip procedures include first time or primary joint replacement as well as revision procedures for the replacement repair or enhancement of an implant product or component from a previous procedure historically most hip implant procedures have involved the use of bone cement to attach the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone today most of the components used in total hip replacement procedures are porous which means they do not require bone cement because bone can actually grow into and onto the implant surface 

  

  the company’s portfolio of mis techniques includes the mis 2incision ™ hip replacement procedure the miniincision posterior procedure the miniincision anterior procedure and the mis anterolateral single incision technique launched in december 2004 the new anterolateral procedure has the potential to offer similar patient outcomes as the mis 2incision procedure standard implants are used in all mis procedures the incision for a traditional open hip primary replacement may be 12 inches long other less invasive approaches such as a “mini” incision for hips have been in existence for approximately six years in january 2004 the first computer imageguided mis 2incision hip replacement procedure live surgery was performed utilizing new technology and instrumentation codeveloped by the company and its mis technologies computer navigation partner medtronic inc in january 2004 the united states patent and trademark office granted the company a patent specific to the company’s mis 2incision hip replacement procedure and such patent includes 17 approved claims related to the procedure 

  the company’s key hip replacement products include among others 

  versys ® hip system the versys hip system a zimmer flagship brand is supported by a common instrumentation set and is an integrated family of hip products that offers surgeons designspecific options to meet varying surgical philosophies and patient needs the versys hip system includes the following features a variety of stem designs and fixation options for both primary and revision situations a modular design that allows for a variety of femoral heads optimal sizing selections and a common instrumentation set for use with virtually all versys stems

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements 

overview 

 

  zimmer holdings inc is a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants and trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products “osp” orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process the company’s related orthopaedic surgical products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures with operations in more than 24 countries and products marketed in more than 100 countries operations are managed through three reportable geographic segments – the americas europe and asia pacific as used in this discussion the “company” means zimmer holdings inc and its subsidiaries 

  the company believes that the following developments or trends are important to understanding the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2004 

   the centerpulse acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 had a significant impact on financial results for the year ended december 31 2004 centerpulse accounted for 37 percentage points of the company’s 57 percent sales growth for the year ended december 31 2004 in addition for the year ended december 31 2004 the company incurred 811 million of centerpulse and implex acquisition and integration expenses the company’s gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2004 was also impacted by the centerpulse and implex acquisitions as an inventory stepup charge reduced reported gross profit by 594 million 20 percent of sales “inventory stepup” as used herein represents the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired centerpulse and implex inventories sfas no 141 requires the recorded values for acquired inventories to be adjusted from cost to fair value at the date of acquisition based upon estimated sales price less distribution costs and a profit allowance “inventory stepup charges” as used herein represents the amount of noncash expense that is recorded upon the sale of acquired inventories 

  net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of centerpulse were approximately 16 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to an original estimate of 1 million as anticipated only modest synergies were recognized in cost of goods sold during 2004 more significant cost of goods synergies are expected to be recognized in 2005 and 2006 upon depletion of acquired inventories upon completion of the transfer of production from centerpulse’s us manufacturing facility in austin texas to other company manufacturing facilities in warsaw indiana winterthur switzerland and ponce puerto rico and upon completion of the manufacturing portion of the integration plan including for example insourcing forgings and castings operating expense synergies principally in selling general and administrative expenses have exceeded the company’s original expectations reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies however these cost synergies were partially offset by negative sales synergies losses also anticipated and increases in other expenses estimated sales losses including distributor buy backs accounted for as sales returns related to distribution restructuring were 51 million for the year ended december 31 2004 increases in other expenses during 2004 include higher distributor commissions professional fees connected with corporate compliance and training programs and relocation and recruiting to fill open positions net synergies for 2005 are expected to approximate 63 million compared to the company’s original estimate of 56 million net synergies for 2006 are expected to be in excess of 100 million compared to the company’s original estimate of 70 to 90 million 

  the company continues to manage the integration of centerpulse as of december 31 2004 the company has completed over 60 percent of the 3364 scheduled milestones required to execute the entire integration the company has made substantial progress in developing global combined product strategies in integrating the sales and business organizations and in melding essential activities as diverse as global accounting policies and procedures manufacturing processes and email systems during 2004 the company among other things 

 

  

   remaining integration milestones relate primarily to the completion of the manufacturing integration plan including the shutdown of manufacturing operations in austin texas and the insourcing of a variety of formerly outsourced manufacturing functions including forging and casting production in addition to the remaining manufacturing integration milestones other integration activities still to be completed include the establishment of common information technology systems and certain warehouse consolidations the company expects to incur approximately 45 million of integration expenses during 2005 to complete the remaining integration milestones 

  the company completed the acquisition of implex on april 23 2004 during 2004 the company paid approximately 1531 million in initial implex acquisition costs net of cash acquired the acquisition was a culmination of a distribution and strategic alliance agreement relating to the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating trabecular metal technology pursuant to the former distribution and strategic alliance agreement the company sold products incorporating trabecular metal technology prior to the acquisition over 90 percent of implex sales were trabecular metal technology sales to the company therefore the acquisition did not result in the immediate addition of significant new customers or sales for the company post acquisition profit margins on company products incorporating trabecular metal technology also did not immediately improve as these sales consisted primarily of inventory that the company already had on hand at the acquisition date in addition during 2004 the company recorded amortization expense of approximately 4 million related to acquired technology intangible assets therefore the acquisition reduced diluted eps by an estimated 002 for the year ended december 31 2004 the company expects to realize significantly improved future profit margins on trabecular metal technology product sales as it sells inventory manufactured after the acquisition date in addition due to continued strong demand for products incorporating trabecular metal technology the company expects to triple its trabecular metal technology manufacturing capacity which will lead to future sales increases and improved profit margins as a result of manufacturing efficiencies 

   on a pro forma 11 basis volume and mix improvements contributed 9 percentage points of sales growth during the year ended december 31 2004 orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques such as the company’s mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles among other factors in addition the continued shift in demand to premium products such as longevity and durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene liners trabecular metal technology products high flex knees knee and hip revision products and porous hip stems continue to positively impact sales growth for the year ended december 31 2004 primary porous hip stems accounted for 63 percent of all zimmer standalone primary hip stem units sold compared to 46 percent 53 percent and 59 percent of total primary hip stem units sold for zimmer standalone in 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively “zimmer standalone sales” as used herein refers to sales for the period less sales from acquired centerpulse businesses 

  the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the orthopaedics industry the company has made significant progress in the development and introduction of mis procedures and technologies during the year ended december 31 2004 the company trained more than 1400 surgeons at the zimmer institute and its satellite locations in mis techniques including the mis 2incision hip replacement technique and mis quadsparing knee replacement technique during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company estimates that 50 percent and 36 percent of all zimmer standalone us hip and knee sales respectively utilized an mis procedure andor technology 

   in the americas the company’s largest operating segment the company realized pro forma average selling price growth of 4 percent for the year ended december 31 2004 in europe pro forma sales growth reflected flat average selling prices during the year however during the fourth quarter of 2004 european average selling prices decreased approximately 1 percent primarily due to a 6 percent price decrease in germany principally the result of a revised reimbursement system implemented by the german government in the asia pacific operating segment on a pro forma basis the company experienced an average selling price reduction of 2 percent during the year ended december 31 2004 principally the result of the japanese 

 

 

  

government’s biannual change in reimbursement rates pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts group purchasing organizations and potential gain sharing arrangements between surgeons and hospitals may negatively affect the company’s ability to realize global price increases of 23 percent 

   a weakened us dollar during the year ended december 31 2004 compared to last year contributed 4 percentage points sales growth on a pro forma basis the company addresses currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of simple forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited 

   new products which management defines as products introduced within the prior 36month period accounted for 18 percent or 541 million of the company’s sales during the year ended december 31 2004 adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of industry performance sales have grown with the introduction of new products such as prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene for the knee which was introduced in 2002 and represented approximately 49 percent of all cruciate retaining articulating surface product sales and 12 percent of all knee articulating surfaces for the year ended december 31 2004 adoption rates for the company’s new products should continue to favorably affect the company’s operating performance

   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 738 percent in 2004 compared to 728 percent in 2003 and 681 percent for the three month period ended december 31 2003 the first quarter of combined zimmer and centerpulse operations the following table reconciles the gross margin for the year ended december 31 2004 and for the three month period ended december 31 2003 

   decreased centerpulse and implex inventory stepup charges as a percentage of net sales during 2004 594 million or 20 percent of net sales compared to the three month period ended december 31 2003 427 million or 61 percent of net sales and increases in average selling prices were the primary contributors to improved gross margins in addition operating segment mix and product category mix both had a positive impact on gross margins due to higher sales growth in the more profitable americas segment compared to europe and asia pacific higher sales growth of reconstructive implants and the continued shift to premium products offsetting these favorable impacts were a variety of other items including increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange contracts included in cost of products sold partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to automation vertical integration and process improvements 

   rd as a percentage of net sales was 56 percent for years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 rd increased to 1667 million from 1058 million reflecting a full year of centerpulse research and development expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance the company’s pipeline includes 146 projects with a total investment equal to or greater than 1 million of the 146 projects approximately twothirds involve new platforms mis or other technologies for example the company’s orthobiological research group in austin texas is developing innovative solutions for hip fracture and cartilage regeneration during 2004 the company delivered more than 40 major development projects to market the company has strategically targeted rd spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of 46 percent for the industry the company expects over the next few years to invest in research and development at approximately 55 percent to 6 percent of sales 

  sga as a percentage of net sales was 399 percent for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 388 percent for the same 2003 period amortization expense increased to 391 million or 13 percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 109 million or less than 1 percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to amortization expense related to centerpulse and implex finite lived intangible assets in addition during 2004 the company continued to introduce or expand strategic programs and activities in 2004 the zimmer institute and its satellite locations were well utilized with over 1400 surgeons trained compared to 500 surgeons trained in 2003 these surgeon training costs are recognized in sga the company also recognized approximately 5 million of sarbanesoxley compliance expenses including consultant fees and increased audit fees these increases were partially offset by expense synergies realized from the centerpulse acquisition and controlled spending the company has begun to realize synergies from the centerpulse acquisition and expects to pursue additional synergy opportunities the company estimates that over the next two years it will be able to reduce annual sga as a percentage of net sales to 389 percent or lower representing a 200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2003 the first quarter of combined zimmer and centerpulse operations 

  acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of centerpulse and implex were 811 million compared to 796 million for the same 2003 period and included 244 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses 242 million of integration consulting expenses 94 million of employee severance and retention expenses 78 million of professional fees 52 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members 43 million of costs related to integrating the company’s information technology systems 29 million of costs related to relocation of facilities and 29 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses 

   operating profit for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 69 percent to 7632 million from 4507 million in the comparable 2003 period operating profit growth was driven by zimmer standalone sales growth operating profit contributed by centerpulse effectively controlled operating expenses and the absence of inprocess research and development expense in 2004 compared to 112 million in 2003 these favorable items were partially offset by centerpulse and implex inventory stepup of 594 million in 2004 compared to 427 million in 2003 and intangible asset amortization of 391 million in 2004 versus 109 million in 2003 

  the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to 259 percent for the year ended december 31 2004 from 336 percent for the same period in 2003 a major component of the decrease 47 percent or 345 million was the result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate the major reasons 

  

for the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate were the ongoing european restructuring initiatives the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately 24 percent to 125 percent and continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions 

  net earnings increased 57 percent to 5418 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 3463 million in the same 2003 period the increase was due to higher operating profit offset partially by increased interest expense 317 million in 2004 compared to 132 million in 2003 net earnings for 2003 also included a onetime 551 million net of tax noncash cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for instruments net earnings in 2004 also benefited from the decreased effective income tax rate basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 percent and 34 percent to 222 and 219 respectively from 167 and 164 in 2003

including 9 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates and 12 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition knee sales were driven by the nexgen lpsflex knee nexgen trabecular metal technology tibial components and the nexgen cr knee hip sales were driven primarily by the continued conversion to porous stems and sales of trilogy acetabular cups incorporating longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners 

  the following table presents the components of the 2003 over 2002 percentage changes in net sales by product category 

 

  overall worldwide reconstructive implant sales increased 43 percent to 15210 million the 43 percent increase was comprised of a 23 percent increase in zimmer standalone sales and a 20 percent increase due to the centerpulse acquisition knee sales increased 37 percent to 8005 million 24 percent due to increased zimmer standalone sales including 4 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates and 13 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition knee sales were led by the nexgen legacy knee posterior stabilized product line including the lpsflex knee nexgen trabecular metal tibial components and the nexgen cr knee with prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene hip sales increased 46 percent to 6456 million 24 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition and 22 percent due to increased zimmer standalone sales including 5 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates hip sales were driven by continued conversion to porous stems trabecular metal acetabular cups and increased sales of trilogy acetabular cups incorporating longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners dental sales were 298 million reflecting solid growth in both standard and tapered swissplus implants trauma sales increased 13 percent to 1516 million 10 percent due to increased zimmer standalone sales including 3 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates and 3 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition trauma sales were led by sales of the zimmer periarticular plating system spine sales were 336 million due to sales from centerpulse osp sales increased 10 percent including 3 percent due to changes in foreign currency to 1948 million primarily driven by the continued growth of the orthopat orthopedic perioperative autotransfusion system 

  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 728 percent in 2003 compared to 749 percent in 2002 gross profit for 2003 was reduced 427 million or 22 percent of net sales as a result of an inventory stepup charge recognized in connection with the centerpulse acquisition sales and gross profit from centerpulse also reduced reported gross margins as centerpulse has a greater percentage of sales based in europe where gross margins are historically lower than the us and japan increased zimmer standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through automation insourcing and process improvements had positive impacts on gross profit the company’s operating plans annually call for reductions in unit manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result of a number of factors including but not limited to increased volume improvements in material technology replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed equipment changes in the configuration of manufacturing cells designed to increase throughput labor automation as well as insourcing focus on inventory cost reduction is a strategic imperative the company will continue to direct efforts on driving down costs of products sold general and administrative expenses and holding costs associated with working capital 

  research and development as a percentage of net sales was 56 percent in 2003 compared to 59 percent in 2002 as research and development expenses increased 31 percent from the prior year compared to a 39 percent increase in sales research and development expense increased to 1058 million from 807 million reflecting research and development expenses from centerpulse and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance including mis technologies innovative materials such as trabecular metal technology and highly crosslinked polyethylene lifestyle designs revision implants and biological solutions the company has strategically targeted rd spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of 46 percent for the industry maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new products which management defines as products introduced within the prior 36 month period for example in the fourth quarter new product revenue excluding centerpulse represented 189 percent of sales at the high end of the company’s stated quarterly and annual goal of 1520 percent in place since 1999 management expects over the next year or two to continue to invest in rd at almost 6 percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments in spine biologics and new technology increase 

  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” as a percentage of net sales were 388 percent in 2003 compared to 398 percent 394 percent assuming the change in accounting principle for instruments is applied retroactively in 2002 low cost inflation accompanied with double digit revenue growth has driven the overall expense 

 

 

  

ratio lower for the year detailed planning monitoring and control over these expenses have also contributed to the improvement while well managed the company introduced programs and activities in 2003 that involved significant investments which in part are reflected in sga as an example the zimmer institute saw very active use in 2003 the zimmer institute which is used for surgeon training product development activities such as prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for independent field sales representatives provided training for over 500 surgeons physician assistants and nurses on the mis 2incision hip replacement procedure and the mis quadsparing total knee procedure over the course of 2003 the cost of training is borne by the company and reported in sga the acquisition of centerpulse resulted in higher sga as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted sga by 268 million or 14 percent of net sales in 2003 

  acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of centerpulse and incentive were 796 million including 361 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses 154 million of integration consulting expenses 102 million of employee severance and retention expenses 64 million of professional fees 53 million of costs for meetings and activities associated with the initial crosstraining of employees and independent sales representatives 24 million of investment banking fees incurred by centerpulse 20 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members 06 million of employee relocation expenses and 12 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses 

  operating profit increased 12 percent to 4507 million operating profit growth was driven by strong organic sales growth operating profit contributed by centerpulse and effectively controlled operating expenses in addition the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted operating profit by 268 million these favorable items were offset by centerpulse inventory stepup of 427 million centerpulse inprocess research and development writeoffs of 112 million and centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of 796 million 

  the company’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2003 was 336 percent compared to 337 percent in 2002 the decrease from 337 percent to 336 percent was due to expanded operations in puerto rico and the implementation of certain business strategies in 2002 which resulted in reducing taxes in certain jurisdictions and increased credits offset by nondeductible inprocess research and development charges 

  net earnings increased 34 percent to 3463 million from 2578 million in 2002 driven by strong organic sales growth earnings contributed by centerpulse leveraged operating expenses and the onetime noncash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for instruments of 551 million net of tax offset by centerpulse inventory stepup of 280 million net of tax centerpulse inprocess research and development writeoffs of 112 million and centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of 511 million net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share increased 26 percent and 25 percent to 167 and 164 respectively from 133 and 131 in 2002

contractual obligations 

 

  the company has entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments the following table illustrates the company’s contractual obligations 

 critical accounting estimates 

 

  the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below 

  excess inventory and instruments  – the company must determine as of each balance sheet date how much if any of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost similarly the company must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value to determine the appropriate level of reserves the company evaluates current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its products and instrument systems and components the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for workinprogress inventory which is recorded at cost obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 

  income taxes  – the company estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits the company evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the company operates within numerous taxing jurisdictions the company is subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve the company makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense liabilities and reserves the company believes adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 

  commitments and contingencies  – accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims related fees and for claims incurred but not reported an actuarial model is used by the company to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model the amounts established represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies 

  goodwill and intangible assets  – the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the company evaluates the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets changes to these assumptions could result in the company being required to record impairment charges on these assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

 

  the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could impact its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

  the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 

  the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts principally euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars entered into with third parties at december 31 2004 and 2003 were 1052 million and 506 million respectively for contracts outstanding at december 31 2004 the company has an obligation to purchase us dollars and sell euros swiss francs japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2005 through december 2006 the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd 120 usd swiss franc 125 usd yen 110 british pound usd 176 usd canadian dollar 137 and australian dollar usd 065 

  the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities the company’s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of its risk management program the company also performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2004 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2007 depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 621 million 218 million 203 million 63 million 44 million and 37 million for the euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged 

  the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 1860 million at december 31 2004 primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euros approximately 1140 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2004 relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 

  the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency as a result foreign currency translation gains losses recognized in earnings under sfas no 52 “foreign currency translation” are generally offset with gainlosses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 

commodity price risk 

 

  the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging the company enters into 12 to 24 month supply contracts where available on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices as part of the company’s risk management program sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk 

 

  in the normal course of business the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities 

  presently the company invests its cash and equivalents in money market and investmentgrade shortterm debt instruments the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 

  the company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with its credit facilities the company is subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities presently all of its debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon the company’s overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2004 a change of 10 percent in interest rates or 25 basis points assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would result in an annual increase of interest expense of approximately 10 million however due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no such action nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

credit risk 

 

  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 

  the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and equivalents and investments 

  the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

  concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of the company’s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and health care systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements the company works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered and identified although the company does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by the company in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of the company’s products or incorporate unique technology the company does not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse effect on its financial and operational performance to date the company has not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill its production schedules intellectual property

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements 

overview 

  the company is a global leader in the design development manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants including joint and dental spinal implants and trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees hips shoulders and elbows dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural healing process the company’s related orthopaedic surgical products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures with operations in more than 24 countries and products marketed in more than 80 countries operations are managed through three reportable geographic segments – the americas europe and asia pacific   events affecting operating performance in 2003 centerpulse results of operations have been included in the company’s results subsequent to the completion of that acquisition on october 2 2003 and their respective assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values in the company’s consolidated statement of financial position as of october 2 2003 with the excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill the pending acquisition of implex gives the company enhanced flexibility in the development of products using trabecular metal technology which the company believes has significant potential in orthopaedic reconstructive and spinal product applications   the company continues to make significant progress in the development and introduction of mis procedures and technologies this includes the continued rollout of the zimmer mis 2 incision hip replacement procedure and the development of the mis quadsparing total knee procedure that the company introduced at the 2004 american academy of orthopaedic surgeons meeting in san francisco the company believes such innovative approaches will significantly impact the orthopaedics industry since its opening in march 2003 the zimmer institute in warsaw indiana has seen extensive use for mis education new product development meetings and sales training programs during the year the company continued to expand the zimmer institute’s global affiliations   with the acquisition of centerpulse the company begins an exciting new chapter in its history the successful integration of the centerpulse business which began in the fourth quarter is the company’s critical objective for the near term more than 100 full time personnel from zimmer centerpulse and independent professional service organizations are managing more than 275 major integration projects for over 80 legal entities in 80 different countries the integration process under the direction of the company’s senior management team continues to advance the company has made substantial progress in developing global combined product strategies in integrating the company’s us sales and european business organizations and in melding essential activities as diverse as global accounting principles and email systems during the year the company recorded 796 million pretax of acquisition and integration costs for contract terminations professional fees employee severance retention pay employee relocation costs and other expenses in 2004 the company expects to incur another 1280 million for similar costs and expenses as integration progresses   the company’s operating results in the fourth quarter the first quarter for which it reported combined results indicated that the acquisition of centerpulse was accretive to our shareholders excluding acquisition and integration expenses inprocess rd writeoff and inventory stepup the company’s combined gross margin in the fourth quarter including an inventory stepup charge of 427 million was 681 percent directly related to geographic and product mix price and strong manufacturing performance the company believes that its reported gross margin for the fourth quarter which reflects the combination with centerpulse and the consequently higher european revenue content remains strong other important financial metrics include the company’s level of spending on research and development and its selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales the company expects over the next couple of years to continue to invest in research and development at almost 6 percent of sales as investments in spine biologics and new technology increase in management’s view the company’s selling general and administrative expenses are well managed closing out the fourth quarter at 409 percent of revenue   despite the strong operating performance in the fourth quarter the company expects to realize approximately 50 million in sales dissynergies in 2004 the company believes it is possible given the complexity of the centerpulse combination that its reconstructive revenue growth in europe for example may lag the european reconstructive market as the company works through integration challenges in key markets such as france italy and germany   economic and industry wide factors relevant to the company on a worldwide basis price improvement has remained firm at 34 percent in the last two years the company realized better than expected growth in average 

 

   

selling prices at 4 percent in its most recent quarter in the americas the company’s largest operating segment although the industry has experienced steady growth in price in the last few years the company expects price growth to moderate in the near term and settle in at rates of 23 percent for 2004 pressure from healthcare cost containment efforts may affect prices in markets where health care spending grows at a rate higher than the local economy even though the clinical benefits of joint replacement products and fixation devices are well documented the orthopaedic industry could be subject to such efforts by various consumers of healthcare in different parts of the world in japan as an example where hospital reimbursement prices for medical devices are set by the ministry of health labor and welfare the company expects pricing to decline 46 percent in mid to late 2004 as compared with the more traditional 24 percent decline experienced in prior biannual price adjustments another important factor affecting the industry is global demand for orthopaedic devices orthopaedic procedure volume on a worldwide basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population proven clinical benefits new material technologies advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles among other factors   adoption rates for new technologies are another key indicator of industry performance in the company’s business revenue has grown with the introduction of new products such as longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners which accounted for 11 percent of the company’s total liner sales in its first year of introduction and now comprises over 90 percent of the company’s liner sales the centerpulse companion product durasul ® highly crosslinked polyethylene was up 47 percent in the fourth quarter crosslinked polyethylene products generally demand a higher price than standard liners due to anticipated improvement in wear characteristics as demonstrated in laboratory tests in 2002 the company introduced prolong crosslinked polyethylene for the knee which is also sold at a premium to standard articulating surfaces in the fourth quarter prolong represented approximately 42 percent of all cruciate retaining articulating surface product sales and 14 percent of all articulating surfaces while the price premium is significant on this product the company believes its ultimate impact of resistance to delamination has potentially far ranging medical and economic benefits adoption rates for the company’s new products associated with crosslinked polyethylene mis procedures and technologies trabecular metal knee and hip revision products interpositional knee devices and new trauma spine and dental devices will continue to affect the company’s operating performance   in recognition of the importance of the successful introduction of new technologies zimmer has developed a full time department called – “health technology assessment and reimbursement” this department has supported the collection and analysis of clinical data to determine the economic effects of certain surgical procedures and the use of the company’s products   another important factor affecting operating performance is foreign currency fluctuations with a significant portion of the company’s revenue derived from sales of its products outside of the united states revenues and operating results are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations a weakening us dollar throughout 2003 contributed to the growth in revenue reported in the year ended december 31 2003 adding four percent of the 20 percent reported revenue growth excluding centerpulse product revenue the company addresses currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization through the use of derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited   an evolving trend which may affect the industry and the company’s operating performance in the future is connected with how the industry markets its products industry players have recently turned to directtoconsumer dtc advertising and promotion as a means of promoting new products and technologies as this development is in its beginning stages it is not possible to predict how this may affect operating performance if at all in the future the company has engaged in relatively lowcost dtc campaigns in connection with the launch of its nexgen lpsflex knee and to publicly reach out to patients while working with surgeons to introduce mis technologies and procedures the company has made use of the zimmerowned web site pacewithlifecom which in 2003 resulted in 38000 “find a doc” requests and almost 10000 marketing packets mailed and the company’s mis “adword” campaigns had more than 30000 “clickthru’s” on nearly one million impressions the company’s six month national public relations campaign in 2003 completed the year with almost 170 placements and reached audiences of close to 15 million people while certain competitors are now engaged in more expensive national advertising the company is currently satisfied with the returns it has experienced with its lowcost dtc campaigns   lastly among the many factors that affect operating performance within the industry is the development and protection of intellectual property in 2003 the company was granted a patent by the us patent and trademark office for the zimmer mis 2incision hip replacement procedure the patent includes 17 approved claims in addition to the issued patent five more zimmer mis 2incision hip procedure patents are pending with a total of 122 additional claims identified relating to the surgical technique and instrumentation similarly and equally important the us patent and trademark office has issued patents for the company’s transformational technology mis hip fracture fixation system with 22 product and procedure claims approved and five patents and 239 claims outstanding furthermore the company has seven patents pending related to its unique mis “quadsparing” or “qs” total knee procedure with a total of 395 claims covering novel aspects of the procedure and instrumentation as well as new implant designs the company believes there is significant potential

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

  the following table presents the components of the yearoveryear percentage changes in net sales by geographic segment  

  net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 39 percent to 19010 million sales growth was driven by strong demand for the company’s reconstructive implants and additional sales from the october 2 2003 centerpulse acquisition the 39 percent increase was comprised of a 20 percent increase in zimmer standalone sales and a 19 percent increase due to the centerpulse acquisition “zimmer standalone sales” as used herein refers to sales for the period less sales from acquired centerpulse businesses favorable demographics including an aging population and a continued shift to premium priced products contributed to the favorable volume and mix growth higher average selling prices were realized in all three geographic segments the continued weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and the japanese yen were the main contributors to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales   net sales in the americas for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 30 percent to 12083 million sales growth was driven by strong demand for the company’s reconstructive implants and additional sales from the centerpulse acquisition the 30 percent increase was comprised

and 8 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition hip sales increased 27 percent to 3656 million 21 percent due to increased zimmer standalone sales and 6 percent due to the centerpulse acquisition knee sales growth was led by the nexgen legacy kneeposterior stabilized product line including the lpsflex knee the nexgen trabecular metal technology tibial components the nexgen cr knee with prolong crosslinked polyethylene and the nexgen rotating hinge knee hip sales growth was driven by the continued conversion to porous stems including significant growth of the versys hip system fiber metal

zimmer periarticular plating system spine sales were 336 million due to sales from centerpulse orthopaedic surgical product sales increased 10 percent 7 percent constant currency to 1948 million primarily driven by the continued growth of the orthopat orthopedic perioperative autotransfusion system   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 728 percent in 2003 compared to 749 percent in 2002 gross profit for 2003 was reduced 427 million or 22 percent of net sales as a result of an inventory stepup charge recognized in connection with the centerpulse acquisition sales and gross profit from centerpulse also reduced reported gross margins as centerpulse has a greater percentage of sales based in europe where gross margins are historically lower than the us and japan increased zimmer standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through automation insourcing and process improvements had positive impacts on gross profit the company’s operating plans annually call for reductions in unit manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result of a number of factors including but not limited to increased volume improvements in material technology replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed equipment changes in the configuration of manufacturing cells designed to increase throughput labor automation as well as insourcing focus on inventory cost reduction is a strategic imperative the company will continue to direct efforts on driving down costs of products sold general and administrative expenses and holding costs associated with working capital   research and development as a percentage of net sales was 56 percent in 2003 compared to 59 percent in 2002 as research and development expenses increased 31 percent from the prior year compared to a 39 percent increase in sales research and development expense increased to 1058 million from 807 million reflecting research and development expenses from centerpulse and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance including mis technologies innovative materials such as trabecular metal and highly crosslinked polyethylene lifestyle designs revision implants and biological solutions the company has strategically targeted rd spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of 46 percent for the industry maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new products which management defines as products introduced within the prior 36 month period for example in the fourth quarter new product revenue excluding centerpulse represented 189 percent of sales at the high end of the company’s stated quarterly and annual goal of 1520 percent in place since 1999 management expects over the next year or two to continue to invest in rd at almost 6 percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments in spine biologics and new technology increase   selling general and administrative expenses “sga” as a percentage of net sales were 388 percent in 2003 compared to 398 percent 394 percent assuming the change in accounting principle for instruments is applied retroactively in 2002 low cost inflation accompanied with double digit revenue growth has driven the overall expense ratio lower for the year detailed planning monitoring and control over these expenses have also contributed to the improvement while well managed the company has introduced programs and activities in 2003 that involve significant investments which in part are reflected in sga as an example the zimmer institute has seen very active use in 2003 the zimmer institute which is used for surgeon training product development activities such as prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for independent field sales representatives provided training for over 500 surgeons physician assistants and nurses on the mis 2 incision hip replacement procedure and the 

 

 

   

mis quadsparing total knee procedure over the course of 2003 the cost of training is borne by the company and reported in sga the acquisition of centerpulse resulted in higher sga as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted sga by 268 million or 14 percent of net sales in 2003   acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of centerpulse and incentive were 796 million including 361 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses 154 million of integration consulting expenses 102 million of employee severance and retention expenses 64 million of professional fees 53 million of costs for meetings and activities associated with the initial crosstraining of employees and independent sales representatives 24 million of investment banking fees incurred by centerpulse 20 million of personnel expenses and travel for fulltime integration team members 06 million of employee relocation expenses and 12 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses   operating profit increased 12 percent to 4507 million operating profit growth was driven by strong organic sales growth operating profit contributed by centerpulse and effectively controlled operating expenses in addition the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted operating profit by 268 million these favorable items were offset by centerpulse inventory stepup of 427 million centerpulse inprocess research and development writeoffs of 112 million and centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of 796 million   the company’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2003 was 336 percent compared to 337 percent in 2002 the decrease from 337 percent to 336 percent was due to expanded operations in puerto rico and the implementation of certain business strategies in 2002 which resulted in reducing taxes in certain jurisdictions and increased credits offset by nondeductible inprocess research and development charges   net earnings increased 34 percent to 3463 million from 2578 million in 2002 driven by strong organic sales growth earnings contributed by centerpulse leveraged operating expenses and the onetime noncash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for instruments of 551 million net of tax offset by centerpulse inventory stepup of 280 million net of tax centerpulse inprocess research and development writeoffs of 112 million and centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of 511 million net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share increased 26 percent and 25 percent to 167 and 164 respectively from 133 and 131 in 2002 year ended december 31 2002 compared to year ended december 31 2001

orthopaedic surgical product sales increased by 8 percent increased 9 percent constant currency to 1769 million led by the continued growth of the orthopat orthopedic perioperative autotransfusion system   gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 749 percent in 2002 compared to 727 percent in 2001 which included separation costs of 119 million or 12 percent of sales the increase was attributable to increased average selling prices realized in all segments the continued conversion from cemented hip implants to higher margin porous products increased penetration of longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners higher sales of revision implants and various manufacturing improvements the company upgraded its automated foundry process for casting knee femorals hip stems and cups an increased number of products were moved to robotic polishing as well as additional porous knee femorals converted to the fiber metal laser welding process several products previously purchased from

  working capital continues to be a key management focus at december 31 2003 the company had 62 days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable unfavorable to the prior year by 10 days acquired centerpulse businesses had a negative impact of 10 days due to centerpulse’s business mix which has a greater proportion of european revenue with payment terms generally longer than those in the us at december 31 2003 the company had 232 days of inventory on hand compared to 247 days reported at the end of 2002 the reduction was principally due to improved inventory management and the acquired dental and spinal businesses carrying fewer days of inventory 

 

   

  cash flows used in investing activities were 11027 million in 2003 compared with 357 million in 2002 the increase was principally due to the centerpulse and incentive acquisitions which included cash payments to former centerpulse and incentive shareholders of 11871 million and cash payments for direct acquisition costs of 372 million offset by cash acquired of 2966 million during june 2003 the company acquired the transfx external fixation system product line from immedica inc for 148 million in addition the january 1 2003 change in accounting principle for instruments resulted in the

  the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in swiss francs japanese yen euro canadian dollars and australian dollars the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major international financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings   the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts principally japanese yen euro canadian dollars and australian dollars entered into with third parties at december 31 2003 and 2002 were 506 million and 252 million respectively for all contracts outstanding at december 31 2003 the company has an obligation to purchase us dollars and sell japanese yen euro canadian dollars and australian dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january 2004 through december 2005 the weighted average contract rates for 2004 and 2005 are yenusd 116 and 115 usdeuro 106 and 111 canadian dollarusd 141 and 143 and usdaustralian dollar 064 and 062 respectively   the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities the company’s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of its risk management program the company furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2003 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the japanese yen euro canadian dollar and australian dollar with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 252 million 219 million 49 million and 49 million for the yen euro canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged   the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 1775 million and 135 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively primarily in swiss francs japanese yen and euro approximately 1333 million of the net asset exposure at december 31 2003 relates to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments as a result of the exchange offers commodity price risk 

  the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum polymer and sterile packaging the company enters into 12 to 24 month supply contracts where available on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices as part of the company’s risk management program sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

   

interest rate risk 

  in the normal course of business the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities   presently the company invests its cash and equivalents in money market and investmentgrade shortterm debt instruments the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio   the company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the shortterm rates associated with its credit facilities the company is subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities presently all of its debt outstanding bears interest at shortterm rates the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon the company’s overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2003 a change of 10 percent in interest rates or 23 basis points assuming the amount outstanding remains constant would result in an annual increase of interest expense of approximately 25 million however due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no such action nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment presently the company intends to utilize cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings credit risk 

  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable   the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and equivalents and investments   the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties   concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of the company’s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and health care systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk

polishing as well as additional porous knee femorals converted to the fiber metal laser welding process several products previously purchased from outside suppliers were moved in house for production investments in high speed machining and new tooling technologies made improvements in reducing both product cycle times and scrap lastly standardization of the company’s manufacturing processes resulted in improvement in efficiency   research and development as a percentage of net sales was 59 percent in 2002 compared to 61 percent in 2001 or 58 percent excluding separation costs of 32

percentage of net sales were 398 percent in 2002 compared to 456 percent in 2001 or 409 percent excluding separation costs of 549 million selling general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent to 5460 million in 2002 from 4822 million excluding separation costs of 549 million in 2001 excluding separation costs the improvement in the expense ratio reflects lower selling expenses as a result of lower costs associated with the company’s us distributor network sales force and distributor reorganization in japan and improved efficiency in the utilization of instruments this was partially offset by approximately 2 million of consulting costs associated with tax services and analysis of various external development opportunities continued investments in various strategic initiatives including mis directtoconsumer advertising training and medical education and higher insurance premiums   operating profit increased 62 percent in 2002 to 4009 million from 2483 million in

earnings before taxes decreased to 337 percent in 2002 compared to 378 percent in 2001 or 358 percent excluding separation costs the decrease from 358 percent to 337 percent was due to expanded

europe this increase was comprised of a 14 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales a 3 percent increase due to higher average selling prices and a 4 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations   the introduction of new materials techniques and technologies has contributed to a significant increase in demand for the company’s products and has generally had a favorable effect on sales as average selling prices for the new materials and technologies generally exceed those being replaced for example sales have been favorably affected by a market shift from cruciate retaining designs to posterior stabilized designs for total knee procedures the company maintains a relatively strong market position in posterior stabilized knees sales have also benefited from a market shift from cemented components to higher priced porous components for total hip replacements introduction of the zmr revision hip system provided the company with a more comprehensive offering in a market subcategory that is reported to experience a higher growth rate than primary hip replacements   introduction of the prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene articular surface for total knee replacement procedures exemplifies the company’s continued use of innovative materials and technologies and follows the successful introduction of the longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liner for total hip replacement procedures the market acceptance of the longevity polyethylene liner which commands premium prices in most markets over the standard polyethylene liner has been rapid   net sales in the americas increased 21 percent to 7907 million compared to 2000 this increase was comprised of a 16 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales together with a 5 percent increase due to higher average selling prices sales of reconstructive implants increased 25 percent with strong sales in all categories

cups and increased sales of trilogy acetabular system cups incorporating longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners trauma product sales increased 11 percent in large part due to the introduction of the new zps internal fixation devices during the fourth quarter and increased sales in fracture instruments   net sales in asia pacific decreased 4 percent to 2552 million compared to 2000 this decrease was comprised of an 8 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales which was more than offset by a 12 percent decrease due to foreign exchange

stabilized flex knee introduced recently in the americas hip sales increased by 15 percent increased 19 percent constant currency to 3766 million driven by continued conversion to porous hip stems strong sales of trilogy cups incorporating longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and the continuing introduction of the zmr revision hip system trauma product sales increased 4 percent

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

market risk 

  the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices that could impact its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and on a limited basis through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes foreign currency exchange risk 

  the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally on a combined basis which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major international financial institutions these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions for periods consistent with commitments realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings   the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts principally japanese yen and the euro entered into with third parties at december 31 2002 and 2001 were 252 million and 82 million respectively for all contracts outstanding at december 31 2002 the company has obligation to purchase us dollars and sell japanese yen and the euro at set maturity dates ranging from january 2003 through september 2004 the weighted average contract rates for 2003 and 2004 are 129 and 117 yen and 097 and 103 euro respectively   the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities the company’s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions on this basis with respect to cash flow hedges changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments as part of its risk management program the company furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue operating results cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2002 indicated that if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the japanese yen and the euro with no change in the interest differentials the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes depending on the direction of the change by an average approximate amount of 171 million and 99 million for the yen and euro contracts respectively any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction consequently foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and transactions being hedged   the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately 135 million and 87 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively primarily in the japanese yen and the euro commodity price risk 

  the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome titanium tantalum medical grade polymer and sterile packaging the company enters into 12 to 24 month supply contracts on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices as part of the company’s risk management program sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed a 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows interest rate risk 

  in the normal course of business the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities   presently the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in money market and investmentgrade shortterm debt instruments the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk currently the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio   the company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with its credit 20  

facilities the company is subject to movements in interest rate risk on the committed credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities presently all of its debt outstanding is floating the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure but may do so in the future based upon the company’s overall interest rate exposure as of december 31 2002 a change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company’s earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period however due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no such action nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes further this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment presently the company intends to utilize cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings credit risk 

  financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash cash equivalents counterparty transactions and accounts receivable   the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and investments   the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business however this loss is limited to the amounts if any by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties   concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business however essentially all of the company’s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors who operate in international markets and accordingly are exposed to their respective business economic and country specific variables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and health care systems exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk 21
