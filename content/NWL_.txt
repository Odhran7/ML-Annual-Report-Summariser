coronavirus covid19 

the covid19 pandemic which began in late 2019 has continued to disrupt the company’s global operations similar to those 

of many large multinational corporations in three primary areas 

supply chain of its 135 manufacturing and distribution facilities approximately 20 were temporarily closed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 the most significant of which were its south deerfield massachusetts home fragrance plant its mexicali mexico and india writing facilities and its juarez mexico connected home and security facility all of which were closed in accordance with applicable government guidelines the majority of the company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities reopened during the second and third quarter of 2020 and have since been operating at or near capacity with inventory levels replenished the company does however continue to face significant product supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and logistical challenges across its businesses including port congestion constrained shipping container availability and delays in carrier pickup which have negatively impacted the companys ability to satisfy demand for its products creating order backlog in a number of categories the company also continues to face significantly higher than expected inflation for commodities primarily resin sourced finished goods transportation and labor which had a negative highsingledigitpercentage impact to costs of products sold for 2021 these various disruptions are expected to persist at least in the nearterm to help mitigate the negative impact of inflation to the operating performance of its businesses the company has secured selective pricing increases accelerated productivity initiatives and deployed overhead cost containment efforts 

retail while the company’s largest retail customers experienced a surge in sales as their stores remained open a number of secondary customers primarily in the specialty and department store channels temporarily closed their brick and mortar doors in march 2020 and began to reopen in certain regions where conditions improved towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 these dynamics in combination with some retailers’ prioritization of essential items have had a meaningful impact on the companys traditional order patterns in addition the company temporarily closed its yankee candle retail stores in north america as of midmarch of 2020 due to covid19 these stores reopened by the end of the third quarter of 2020 and have remained open since 

consumer demand patterns during the quarantine phase of the pandemic in 2020 consumer purchasing behavior strongly shifted to certain focused categories certain of the company’s product categories benefited from this shift primarily in food commercial and home appliances some of the company’s other businesses were negatively impacted but have seen positive momentum with an increase in demand post lockdowns in particular writing baby and home fragrance while the seasonality of its businesses reverted to historical trends in 2021 uncertainty still remains over the volatility and direction of future consumer demand patterns 

the company believes the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys future sales operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition will continue to be driven by numerous evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market including severity and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and work restrictions operational or travel bans have been reinstituted the rate at which vaccines are administered to the general public the timing and amount of fiscal stimulus and relief programs packages that may become available to the general public in the future and any changes in consumer demand patterns for the companys products as the impact of the global pandemic lessens 

with the spread of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level on whether to reinstate andor extend certain initiatives previously implemented to help contain the spread of covid19 and currently plans to mandate vaccinations for its us employees

raw materials and sourced finished goods 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities although the company did experience capacity constraints around certain raw materials and finished goods in 2021 driven by global conditions including continued demand volatility related to the covid19 pandemic which are expected to continue into 2022 the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate glass plastic expanded polystyrene extinguisher powder nylon paper plastic resin sawdust tin plate wax and wood natural rubber electrical components glass fiber magnesium adhesives various paperrelated packaging materials and metals including steel stainless steel aluminum and copper the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester

manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all the finished goods for a product line in particular certain businesses within the company’s learning and development segment rely on thirdparty manufacturers for substantially all of their products specifically the baby business unit has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of its sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

sales of the company’s products tend to be seasonal with sales operating income and operating cash flow in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter the seasonality of the company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation amortization rent personnel costs and interest expense impacts the company’s results on a quarterly basis in addition the company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments customer program payments working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers 

the companys sales and operating results were disrupted by the covid19 pandemic negatively impacting the companys performance during the first half of 2020 with improved performance thereafter while the seasonality of its businesses reverted back to historical patterns in 2021 uncertainty still remains over the volatility of the direction of future consumer demand patterns

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors and ecommerce retailers the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory and ecommerce retailers have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through pricing 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers reducing current inventory levels demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with the company’s products the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished our yankee candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers including department stores gift stores and national specialty retailers that sell candles 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery and producing and procuring products at a competitive cost in addition the company has an experienced management team that focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers’ needs the companys service and delivery levels in 2021 were negatively impacted by product supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and logistical challenges across its businesses all of which the company expects to continue in 2022 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailers including discount druggrocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores contract stationers and ecommerce retailers the company’s largest customer walmart inc and subsidiaries “walmart” accounted for approximately 15 of net sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 amazon the companys second largest customer accounted for approximately 13 12 and 9 of net sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the company’s topten customers in alphabetical order in 2021 included amazon bed bath  beyond costco kroger lowe’s office depot staples target the home depot and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

ownership of the company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to invest in the company’s securities the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks that are currently unknown to the company or that the company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

covid19 related risks 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of the covid19 pandemic or any other disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be unfavorably impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic or any other disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to cease particular activities these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness store closures school closures or delayed opening for schools and other higher education programs quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship among customers retailers and consumers shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty in planning our operations which may adversely impact our results liquidity and financial condition 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets or cost inflation due to disruptions or shortages in our manufacturing operations supply arrangements as well as distribution centers caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability including as a result of governmental mandates to close certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties which may adversely impact our operations liquidity and financial condition or 

• significant changes in the political and labor conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our manufacturing distribution research and development and retail facilities restrict our employees’ ability or willingness to 

travel or perform necessary business functions or require employees and business partners to work remotely creating potential for risks related to cybersecurity confidentiality and data privacy breaches or otherwise prevent our facilities or our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could adversely impact our results liquidity and financial condition or 

• the duration and sustainability of any improvements in covid19 conditions which will be uncertain as continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions such as our returntooffice plans may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information and may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations to the extent that the company mandates vaccinations for its employees as the company currently plans for its us workforce it is not possible to predict with certainty the exact impact on us or on our workforce any such company mandates could result in employee attrition which could materially adversely affect future revenues and costs and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control in this regard the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operating results cash flows liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic its impact on the us and global economies and the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental plans to administer vaccines to the general public especially in areas where new variants have emerged conditions have worsened and lockdowns or travel bans are reinstituted 

industry and economic risks 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large omnichannel and ecommerce retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished a proliferation of digitally native brands has further intensified the competitive landscape the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores specialty retailers wholesalers commercial distributors directtoconsumer channels and ecommerce retailers the dominant share of the market represented by these large retailers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns and the integration of brick and mortar and ecommerce operations at major retailers has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory omnichannel and ecommerce retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers these retailers have and may continue to foster high levels of competition among suppliers reduce inventory levels demand innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique specifications require suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and require product delivery with shorter lead times retailers have imported and may continue to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the traditional retail and ecommerce sectors may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could materially adversely affect the company’s sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over time the company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets reduce inventory and rationalize their supply chain which could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in additional increase in the customers negotiating power with suppliers as well as pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins 

strategic and operational risks 

the company’s sales are dependent on purchases by several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the company’s future financial performance 

the company’s customer base is relatively fragmented although the company has longestablished relationships with many customers the company generally does not have any longterm supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers purchase commitments by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders as a result these customers may cancel their orders change purchase quantities from forecast volumes delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship significant or numerous cancellations reductions delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition because many of the company’s costs are fixed a reduction in customer demand due to decreased sales to end consumers could have an adverse effect on the company’s gross profit margins and operating income the retail landscape in many of the company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may adversely affect the company’s relationships with its key retailers whereby the number of products it sells will no longer be a reliable indicator of the amount of future business the company can expect 

the company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large highvolume retail customers however the company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to 

• reduce lead times for product delivery which may require the company to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales 

• improve customer service such as with direct import programs whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from thirdparty suppliers and 

• adopt technologies related to inventory management such as radio frequency identification otherwise known as rfid technology which may have substantial implementation costs 

the company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers or that customer demand will remain consistent a substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers and an inability to adapt to the emergence of alternative retail channels could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand the company’s ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line 

extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend over the long term its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the companys advertising and promotion expense has increased in 2021 and the company plans to increase such expenditures along with other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term these initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

failure to further expand the company’s ecommerce business despite increasing ecommerce investments may materially and adversely affect the company’s market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail industry has rapidly evolved and consumers have embraced shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase has accelerated at the same time the portion of retail business at traditional “brick and mortar” stores and shopping centers is decreasing 

the company’s strategy includes investments in ecommerce omnichannel and technology initiatives if these investments fail to adequately or effectively allow the company to further expand its ecommerce business maintain or grow its overall market position or otherwise benefit the company the company’s market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of sales by the company’s other customers which could if not offset by a greater increase in ecommerce sales materially adversely affect the business of the company 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce omnichannel and technology investments may adversely impact the company’s financial performance in the short and longterm there can be no assurance that investments in ecommerce and omnichannel infrastructure and technology will result in increased sales through ecommerce or otherwise 

the company’s plans to execute its turnaround plan improve productivity reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would materially adversely affect its financial results 

the company is executing a turnaround plan to build a global next generation consumer products company that can unleash the full potential of its brands in a fastmoving omnichannel environment the company is implementing various global initiatives in connection with the turnaround plan to reduce costs and improve cash flows for example during the third quarter of 2021 the company announced project ovid a multiyear customer centric supply chain initiative to transform its gotomarket capabilities in the us improve customer service levels and drive operational efficiencies these initiatives are designed to reduce the complexity of the organization improve the company’s cash conversion cycle and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms these initiatives are further designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics among other things these initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated other major productivity streamlining and divestment programs may also be required in the future to continue the turnaround plan such programs may require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other initiatives and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results further the company has pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties the company’s success depends on its ability to integrate such acquired brands businesses or technologies to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies to reduce supply chain costs and to streamline and redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion future acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or significant integration and transaction costs 

the company’s operations are dependent upon thirdparty vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the company’s business operations 

the company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties the company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products 

the ability of thirdparty suppliers to timely deliver finished goods andor raw materials and the ability of the company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns demand volatility or port congestion unavailability of shipping containers or other equipment or significant weather and health conditions affecting manufacturers andor shippers any adverse change in the company’s relationships with its thirdparty suppliers the financial condition of thirdparty suppliers the ability of thirdparty suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis or the company’s ability to import products from thirdparty suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in particular the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to the operations of certain suppliers and the related transportation of their goods to the united states that are parts of our global supply chain we have been able to make alternative delivery arrangements for limited quantities of goods at increased cost however we have experienced shortages in supply and if they were to be prolonged or expanded in scope there could be resulting supply shortages that could materially and adversely impact our ability to manufacture and to deliver our products to our customers accordingly such supply shortages and delivery limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the financial condition of the company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations for example certain businesses in the baby business unit have a single source of supply for products that comprises a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products any inability of the company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the company the company may not be able to quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose and it may be difficult to retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its thirdparty suppliers the company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products 

a cyberattack or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology “it” systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

• ordering and managing materials from suppliers 

• converting materials to finished products 

• shipping products to customers 

• marketing and selling products to consumers 

• collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data including data that may be subject to data privacy laws including but not limited to the general data protection regulation of the european union “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” or general law for protection of personal data “lgpd” of brazil 

• processing transactions 

• summarizing and reporting results of operations 

• hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business plans and financial information 

• complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements 

• providing data security and 

• handling other processes necessary to manage the company’s business 

increased it security threats and cybercrime including advanced persistent threats computer viruses ransomware other types of malicious code hacking phishing and social engineering schemes designed to provide access to the company’s networks or data pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data as an example in 2021 a remote code execution vulnerability in apache log4j was identified 

as affecting large amount of systems worldwide cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them the company deploys technical and organizational measures to protect and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data however as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventive measures furthermore the company’s relationships with and access provided to third parties and their vendors may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventive measures or fully mitigating harms after an attack or breach occurs 

the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems notwithstanding whether the company takes reasonable steps to prevent such attacks the company’s operations especially its retail operations involve the storage and transmission of employees’ customers’ and consumers’ personal and sensitive information such as credit card and bank account numbers the company’s payment services may be subject to credit card and other payment fraud schemes including unauthorized use of credit cards debit cards or bank account information identity theft or merchant fraud if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches or the inability to effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations a risk of government enforcement action litigation and possible liability and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 the ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 and the lgpd which went into effect in august 2020 the changes introduced by the gdpr ccpa and lgpd increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices 

the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inflation changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services as well as the impact of tariffs 

we are currently experiencing inflationary pressures on our operating costs among other things competition for labor is becoming more acute and we have experienced increased labor costs as a result in addition we have experienced increased costs from suppliers and for the transportation of our products there is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset any cost increases through cost reduction programs or price increases of our products especially given the competitive environment if we generally are not able to sufficiently increase our pricing to offset these increased costs or if increased costs and prolonged inflation continue it could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and profitability sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost 

in addition the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to or mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials finished goods energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products during periods of rising prices of raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers conversely when raw material prices decline customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and to the extent the company has existing inventory lower margins as a result fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the products the company manufactures require particular types of glass metal paper plastic resin wax wood or other materials supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the company’s products pricing and availability of finished goods raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control including general 

domestic and international economic conditions natural disasters labor costs production levels competition consumer demand import duties and tariffs currency exchange rates international treaties and changes in laws regulations and related interpretations 

specifically evolving trade policies could continue to make sourcing products from foreign countries difficult and costly as the company sources a significant amount of its products from outside of the united states given the companys reliance upon nondomestic suppliers any significant changes to the united states trade policies and those of other countries in response may cause a material adverse effect on its ability to source products from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results continued tariffs on chineseorigin goods or on certain products imported into the united states or any extension of tariffs to additional categories of goods or to additional importers or exporters or additional countries of origin could significantly increase the cost of some our products and reduce our margins while the company will continue to work to mitigate the tariff exposure there can be no assurance that the companys mitigation efforts will be successful 

unfavorable shifts in industrywide demand for the company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk 

the company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities impairment of value and obsolescence this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers sales team and management if inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving appropriate writedowns may be recorded in addition the company writes off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand product design changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions which eliminate demand for existing products remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate net realizable market value 

if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company’s estimates inventory writedowns may be required the company cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for its products will not affect it beyond the inventory charges that have already been recorded 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key talent 

the company’s ability to successfully execute its turnaround plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key leaders the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified talent in 2021 the company hired a president ecommerce and digital and a new chief accounting officer competition for such talent is intense 

the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel global competition for such personnel is intense and has increased in the recent past amidst emerging labor trends including but not limited to increased remote work options there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate retain or otherwise develop internally other highly qualified personnel in the future 

damage to the company’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on the company’s business  

maintaining the company’s strong reputation with consumers customers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the company’s continued success adverse publicity about the company its brands corporate practices or any other issue that may be associated with the company whether or not deserved could jeopardize that reputation such adverse publicity could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the company or its brands 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk if third parties fail to comply with our policies and procedures or similar compliance requirements set forth by our customers the company could potentially suffer significant losses of business and revenue from certain customers 

further third parties sell counterfeit versions of some of our products which are often inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity 

finally there has been an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters from time to time the company announces certain initiatives regarding its focus areas which may include environmental matters diversity inclusion and belonging sustainability packaging responsible sourcing and social investments in 2021 the company published its corporate citizenship report which included updates on many of these focus areas and goals for certain areas the company could fail or be perceived to fail in its achievement of such initiatives and goals or it could fail in accurately reporting its progress on such initiatives and goals in addition the company could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters the company’s reputation and business could be negatively impacted by such developments or litigation may be filed against the company resulting in significant expenses or investments to repair such impacts 

damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s brands could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to repair the harm 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact the company’s global business 

at december 31 2021 the company had approximately 32000 employees worldwide a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute the company periodically negotiates with certain unions and labor representatives and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all 

risks related to the strength of global retail commercial and industrial sectors and changes in foreign cultural political and financial market conditions could impair the company’s international operations and financial performance 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe latin america and the asia pacific region these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn can be affected by specific events or general economic conditions including worldwide or countryspecific economic instability 

continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside of the us and potential volatility in domestic andor foreign equity markets may result in considerable pressure on consumer demand which may have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions such events could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

further some of the company’s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed or where economies have suffered economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls may not be sustainable and as a result the company’s sales or profits related to those countries may decline the economies of other foreign countries important to the company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation in the future the company’s international operations and particularly its business in emerging markets including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of the company’s customers are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the company including among other things 

• protectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing sales or import and export of the company’s products including tariffs and countermeasures 

• new restrictions on access to markets 

• lack of developed infrastructure 

• inflation including hyperinflation or recession 

• devaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies 

• changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws accounting standards trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws 

• social political or economic instability 

• acts of war and terrorism 

• natural disasters or other crises 

• reduced protection of intellectual property rights 

• restrictions on transfer of funds andor exchange of currencies 

• expropriation of assets or forced relocations of operations and 

• other adverse changes in policies including monetary tax andor lending policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by host countries 

in addition our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics which could harm our business and cause our operational results to suffer for example the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our revenues in the first half of 2020 and the eventual duration and financial impact of the pandemic are still uncertain 

further the united kingdom exited the european union on january 31 2020 after protracted political and economic negotiations with a transition period lasting until december 31 2020 following the termination of the transition period the united kingdom and the european union entered into a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the future relationship between the parties which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 and entered into force on may 1 2021 following ratification by the european union the trade agreement offers united kingdom and european union businesses preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the united kingdom and the european union will now be on more restricted terms than before and there remains uncertainty around the postbrexit regulatory environment 

as a result of brexit the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted including a decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the us dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease their volume of orders or cancel orders completely 

brexit may also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

should any of these risks occur the company’s ability to manufacture source sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired in addition the company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations andor the company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets 

financial risks 

the company has substantial indebtedness which could materially and adversely affect the company and its financial position including decreasing its business flexibility impacting its ratings and increasing its borrowing costs 

at december 31 2021 the company had 49 billion in outstanding debt reflecting a reduction of approximately 721 million versus december 31 2020 the company’s substantial indebtedness has and could continue to have important consequences for the company including 

• requiring the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which reduces the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchases of the company’s common stock and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to adverse business and economic conditions or changes in the company’s business and the industries in which it operates 

• placing the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and 

• limiting along with the financial and nonfinancial covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

in addition if the company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness the company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debttocapitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios lower its credit ratings result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company going forward 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

while the majority of the company’s debt is fixed fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on the company’s 

business indeed increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and cash flows in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate nine times since december 2015 including four times in 2018 each time by a quarter of a percentage point before reducing interest rates in 2019 three times in response to the covid19 pandemic the us federal reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate to 0 in march 2020 before voting in november 2020 to keep shortterm interest rates anchored in a range between 0 and 025 after holding rates constant in 2021 to support its policy of pandemic relief on december 15 2021 the us federal reserve signaled a reversal in policy with at least three interest rate raises expected in 2022 to help curb inflationary pressures the policy statements and decisions of the us federal reserve are uncertain and subject to change depending on economic conditions any change in the fiscal policies or stated target interest rates of the us federal reserve or other central banking institutions or market expectations of such change are difficult to predict and may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness 

an increase in interest rates or borrowing costs may also occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the contemplated transition away from the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark reference for shortterm interest rates such a transition may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt the us federal reserve has sponsored the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” which serves as a forum to coordinate and track planning as market participants currently using libor consider a transitioning to alternative reference rates where it is deemed appropriate and b addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that libor might stop on april 3 2018 the us federal reserve began publishing three new reference rates including the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” sofr is observed and backward looking which stands in contrast with libor under the current methodology which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk as is the case with libor sofr is therefore likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions arrc has recommended sofr as the alternative to libor and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment and a paced transition plan to sofr use the financial stability board has taken an interest in libor and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate such as libor ceases publication the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in july and august 2018 isda also published a protocol providing details of the fallback rate conversion methodology in october 2020 it cannot be predicted whether sofr or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces libor and if so the effects on our future results of operations or financial condition in october 2021 we entered into a suspension of rights agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent for the lenders on the credit agreement dated december 18 2018 the “credit agreement” related to our revolving credit facility under the suspension of rights agreement we agreed that borrowings in gbp eur and cad or with an interest period that uses 2month usd libor will not be available without consent of the required lenders until the credit agreement is amended to provide for an alternative benchmark rate to replace libor any such borrowings would be deemed to be amended to select usd as the currency or to have selected to use 1month usd libor as the interest period these uncertainties regarding the possible cessation of libor or their resolution and our current inability to borrow in foreign currencies could adversely impact our interest expense funding costs net interest margin loan and other asset values assetliability management strategies and other aspects of our business and financial results 

reductions in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly the company’s cost of capital the company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations the credit ratings assigned to the company also impact the interest rates paid on short and longterm financing 

on november 1 2019 sp global inc “sp” downgraded the company’s debt rating to “bb” as sp believed the company would fail to meet sp’s target debt level for 2019 in addition on march 9 2020 moody’s corporation “moody’s” downgraded the company’s debt rating to “ba1” based on a view that the company would fail to meet moodys target debt level for 2020 as a result of the sp and moodys downgrades certain of the company’s outstanding senior notes were subject to an interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points for each downgrade totaling 50 basis points in addition the company’s ability to borrow from the commercial paper market on terms it deemed acceptable or favorable was eliminated and its cost of borrowing increased 

on february 11 2022 sp global inc “sp” upgraded the company’s debt rating to “bbb” from “bb” as sp believed the company has been able to achieve sp’s target debt level as a result of this upgrade the company will again be in a position to 

access the commercial paper market and the interest rates on certain of its outstanding senior notes will be reduced by 25 basis points on an annualized basis however any future downgrade by sp below “bbb” or further downgrade by moody’s would further increase the company’s borrowing costs and continue to adversely affect the company’s financial results in addition in the event of a future reduction in credit rating the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be further lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market 

the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

see liquidity and capital resources in item 7  

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and our failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition 

the company is required by the sec to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 

the company has experienced and in the future may experience again material weaknesses along with potential problems implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls failure to maintain effective internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls could result in our inability to conclude that the company has effective internal control over financial reporting if the company cannot meet its financial reporting obligations in a timely and reliable manner or prevent fraud the public perception of the company and its securities may be harmed and it may be unable to raise capital on favorable terms in the future or otherwise which could have a negative impact on the companys financial condition 

continued declines in the future expected cash flows for the company’s businesses or changes to underlying assumptions used to calculate fair value could result in additional impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results of operations 

the company is required under us gaap to review its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are also required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an otherthantemporary impairment exists 

during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the company recorded noncash impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles of 60 million 15 billion and 12 billion respectively in continuing operations and 112 million in discontinued operations in 2019 future events or factors may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events or factors may include but are not limited to divestitures of certain businesses or product lines strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price in the event any such impairment indicators become known or are present the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future given the company’s recent history of impairment charges there is minimal difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of some of its intangible assets increasing the possibility of future impairment charges see critical accounting estimates in item 7 and footnotes 1 and 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the reporting currency for the company’s financial statements is the us dollar and it has substantial assets liabilities revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than us dollars the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires translation of those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency these translations could result in significant changes to the company’s results of operations from period to period although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition foreign currency transaction risk arises when the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions where the settlement occurs in a currency other than its functional currency exchange differences gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they arise although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction risk including the hedging of forecasted cash inflows and outflows it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company may decide to sell or discontinue certain businesses or product lines in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit on february 6 2022 the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its chs business unit to resideo technologies inc for a purchase price of 593 million subject to customary working capital and transaction adjustments this transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022 subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval 

divestitures or discontinuations of businesses or products may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing past and future divestitures and business discontinuations also involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel 

• the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture 

• the disruption of the company’s business 

• the potential loss of key employees and 

• disputes or litigation with the buyers 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

legal tax and regulatory risks 

governmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the company’s business operations 

the company is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations as further described in footnote 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is also subject to third party litigation the potential outcomes of thirdparty litigation if insured could exceed policy limits resulting in significant costs and expenses the company could be responsible for any settlement or judgment over the amount of available insurance coverage or for the entire settlement or judgment if not insured in the ordinary course of business the company is also subject to formal and informal regulatory and governmental examinations subpoenas requests for documents testimony or information inquiries investigations threatened legal actions and proceedings the company previously disclosed that it had received a subpoena and related informal document requests from the us securities 

and exchange commission the “sec” primarily relating to its sales practices and certain accounting matters for the time period beginning from january 1 2016 see footnote 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information the company also received a subpoena relating to disclosures on the potential impact of us treasury regulations in june 2021 as further described below responding to governmental investigations voluntary document requests subpoenas or actions by regulatory bodies may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to the company’s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the company’s business operations 

the company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental data privacy competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us may not be taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

on june 18 2019 the us treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” released temporary regulations under irc section 245a “section 245a” as enacted by the 2017 us tax reform legislation “2017 tax reform” and irc section 954c6 the “temporary regulations” to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 tax reform was enacted on august 21 2020 the us treasury and irs released finalized versions of the temporary regulations collectively with the temporary regulations the “regulations” the regulations seek to limit the 100 dividends received deduction permitted by section 245a for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations before the retroactive application of the regulations the company benefited in 2018 from both the 100 dividends received deduction and the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income the company analyzed the regulations and concluded the relevant regulations were not validly issued therefore the company has not accounted for the effects of the regulations in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending december 31 2021 the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company if the company’s position on the regulations is not sustained the company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately 180 million to 220 million related to an income tax benefit from fiscal year 2018 that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time in addition the company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company on june 30 2021 the company received a subpoena from the sec requesting the production of documents related to its disclosure of the potential impact of the us treasury regulations as further described in footnote 11  income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions internationally significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

the company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 

in addition to operational standards environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to investigate andor clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such activities often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination accordingly the company may be liable either contractually or by operation of law for investigation andor remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the company is a landfill or other location where it has disposed of wastes or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the company’s ownership or operation of the property given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the company and others at these properties there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted the company does not believe that any of the company’s existing obligations including at thirdparty sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect upon its business results of operations or financial condition however future events such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown contamination may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material see “environmental matters” in footnote 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other environmentalrelated matters 

the company’s business involves the potential for product recalls product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition 

as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products the company is subject to the us consumer products safety act of 1972 as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 which empowers the us consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions under certain circumstances the consumer products safety commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products additionally other laws and agencies such as the national highway traffic safety administration regulate certain consumer products sold by the company in the united states and abroad and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future from time to time the company has announced voluntary recalls of its products where it has identified potential product safety concerns any repurchase or recall of the company’s products could be costly and damaging to the company’s reputation when the company is required to remove or voluntarily removes its products from the market the company’s reputation could be tarnished and the company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell the company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage bodily injury or other adverse effects 

in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products similar to product liability claims the company faces exposure to class action lawsuits related to the performance safety or advertising of its products such class action suits could result in substantial monetary judgments and injunctions related to the sale of products and could potentially tarnish the company’s reputation 

although the company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable that insurance is in most cases subject to significant selfinsured retentions for which the company is responsible and the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms if at all in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage the company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged product defects other than personal injury or property damage additionally the company does not maintain product recall insurance and may not have insurance coverage for claims asserted in consumer class action lawsuits that seek monetary compensation unrelated to personal injury andor property damage such as claims related to the marketing or warranty of the product as a result product recalls product liability claims and other productrelated claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards however compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk as a result these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrencebased program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance the company currently either selfinsures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company’s individual per occurrence selfinsured retention the company cannot give assurance however that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to selfinsured retention will not be material see footnote 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigationrelated matters 

if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products which could adversely affect the company’s market share and results of operations 

the company’s success with its proprietary products depends in part on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights including its patent trade secret and trademark rights if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products 

the company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products the company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products the company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge and potentially invalidate any existing or future patents that the company receives or licenses in addition patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company’s products 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impaired 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such intellectual property in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if rights holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business the company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products or services even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

climate change and increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations and customers on sustainability issues including those related to climate change may adversely affect our business and financial results 

certain scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts floods wildfires and other climatic events increased frequency of extreme weather could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products at these locations increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also be a direct threat to our thirdparty vendors service providers or other stakeholders including disruptions of supply chains or information technology or other necessary services for our company 

federal state and local governments as well as some of our customers are beginning to respond to climate change issues this increased focus on sustainability is resulting in new legislations regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as those used in the company’s supply chain could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

more specifically legislative or regulatory actions related to climate change could adversely impact the company by increasing our energy costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades any of these factors could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs in addition revenues could decrease if we are unable to meet regulatory or customer sustainability requirements these additional costs changes in operations or loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

coronavirus covid19 

the covid19 pandemic which began in late 2019 has continued to disrupt the company’s global operations similar to those 

of many large multinational corporations in three primary areas 

supply chain of its 135 manufacturing and distribution facilities approximately 20 were temporarily closed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 the most significant of which were its south deerfield massachusetts home fragrance plant its mexicali mexico and india writing facilities and its juarez mexico connected home and security facility all of which were closed in accordance with applicable government guidelines the majority of the company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities reopened during the second and third quarter of 2020 and have since been operating at or near capacity with inventory levels replenished the company does however continue to face significant product supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and logistical challenges across its businesses including port congestion constrained shipping container availability and delays in carrier pickup which have negatively impacted the companys ability to satisfy demand for its products creating order backlog in a number of categories the company also continues to face significantly higher than expected inflation for commodities primarily resin sourced finished goods transportation and labor which had a negative highsingledigitpercentage impact to costs of products sold for 2021 these various disruptions are expected to persist at least in the nearterm to help mitigate the negative impact of inflation to the operating performance of its businesses the company has secured selective pricing increases accelerated productivity initiatives and deployed overhead cost containment efforts 

retail while the company’s largest retail customers experienced a surge in sales as their stores remained open a number of secondary customers primarily in the specialty and department store channels temporarily closed their brick and mortar doors in march 2020 and began to reopen in certain regions where conditions improved towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 these dynamics in combination with some retailers’ prioritization of essential items have had a meaningful impact on the companys traditional order patterns in addition the company temporarily closed its yankee candle retail stores in north america as of midmarch of 2020 due to covid19 these stores reopened by the end of the third quarter of 2020 and have remained open since 

consumer demand patterns during the quarantine phase of the pandemic in 2020 consumer purchasing behavior strongly shifted to certain focused categories certain of the company’s product categories benefited from this shift primarily in food commercial and home appliances some of the company’s other businesses were negatively impacted but have seen positive momentum with an increase in demand post lockdowns in particular writing baby and home fragrance while the seasonality of its businesses reverted to historical trends in 2021 uncertainty still remains over the volatility and direction of future consumer demand patterns 

the company believes the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys future sales operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition will continue to be driven by numerous evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market including severity and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and work restrictions operational or travel bans have been reinstituted the rate at which vaccines are administered to the general public the timing and amount of fiscal stimulus and relief programs packages that may become available to the general public in the future and any changes in consumer demand patterns for the companys products as the impact of the global pandemic lessens 

with the spread of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level on whether to reinstate andor extend certain initiatives previously implemented to help contain the spread of covid19 and currently plans to mandate vaccinations for its us employees

results of operations 

consolidated operating results 2021 vs 2020 



nm — not meaningful

gross profit for 2021 increased 7 and gross profit margin declined to 311 as compared with 328 in the prior year period the increase in gross profit was driven by gross volume leverage gross productivity and favorable net pricing partially offset by significant input cost inflation for commodities primarily resin sourced finished goods transportation and labor which had a negative highsingledigitpercentage impact to costs of products sold the gross margin decline reflected in part a timing lag between inflation and the full impact of responsive pricing actions changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted gross profit by 30 million or 1

the company has entered into agreements for certain right of use operating leases that it has not yet taken possession of and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2021 the total future obligations of these right of use operating leases have been excluded from the preceding table and are approximately 130 million see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 457 million in unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2021 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the company’s most critical accounting policies which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations are described below 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and are recognized at a point in time which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms which is also when control is transferred the company’s primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of its consumer and commercial products to its customers 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services certain customers may receive cash andor noncash incentives such as cash discounts returns credits or reimbursements related to defective products customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other customerrelated programs which are accounted for as variable consideration in some cases the company applies judgment including contractual rates and historical payment trends when estimating variable consideration 

in addition the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment due 

to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue the company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost the company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for i contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and ii contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the company has the right to invoice for services performed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter on december 1 or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant on december 1 2021 the carrying values for total goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were 35 billion and 23 billion respectively 

goodwill 

goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units reporting units are determined based upon the company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level the company’s operations are comprised of eight reporting units within its five primary operating segments 

the quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and the estimation of future cash flows business growth rates terminal values discount rates and total enterprise value the income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on fiveyear cash flow projections the cash flows projected are analyzed on a debtfree basis before cash payments to equity and interestbearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit a provision is made based on these projections for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period or terminal value the present value of the finiteperiod cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate the company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting its latest projections which included among other things the impact of significant input cost inflation for commodities primarily resin sourced finished goods 

transportation and labor on its operations at the time the company performed its impairment testing 

there was no goodwill impairment recorded in conjunction with the company’s annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter and as of december 31 2021 there were no reporting units with fair values within 10 of the associated carrying values additionally a hypothetical 10 reduction in forecasted earnings before interest taxes and amortization used in the discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 

see footnotes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

indefinitelived intangibles 

the testing of indefinitelived intangibles primarily trademarks and tradenames under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as cash flow projections royalty rates terminal values and discount rates an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired by the amount its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value for impairment testing purposes the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is determined using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method the relief from royalty method estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset the excess earnings method estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual or excess cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present the excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital tangible assets and other intangible assets changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 in connection with its annual impairment testing the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 29 million and 31 million associated with tradenames in the commercial solutions and learning and development segments respectively as their carrying values exceeded their fair values reflecting a downward revision of future expected cash flows which include the impact of the covid19 global pandemic an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would have resulted in increased impairment charges of approximately 1 million and 7 million respectively the remaining value of these tradenames were 5 million and 47 million respectively 

the remaining tradenames within the companys commercial solutions and learning and development segments with no impairment during the fourth quarter of 2021 impairment test had carrying values of 523 million and 436 million respectively and fair values in excess of 10 of carrying values an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these remaining tradenames would not have resulted in an impairment charge 

there were no impairments of the company’s tradenames within the home appliances home solutions and outdoor and recreation segments during the fourth quarter of 2021 impairment test the carrying value of tradenames within these segments were 58 million 10 billion and 119 million respectively and fair values in excess of 10 of the carrying values an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would not have resulted in an impairment charge 

at december 31 2021 all remaining indefinitelived tradenames had fair values in excess of 10 of their associated carrying values 

see footnotes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company believes the circumstances and global disruption caused by covid19 may continue to affect its businesses future operating results cash flows and financial condition and that the scope and duration of the pandemic is highly uncertain in addition some of the other inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates industry growth credit ratings foreign exchange rates and inflation for commodities sourced finished goods transportation and labor given the uncertainty of these factors as well as the inherent difficulty in predicting the severity and duration of the covid19 global pandemic and associated recovery and the uncertainties regarding the potential financial impact on the companys business and the overall economy there can be no assurance that the companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 

the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets which were based on facts and circumstances known at this time it is however possible that new events may occur or actual events may result in forecasted cash flows revenue and earnings that differ from those that formed the basis of the company’s estimates and assumptions actual results could be materially different from the company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value for each of the company’s reporting units if the global pandemic caused by covid19 continues to persist for an extended period of time if such a scenario were to occur the company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets the company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment the company may be required to perform additional impairment testing based on further deterioration of the global economic environment continued disruptions to the company’s business further declines in operating results of the company’s reporting units andor tradenames further sustained deterioration of the company’s market capitalization and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity experiences a sustained deterioration from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment operating leases and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group early termination of an operating lease a significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group the company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available with the exception of the yankee candle business where testing is performed at the retail store level see footnotes 6 7 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

income taxes 

the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors the pension and postretirement obligations are measured at december 31 2021 and 2020 

the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of pension plan assets the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us largecapitalization stocks us smallcapitalization stocks and international securities investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

the expected longterm rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations historical asset returns current and expected future market conditions risk and active management premiums the target asset allocations for the company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan in part due to plan demographics funded status and liability duration in general the company’s target asset allocations are as follows global equities approximately 10 to 30 fixed income approximately 70 to 90 and cash alternative investments and other approximately zero to 10 at december 31 2021 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions the company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans the asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile at december 31 2021 the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows equities approximately 19 and other investments alternative investments fixedincome securities cash and other approximately 81 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions 

for 2021 2020 and 2019 the actual return on plan assets for the company’s us pension plan assets was approximately 48 million 178 million and 213 million respectively versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately 51 million 59 million and 59 million respectively the actual amount of future contributions will depend in part on longterm actual return on assets and future discount rates pension contributions for all the company’s pension plans for 2022 are estimated to be approximately 18 million as compared to the 2021 contributions of approximately 20 million 

the weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2021 was approximately 36 for the company’s pension plans the weighted average discount rate at the 2021 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 23 and 23 respectively a 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2021 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately 58 million 

the healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers at december 31 2021 the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 62 the current healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decrease to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 45 see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in general business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices which can affect the cost of operating investing and financing under those conditions the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks the company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt as such the company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs at december 31 2021 approximately 100 million of the company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps the remainder of the debt approximately 48 billion carries a fixed rate of interest based upon the company’s debt structure at december 31 2021 a hypothetical 1 increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately 1 million and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 283 million 

while the company transacts business principally in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars a substantial portion of the company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies such as the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar european euro japanese yen and mexican peso changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses for 2021 approximately 35 of the company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies the most significant of which were european euro approximately 9 british pound approximately 6 and canadian dollar approximately 4 the primary purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives 

the company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials as such the company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the company enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials a hypothetical 10 change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the company’s results of operations in this sensitivity analysis all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments all of which are highly rated institutions however the company does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

coronavirus covid19 

beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2019 through 2020 and into 2021 covid19 emerged and subsequently spread globally ultimately being declared a pandemic by the world health organization the pandemic resulted in various federal state and local governments as well as private entities mandating restrictions on travel and public gatherings closure of nonessential commerce stay at home orders and quarantining of people to limit exposure to the virus the companys global operations similar to those of many large multinational corporations experienced significant covid19 related disruption to its business in three primary areas 

• supply chain while the majority of the company’s factories are considered essential in their applicable jurisdictions and have remained operational the company experienced disruption at certain of its facilities of its 135 manufacturing and distribution facilities approximately 20 were temporarily closed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 the most significant of which were its south deerfield ma home fragrance plant its mexicali mexico and india writing facilities and its 

juarez mexico connected home and security facility all of which were closed in accordance with state government guidelines by the end of the third quarter of 2020 substantially all of the companys manufacturing and distribution facilities reopened and were operating at or near capacity since then the companys facilities have replenished most of the inventory levels that were depleted by lost production during the temporary closure period the company does however continue to face intermittent supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and transportation and logistical challenges and expects this to persist until the current economic and public health conditions improve globally 

• retail while the company’s largest retail customers experienced a surge in sales as their stores remained open a number of secondary customers primarily in the specialty and department store channels temporarily closed their brick and mortar doors in march 2020 and began to reopen in certain regions where conditions improved towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 these dynamics in combination with some retailers’ prioritization of essential items have had a meaningful impact on the companys traditional order patterns in addition the company temporarily closed its yankee candle retail stores in north america as of midmarch all of these stores reopened by the end of the third quarter and have remained open since 

• consumer demand patterns during the quarantine phase of the pandemic consumer purchasing behavior strongly shifted to certain focused categories while certain of the company’s product categories in the food commercial and appliances and cookware business benefited from this shift others particularly the writing business experienced significant slowing changes in consumer purchasing patterns temporary office closures as well as the shift to remote learning for schools and other higher education programs in the fall semester of 2020 adversely impacted the performance of the writing business during 2020 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the company focused on protecting the health and wellbeing of its employees maintaining financial viability and business continuity and keeping manufacturing facilities and distribution centers operating where permitted and deemed prudent to provide products to our consumers the company put in place internal protocols including the establishment of a covid19 task force to monitor the situation as well as communications and guidance issued by foreign federal state and local governments the company instituted mandatory workfromhome policies for employees able to work from home in various locations around the world and implemented a number of precautionary measures at its manufacturing plants warehouses distribution centers and rd centers to reduce persontoperson contact and improve the personal safety for our frontline employees furthermore the company temporarily closed all of the worldwide yankee candle retail stores by the end of the third quarter of 2020 all of the company’s temporarily closed manufacturing and distribution sites reopened and were operating at or near capacity in addition most of the companys office locations have reopened on a limited basis 

the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level to evaluate possible cessation or extensions to all or part of such covid19 precautionary initiatives as part of the companys efforts to contain costs and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility it instituted a hiring freeze for nonessential roles furloughed all fieldbased and most corporate retail employees in north america from april 1 2020 through the third quarter of 2020 tightened discretionary spending reduced nonessential travel and optimized advertising and promotional expenses in addition the company announced a restructuring program during the second quarter of 2020 to reduce overhead costs streamline certain underperforming operations and improve future profitability 

while the negative effects from the covid19 global pandemic in the first half of 2020 were material to the companys operating results the company saw positive momentum which included sales growth during the second half of the year and strong liquidity with over 14 billion in operating cash flow for the year ended december 31 2020 the company believes however the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic to its businesses operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic the impact of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental plans to administer vaccines to the general public especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and lockdowns or travel bans have been reinstituted those primary drivers are beyond the companys knowledge and control and as a result at this time it is difficult to predict the cumulative impact both in terms of severity and duration covid19 will have on its future sales operating results cash flows and financial condition furthermore the impact to the companys businesses operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition may be further adversely impacted if the covid19 global pandemic continues to exist or worsens for a prolonged period of time or if plans to administer vaccines are delayed

raw materials and sourced finished goods 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities although the company did experience capacity constraints around certain raw materials and finished goods in 2020 driven largely by demand volatility related to the covid19 pandemic the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate glass plastic expanded polystyrene extinguisher powder nylon paper plastic resin sawdust tin plate wax and wood natural rubber electrical components glass fiber magnesium adhesives various paperrelated packaging materials and metals including steel stainless steel aluminum and copper the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester 

the company also relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods historically the company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs for a limited number of product lines a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all the finished goods for a product line in particular certain businesses within the company’s learning and development segment rely on thirdparty manufacturers for substantially all of their products specifically the baby business unit has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of its sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

sales of the company’s products tend to be seasonal with sales operating income and operating cash flow in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter the seasonality of the company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation amortization rent personnel costs and interest expense impacts the company’s results on a quarterly basis in addition the company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments customer program payments working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers 

in 2020 the companys sales and operating results were disrupted by the covid19 pandemic negatively impacting the companys performance during the first half of the year partially offset by positive performance during the second half of the year the company believes the seasonality of its businesses will revert back to historical patterns as the impact of the global pandemic lessens

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through pricing 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers reducing current inventory levels demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with the company’s products the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished our yankee candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers including department stores gift stores and national specialty retailers that sells candles

 item 1a risk factors 

ownership of the company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to invest in the company’s securities the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks that are currently unknown to the company or that the company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

covid19 related risks 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of the covid19 pandemic or any other disease outbreak including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be unfavorably impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid19 pandemic or any other disease outbreak epidemic pandemic or similar widespread public health concern such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to cease particular business activities these impacts include but are not limited to 

• significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness store closures school closures or delayed opening for schools and other higher education programs quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship among customers retailers and consumers shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty in planning our operations which may adversely impact our results liquidity and financial condition 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations supply arrangements as well as distribution centers caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability including as a result of governmental mandates to close certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties which may adversely impact our operations liquidity and financial condition or 

• significant changes in the political and labor conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our manufacturing distribution research and development and retail facilities restrict our employees’ ability or willingness to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our facilities or our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could adversely impact our results liquidity and financial condition 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control in this regard the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operating results cash flows liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic its impact on the us and global economies and the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental plans to administer vaccines to the general public especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and lockdowns or travel bans have been reinstituted 

we have experienced significant covid19related disruptions to our businesses and if we experience future disruption in the neartomedium term we may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants or borrowing base requirements in certain of our debt facilities  

under the terms of certain of our debt facilities including the securitization facility and credit revolver we are required to comply with certain financial covenants or satisfy certain borrowing basis requirements as a result of the covid19 pandemic our operations have been and could be further disrupted and if such disruptions significantly interfere with our operations in the neartomedium term we may be not be able to satisfy such requirements in such a situation we may choose to seek covenant waivers or other relief from the lenders under our debt facilities 

covenant waivers may result in additional fees associated with obtaining the waiver or our being subject to increased interest rates additional restrictive covenants and other lender protections under our debt facilities our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities including the granting of security interests in collateral will be limited by the existing restrictions applicable to the company under the various documents governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain future waivers in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all if we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities if and when necessary we could be in default of such agreements which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract liabilities in such a situation we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities if we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver in the future under any one or more of these debt facilities there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities as a result the inability to obtain covenant waivers described above would have a material adverse effect on the company 

industry and economic risks 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished a proliferation of digitally native brands has further intensified the competitive landscape the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores specialty retailers wholesalers commercial distributors directtoconsumer channels and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large retailers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers reducing inventory levels demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could materially adversely affect the company’s sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades the company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets reduce inventory and rationalize their supply chain which could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in future pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins 

strategic and operational risks 

the company’s sales are dependent on purchases by several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the company’s future financial performance 

the company’s customer base is relatively fragmented although the company has longestablished relationships with many customers the company generally does not have any longterm supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers purchase commitments by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders as a result these customers may cancel their orders change purchase quantities from forecast volumes delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship significant or numerous cancellations reductions delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition because many of the company’s costs are fixed a reduction in customer demand due to decreased sales to end customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s gross profit margins and operating income the retail landscape in many of the company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may adversely affect the company’s relationships with its key retailers whereby the number of products it sells will no longer be a reliable indicator of the amount of future business the company can expect 

the company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large highvolume retail customers however the company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to 

• reduce lead times for product delivery which may require the company to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales 

• improve customer service such as with direct import programs whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from thirdparty suppliers and 

• adopt technologies related to inventory management such as radio frequency identification otherwise known as rfid technology which may have substantial implementation costs 

the company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers or that customer demand will remain consistent a substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers and an inability to adapt to the emergence of alternative retail channels could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand the company’s ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend over the long term its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

failure to further expand the company’s ecommerce business despite increasing ecommerce investments may materially and adversely affect the company’s market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail industry has rapidly evolved and consumers have embraced shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase has accelerated at the same time the portion of retail business at traditional “brick and mortar” stores and shopping centers is decreasing 

the company’s strategy includes investments in ecommerce and investments in technology initiatives if these investments fail to adequately or effectively allow the company to further expand its ecommerce business maintain or grow its overall market position or otherwise benefit the company the company’s market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of sales by the company’s other customers which could if not offset by a greater increase in ecommerce sales materially adversely affect the business of the company 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments may adversely impact the company’s financial performance in the short and longterm there can be no assurance that investments in ecommerce infrastructure and technology will result in increased sales through ecommerce or otherwise 

the company’s plans to execute its turnaround plan improve productivity reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would materially adversely affect its financial results 

the company is executing a turnaround plan to build a global next generation consumer products company that can unleash the full potential of its brands in a fastmoving omnichannel environment the company is implementing various global initiatives in connection with the turnaround plan to reduce costs and improve cash flows these initiatives are designed to reduce the complexity of the organization improve the company’s cash conversion cycle and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms these initiatives are further designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics among other things these initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated other major productivity streamlining and divestment programs may also be required in the future to continue the turnaround plan such programs may require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results further the company has pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties the company’s success depends on its ability to integrate such acquired brands businesses or technologies to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies to reduce supply chain costs and to streamline and redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion future acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or significant integration and transaction costs 

the company’s operations are dependent upon thirdparty vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the company’s business operations 

the company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties the company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products in some cases the company does not enter into longterm contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers instead buying parts and products on a “purchase order” basis as a result the company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 

the ability of thirdparty suppliers to timely deliver finished goods andor raw materials and the ability of the company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns demand volatility or port congestion unavailability of shipping containers or other equipment or significant weather and health conditions affecting manufacturers andor shippers any adverse change in the company’s relationships with its thirdparty suppliers the financial condition of thirdparty suppliers the ability of thirdparty suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis or the company’s ability to import products from thirdparty suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial condition of the company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations for example certain businesses in the baby business unit have a single source of supply for products that comprises a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products as another example certain products manufactured by the connected home and security business unit rely upon a single source for a key component part and alternative sources for that component part are limited should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply temporarily close their factories as a result of government mandates or other circumstances go out of business or discontinue a particular component the company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner if at all any inability of the company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the company the company cannot assure you that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose and the company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its thirdparty suppliers the company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products 

a cyberattack or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology “it” systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

• ordering and managing materials from suppliers 

• converting materials to finished products 

• shipping products to customers 

• marketing and selling products to consumers 

• collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data including data that may be subject to the general data protection regulation of the european union “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” or general law for protection of personal data “lgpd” of brazil 

• processing transactions 

• summarizing and reporting results of operations 

• hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business plans and financial information 

• complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements 

• providing data security and 

• handling other processes necessary to manage the company’s business 

increased it security threats and cybercrime including advanced persistent threats computer viruses ransomware other types of malicious code hacking phishing and social engineering schemes designed to provide access to the company’s networks or data pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them the company deploys technical and organizational measures to protect and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data however as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventive measures furthermore the company’s relationships with and access provided to third parties and their vendors may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventive measures or fully mitigating harms after an attack or breach occurs 

the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems notwithstanding whether the company takes reasonable steps to prevent such attacks the company’s operations especially its retail operations involve the storage and transmission of employees’ customers’ and consumers’ proprietary information such as credit card and bank account numbers the company’s payment services may be subject to credit card and other payment fraud schemes including unauthorized use of credit cards debit cards or bank account information identity theft or merchant fraud if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches or the inability to effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations a risk of government enforcement action litigation and possible liability and reputational competitive andor business harm which may 

adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 the ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 and the lgpd which went into effect in august 2020 the changes introduced by the gdpr ccpa and lgpd increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices 

the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services as well as the impact of tariffs 

the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in the cost of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products during periods of rising prices of raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers conversely when raw material prices decline customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and to the extent the company has existing inventory lower margins as a result fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the products the company manufactures require particular types of glass metal paper plastic resin wax wood or other materials supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the company’s products pricing and availability of finished goods raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control including general domestic and international economic conditions natural disasters labor costs production levels competition consumer demand import duties and tariffs currency exchange rates international treaties and changes in laws regulations and related interpretations 

specifically evolving trade policies could continue to make sourcing products from foreign countries difficult and costly as the company sources a significant amount of its products from outside of the united states considerable political uncertainty exists in the united states and abroad that could result in continuing changes to the national and international trade policies around which the company has built its sourcing practices and operations additionally the impact of new trade policy under the new us presidential administration is uncertain given the companys reliance upon nondomestic suppliers any significant changes to the united states trade policies and those of other countries in response may cause a material adverse effect on its ability to source products from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results the prior presidential administration imposed a number of tariffs on chineseorigin goods as well as on certain products imported into the united states from the european union any extension of tariffs to additional categories of goods or to additional importers or exporters or additional countries of origin could significantly increase the cost of some our products and reduce our margins the company will continue to work to mitigate the tariff exposure in part through pricing productivity and in some cases relocation however there can be no assurance these mitigation efforts will be successful 

unfavorable shifts in industrywide demand for the company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk 

the company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities impairment of value and obsolescence this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers sales team and management if inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving appropriate writedowns may be recorded in addition the company writes off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand product design changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions which eliminate demand for existing products remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate net realizable market value 

if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company’s estimates inventory writedowns may be required the company cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for its products will not affect it beyond the inventory charges that have already been recorded 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s ability to successfully execute its turnaround plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel in 2020 the company hired four new business unit ceos and a new chief customer officer both its president and chief executive officer and its chief human resources officer joined the company in 2019 competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

damage to the company’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on the company’s business  

maintaining the company’s strong reputation with consumers customers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the company’s continued success adverse publicity about the company its brands corporate practices or any other issue that may be associated with the company whether or not deserved could jeopardize that reputation such adverse publicity could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the company or its brands 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk if third parties fail to comply with our policies and procedures or similar compliance requirements set forth by our customers the company could potentially suffer significant losses of business and revenue from certain customers 

further third parties sell counterfeit versions of some of our products which are often inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity 

finally there has been an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters from time to time the company announces certain initiatives regarding its focus areas which may include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing and social investments in 2020 the company published its corporate sustainability report which included many of these focus areas the company could fail or be perceived to fail in its achievement of such initiatives or it could fail in accurately reporting its progress on such initiatives and goals in addition the company could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters the company’s reputation and business could be negatively impacted by such developments and may be required to invest significant resources to repair such impacts 

damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s brands could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to repair the harm 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact the company’s global business 

at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 31000 employees worldwide a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute the company periodically negotiates with certain unions and labor representatives and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all 

risks related to the strength of global retail commercial and industrial sectors and changes in foreign cultural political and financial market conditions could impair the company’s international operations and financial performance 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe latin america and the asia pacific region these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn can be affected by specific events or general economic conditions including worldwide or countryspecific economic instability 

continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside of the us and potential volatility in domestic andor foreign equity markets may result in considerable pressure on consumer demand which may have an adverse effect on demand for 

the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions such events could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

further some of the company’s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed or where economies have suffered economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls may not be sustainable and as a result the company’s sales or profits related to those countries may decline the economies of other foreign countries important to the company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation in the future the company’s international operations and particularly its business in emerging markets including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of the company’s customers are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the company including among other things 

• protectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing sales or import and export of the company’s products including tariffs and countermeasures 

• new restrictions on access to markets 

• lack of developed infrastructure 

• inflation including hyperinflation or recession 

• devaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies 

• changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws accounting standards trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws 

• social political or economic instability 

• acts of war and terrorism 

• natural disasters or other crises 

• reduced protection of intellectual property rights 

• restrictions on transfer of funds andor exchange of currencies 

• expropriation of assets or forced relocations of operations and 

• other adverse changes in policies including monetary tax andor lending policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by host countries 

in addition our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics which could harm our business and cause our operational results to suffer for example the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our revenues in the first half of 2020 and the eventual duration and financial impact of the pandemic are still uncertain 

further the united kingdom exited the european union on january 31 2020 after protracted political and economic negotiations with a transition period lasting until december 31 2020 during the transition period existing arrangements between the united kingdom and the european union remained in place while the united kingdom and the european union negotiated a trade and cooperation agreement that was entered into on december 24 2020 and went into effect on january 1 2021 while the agreement does not currently impose tariffs on imports across european union borders for goods with a united kingdom or european union origin customs procedures and border checks may cause delays and backlogs in the transport of goods and tariffs still apply for some goods originating outside of the united kingdom or european union further uncertainty still remains regarding the potential for the future imposition of tariffs on imports across european union borders in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate these changes could also cause disruptions to free movement of people and services to and from the united kingdom disruptions to the workforce or the workforce of the company’s suppliers or business partners increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional political and economic uncertainty the foregoing could create uncertainty surrounding the company’s business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers which could increase the cost of some of the company’s products thereby reducing its margins further the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks depending on the extent to which the company may be required to make material changes to its european operations beyond those currently planned the company’s results of operations and business prospects could be negatively affected 

should any of these risks occur the company’s ability to manufacture source sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired in addition the company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations andor the company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets 

financial risks 

the company has substantial indebtedness which could materially and adversely affect the company and its financial position including decreasing its business flexibility impacting its ratings and increasing its borrowing costs 

at december 31 2020 the company had 56 billion in outstanding debt reflecting a reduction of approximately 116 million versus december 31 2019 the company’s substantial indebtedness has had and could continue to have important consequences for the company including 

• requiring the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which reduces the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchases of the company’s common stock and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to adverse business and economic conditions or changes in the company’s business and the industries in which it operates 

• placing the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and 

• limiting along with the financial and nonfinancial covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

in addition if the company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness the company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debttocapitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios lower its credit ratings result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company going forward 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

while the vast majority of the company’s debt is fixed fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business indeed increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and cash flows in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate nine times since december 2015 including four times in 2018 each time by a quarter of a percentage point before reducing interest rates in 2019 three times in response to the covid19 pandemic the us federal reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate to 0 in march 2020 before voting in november 2020 to keep shortterm interest rates anchored in a range between 0 and 025 any change in the fiscal policies or stated target interest rates of the us federal reserve or other central banking institutions or market expectations of such change are difficult to predict and may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness 

an increase in interest rates may also occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the contemplated transition away from the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark reference for shortterm interest rates such a transition may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt the us federal reserve has sponsored the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” which serves as a forum to coordinate and track planning as market participants currently using libor consider a transitioning to alternative reference rates where it is deemed appropriate and b addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that libor might stop on april 3 2018 the us federal reserve began publishing three new reference rates including the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” sofr is observed and backward looking which stands in contrast with libor under the current methodology which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk as is the case with libor sofr is therefore likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions arrc has recommended sofr as the alternative to libor and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment and a paced transition plan to sofr use the financial stability board has taken an interest in libor and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management the international organisation of securities commissions or iosco has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate such as libor ceases publication the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in july and august 2018 isda also published a protocol providing details of the fallback rate conversion methodology in october 2020 it cannot be predicted whether sofr or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces libor and if so the effects on our future results of 

operations or financial condition in a november 30 2020 announcement libor’s administrator signaled to the market that usd libor for the most liquid maturities is now likely to continue to be published until june 30 2023 which would allow time for most legacy contracts to mature before usd libor is no longer available and would also allow for more time for sofr to develop if libor ceases to exist prior to the maturity of our contracts we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established 

reductions in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly the company’s cost of capital the company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations the credit ratings assigned to the company also impact the interest rates paid on short and longterm financing 

on november 1 2019 sp global inc “sp” downgraded the company’s debt rating to “bb” as sp believed the company would fail to meet sp’s target debt level for 2019 in addition on march 9 2020 moody’s corporation “moody’s” downgraded the company’s debt rating to “ba1” based on a view that the company would fail to meet moodys target debt level for 2020 subsequently on april 15 2020 fitch ratings “fitch” downgraded the company’s debt rating to “bb” as they believed the company would fail to meet fitchs target debt level for 2020 as a result of the sp and moodys downgrades the company’s ability to borrow from the commercial paper market on terms it deems acceptable or favorable was eliminated and its cost of borrowing increased 

any further downgrade by moody’s or sp would further increase the company’s borrowing costs and continue to adversely affect the company’s financial results in addition in the event of a future reduction in credit rating the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be further lowered it would further limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market 

the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

see factors affecting liquidity in liquidity and capital resources in item 7  

failure to successfully remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and our failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition 

as further detailed in item 9a controls and procedures  management continues to have a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting a material weakness was disclosed in the company’s 2019 annual report on form 10k filed on march 2 2020 and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q related to the accounting for certain aspects of income taxes at december 31 2019 the company identified that it did not design and maintain controls related to the completeness and accuracy of accounting for state income tax and the accuracy of determining uncertain tax positions including but not limited to verifying the accrued interest associated with uncertain tax positions was properly determined and recorded in addition during the fourth quarter of 2020 management identified that the company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure the accuracy of accounting for nonrecurring tax planning transactions these control deficiencies in the aggregate could result in a misstatement of the companys aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly management has determined that these control deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness 

a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as of december 31 2020 management designed and implemented the following measures to remediate the deficiencies related to the completeness and accuracy of accounting for state income tax and the accuracy of determining uncertain tax positions including but not limited to verifying that the accrued interest associated with uncertain tax positions was properly determined and recorded 

• hired experienced resources with substantive backgrounds in accounting for income taxes as well as us multinational public company experience 

• engaged a third party to review the company’s tax provision processes identify inefficiencies and recommend process enhancements 

• implemented a tax reporting software solution that has enhanced our visibility of uncertain tax positions as well as a software solution that has enhanced our state income tax reporting capabilities 

• implemented enhancements and process improvements to the quarterly and annual provision with respect to uncertain tax positions and state income taxes and 

• undertook extensive training for key personnel in each reporting jurisdiction on tax reporting requirements and our redesigned processes 

in addition as summarized below management is in the process of developing a full remediation plan for and has begun enhancing certain controls to include refinements and improvements to the controls with respect to the deficiencies related to the accuracy of accounting for nonrecurring tax planning transactions 

• enhancing the precision of the control over the calculation and analysis of nonrecurring tax planning transactions 

while management believes that the measures already designed and implemented in both the state tax and uncertain tax positions processes are effective the material weakness in the aggregate will not be considered fully remediated until all aspects of the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively the company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate 

any failure to remediate the material weakness or the identification of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements that may continue undetected negatively impact the public perception of the company and our securities and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations or incur significant additional costs to remediate the material weakness each of which could harm our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in the future or otherwise have a negative impact on our financial condition 

continued declines in the future expected cash flows for the company’s businesses or changes to underlying assumptions used to calculate fair value could result in additional impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results of operations 

the company is required under us gaap to review its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are also required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an otherthantemporary impairment exists 

during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the company recorded noncash impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of 15 billion 12 billion and 83 billion respectively in continuing operations and 112 million and 15 billion in discontinued operations in 2019 and 2018 respectively future events or factors may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events or factors may include but are not limited to divestitures of certain businesses or product lines strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price in the event any such impairment indicators become known or are present the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future given the company’s recent history of impairment charges there is minimal difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of some of its intangible assets increasing the possibility of future impairment charges see critical accounting estimates in item 7 and footnotes 1 and 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the reporting currency for the company’s financial statements is the us dollar and it has substantial assets liabilities revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than us dollars the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires translation of those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency these translations could result in significant changes to the company’s results of operations from period to period although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition foreign currency transaction risk arises when the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions where the settlement occurs in a currency other than its functional currency exchange differences gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they arise although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction risk including the hedging of forecasted cash inflows and outflows it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit divestitures or discontinuations of businesses or products may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing past and future divestitures and business discontinuations also involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel 

• the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture 

• the disruption of the company’s business 

• the potential loss of key employees and 

• disputes or litigation with the buyers 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

legal tax and regulatory risks 

governmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the company’s business operations 

the company is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations in the ordinary course of business the company is also subject to formal and informal regulatory and governmental examinations subpoenas requests for documents testimony or information inquiries investigations threatened legal actions and proceedings the company previously disclosed that it had received a subpoena and related informal document requests from the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” primarily relating to its sales practices and certain accounting matters for the time period beginning from january 1 2016 see footnote 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information responding to governmental investigations voluntary document requests subpoenas or actions by regulatory bodies may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to the company’s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the company’s business operations 

the company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental data privacy competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us may not be taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

on june 18 2019 the us treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” released temporary regulations under irc section 245a “section 245a” as enacted by the 2017 us tax reform legislation “2017 tax reform” and irc section 954c6 the “temporary regulations” to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 tax reform was enacted on august 21 2020 the us treasury and irs released finalized versions of the temporary regulations collectively with the temporary regulations the “regulations” the regulations seek to limit the 100 dividends received deduction permitted by section 245a for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations before the retroactive application of the regulations the company benefited in 2018 from both the 100 dividends received deduction and the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income the company analyzed the regulations and concluded the relevant regulations were not validly issued therefore the company has not accounted for the effects of the regulations in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending december 31 2020 if the company’s position on the regulations is not sustained the company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately 180 million to 220 million related to an income tax benefit from fiscal year 2018 that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time in addition the company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions internationally significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

the company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 

in addition to operational standards environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination accordingly the company may be liable either contractually or by operation of law for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the company is a landfill or other location where it has disposed of wastes or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the company’s ownership or operation of the property given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the company and others at these properties there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted the company does not believe that any of the company’s existing remediation obligations including at thirdparty sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect upon its business results of operations or financial condition however future events such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown contamination may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material see “environmental matters” in footnote 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other environmentalrelated matters 

the company’s business involves the potential for product recalls product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition 

as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products the company is subject to the us consumer products safety act of 1972 as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 which empowers the us consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions under certain circumstances the consumer products safety commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products additionally other laws and agencies such as the national highway traffic safety administration regulate certain consumer products sold by the company in the united states and abroad and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future from time to time the company has announced voluntary recalls of its products where it has identified potential product safety concerns for example in 2019 the company announced a voluntary recall of the contigo gizmo product due to occurrences of the silicone spout detaching from the nylon base which resulted in significant product returns and other costs any repurchase or recall of the company’s products could be costly and damaging to the company’s reputation when the company is required to remove or voluntarily removes its products from the market the company’s reputation could be tarnished and the company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell the company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage bodily injury or other adverse effects 

in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products similar to product liability claims the company faces exposure to class action lawsuits related to the performance safety or advertising of its products such class action suits could result in substantial monetary judgments injunctions related to the sale of products and potentially tarnish the company’s reputation 

although the company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable that insurance is in most cases subject to large selfinsured retentions for which the company is responsible and the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms if at all in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage the company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage additionally the company does not maintain product recall insurance and may not have insurance coverage for claims asserted in class action lawsuits as a result product recalls product liability claims and other productrelated claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards however compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk as a result these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrencebased program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance the company currently either selfinsures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company’s individual per occurrence selfinsured retention the company cannot give assurance however that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to selfinsured retention will not be material 

see footnote 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigationrelated matters 

if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products which could adversely affect the company’s market share and results of operations 

the company’s success with its proprietary products depends in part on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights including its patent trade secret and trademark rights if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products 

the company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products the company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products the company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the company receives or licenses in addition patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company’s products 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impaired 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly including through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such mark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if rights holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business the company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights

recent developments 

coronavirus covid19 

beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2019 through 2020 and into 2021 covid19 emerged and subsequently spread globally ultimately being declared a pandemic by the world health organization the pandemic resulted in various federal state and local governments as well as private entities mandating restrictions on travel and public gatherings closure of nonessential commerce stay at home orders and quarantining of people to limit exposure to the virus the companys global operations similar to those of many large multinational corporations experienced significant covid19 related disruption to its business in three primary areas 

• supply chain while the majority of the company’s factories are considered essential in their applicable jurisdictions and have remained operational the company experienced disruption at certain of its facilities of its 135 manufacturing and distribution facilities approximately 20 were temporarily closed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 the most significant of which were its south deerfield ma home fragrance plant its mexicali mexico and india writing facilities and its juarez mexico connected home and security facility all of which were closed in accordance with state government guidelines by the end of the third quarter of 2020 substantially all of the companys manufacturing and distribution facilities reopened and were operating at or near capacity since then the companys facilities have replenished most of the inventory levels that were depleted by lost production during the temporary closure period the company does however 

continue to face intermittent supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and transportation and logistical challenges and expects this to persist until the current economic and public health conditions improve globally 

• retail while the company’s largest retail customers experienced a surge in sales as their stores remained open a number of secondary customers primarily in the specialty and department store channels temporarily closed their brick and mortar doors in march 2020 and began to reopen in certain regions where conditions improved towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 these dynamics in combination with some retailers’ prioritization of essential items have had a meaningful impact on the companys traditional order patterns in addition the company temporarily closed its yankee candle retail stores in north america as of midmarch all of these stores reopened by the end of the third quarter and have remained open since 

• consumer demand patterns during the quarantine phase of the pandemic consumer purchasing behavior strongly shifted to certain focused categories while certain of the company’s product categories in the food commercial and appliances and cookware business benefited from this shift others particularly the writing business experienced significant slowing changes in consumer purchasing patterns temporary office closures as well as the shift to remote learning for schools and other higher education programs in the fall semester of 2020 adversely impacted the performance of the writing business during 2020 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the company focused on protecting the health and wellbeing of its employees maintaining financial viability and business continuity and keeping manufacturing facilities and distribution centers operating where permitted and deemed prudent to provide products to our consumers the company put in place internal protocols including the establishment of a covid19 task force to monitor the situation as well as communications and guidance issued by foreign federal state and local governments the company instituted mandatory workfromhome policies for employees able to work from home in various locations around the world and implemented a number of precautionary measures at its manufacturing plants warehouses distribution centers and rd centers to reduce persontoperson contact and improve the personal safety for our frontline employees furthermore the company temporarily closed all of the worldwide yankee candle retail stores by the end of the third quarter of 2020 all of the company’s temporarily closed manufacturing and distribution sites reopened and were operating at or near capacity in addition most of the companys office locations have reopened on a limited basis 

the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level to evaluate possible cessation or extensions to all or part of such covid19 precautionary initiatives as part of the companys efforts to contain costs and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility it instituted a hiring freeze for nonessential roles furloughed all fieldbased and most corporate retail employees in north america from april 1 2020 through the third quarter of 2020 tightened discretionary spending reduced nonessential travel and optimized advertising and promotional expenses in addition the company announced a restructuring program during the second quarter of 2020 to reduce overhead costs streamline certain underperforming operations and improve future profitability 

while the negative effects from the covid19 global pandemic in the first half of 2020 were material to the companys operating results the company saw positive momentum which included sales growth during the second half of the year and strong liquidity with over 14 billion in operating cash flow for the year ended december 31 2020 the company believes however the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic to its businesses operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic the impact of new strains and variants of the coronavirus the pandemic’s impact on the us and global economies and the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental plans to administer vaccines to the general public especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and lockdowns or travel bans have been reinstituted those primary drivers are beyond the companys knowledge and control and as a result at this time it is difficult to predict the cumulative impact both in terms of severity and duration covid19 will have on its future sales operating results cash flows and financial condition furthermore the impact to the companys businesses operating results cash flows liquidity and financial condition may be further adversely impacted if the covid19 global pandemic continues to exist or worsens for a prolonged period of time or if plans to administer vaccines are delayed

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairments 

in conjunction with the companys annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter on december 1 the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 20 million associated with a tradename in the learning and development segment as its carrying value exceeded its fair value the impairment reflected a downward revision of forecasted results due to the impact of the delayed and limited reopening of schools and offices as a result of the covid19 global pandemic as well as the continued deterioration in sales for slimerelated adhesive products 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for an indefinitelived intangible asset in the learning and development segment pursuant to the authoritative literature the company performed an impairment test and determined that an indefinitelived intangible asset was impaired during the three months ended september 30 2020 the company recorded a noncash charge of 2 million to reflect impairment of this indefinitelived tradename as its carrying value exceeded its fair value 

during the first quarter of 2020 the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for all of its reporting units as a result of the covid19 global pandemic pursuant to the authoritative literature the company performed an impairment test and determined that certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets in the appliances and cookware home and outdoor living and learning and development segments were impaired during the three months ended march 31 2020 the company recorded an aggregate noncash charge of 13 billion to reflect impairment of these indefinitelived tradenames as their carrying values exceeded their fair values in addition the company determined that its goodwill associated with its appliances and cookware segment was fully impaired during the three months ended march 31 2020 the company recorded a noncash charge of 212 million to reflect the impairment of its goodwill as its carrying value exceeded its fair value

impacts of tariffs 

the united states trade representative “ustr” imposed increased tariffs on some chinese goods imported into the united states resulting in increased costs for the company in 2020 the company was successful at securing from the ustr exemptions and exclusions for some of its products with the most notable exemptions being for certain of its baby gear products which represents a substantial portion of the company’s tariff exposure the company has largely mitigated its tariff exposure in part through pricing productivity and in some cases relocation the phase 1 agreement signed on january 15 2020 with china reduced tariffs under list 4a from 15 to 75 effective february 14 2020 and suspended 301 tariffs under list 4b which went into effect on december 15 2019 the terms of the agreement significantly reduced the estimated impact on tariffs for 2020 in spite of the agreement a full year of previously implemented tariffs had a material impact on the companys operating results and cash flows with gross impact of approximately 91 million in 2020 primarily relating to its appliances and cookware commercial solutions and outdoor and recreation businesses the company will continue to monitor the impact if any of new trade policy under the new us presidential administration and deploy mitigation efforts to offset the gross exposure however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its mitigation efforts 

us treasury regulations 

on june 18 2019 the us treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” released temporary regulations under irc section 245a “section 245a” as enacted by the 2017 us tax reform legislation “2017 tax reform” and irc section 954c6 the “temporary regulations” to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 tax reform was enacted on august 21 2020 the us treasury and irs released finalized versions of the temporary regulations collectively with the temporary regulations the “regulations” the regulations seek to limit the 100 dividends received deduction permitted by section 245a for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations before the retroactive application of the regulations the company benefited in 2018 from both the 100 dividends received deduction and the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income the company analyzed the regulations and concluded the relevant regulations were not validly issued therefore the company has not accounted for the effects of the regulations in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending december 31 2020 the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company if the company’s position on the regulations is not sustained the company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately 180 million to 220 million related to an income tax benefit from fiscal year 2018 that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time in addition the company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties the company intends to vigorously defend its position

in november 2020 the company repurchased 300 million of the 385 senior notes due 2023 with available cash on hand the total consideration excluding accrued interest was approximately 318 million the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of

gross profit for 2020 decreased 4 and gross profit margin declined to 328 as compared with 331 in the prior year period the gross margin decline was driven by higher costs associated with lower sales volume and certain temporary manufacturing closures primarily during the first half of the year as well as business unit mix and inflation related to input costs the decline in gross margin also reflected increased costs across most of its business units related to the covid19 pandemic including increased employee costs such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives and other costs such as procurement of personal protective equipment the gross profit decline was partially offset by the cumulative depreciation expense recorded during the prior year as a result of the company’s decision to retain the commercial business as well as gross productivity and lower product recall costs changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted gross profit by 25 million or 1 

all of the companys manufacturing and distribution facilities are operating at or near capacity and its facilities have replenished most of the inventory levels that were depleted by lost production during the temporary closure period however the company does continue to face intermittent supply and labor shortages capacity constraints and transportation and logistical challenges which have negatively impacted net sales growth and expects this to persist until the conditions improve globally while the negative effects from the covid19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 were material to the companys operating results the company saw positive momentum during the second half of the year at this time the company is unable to predict any further impact both in terms of severity and duration that the covid19 global pandemic will have on its businesses customers and suppliers while the company has deployed cost containment initiatives to mitigate the impact of the pandemic such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate the entire impact the company will continue to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations to evaluate possible further cessation or extensions of its operations

liquidity and capital resources 

at the onset of the covid19 global pandemic in light of uncertainty in the global economy as well as equity and bond markets the company undertook several actions to further strengthen its financial position and balance sheet and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility including issuing debt evaluating supply purchases enhancing customer credit review processes reviewing operating expenses prioritizing capital expenditures as well as extending payment terms for goods and services while the company has the ability to continue to take more of these actions if needed it also has the ability to borrow under its existing accounts receivable securitization facility the “securitization facility” and 125 billion revolving credit facility that matures in december 2023 the “credit revolver” at december 31 2020 the company had no outstanding drawings against the securitization facility and credit revolver the company currently believes its capital structure and cash resources can continue to support the funding of future dividends and will continue to evaluate all actions to strengthen its financial position and balance sheet and to maintain its financial liquidity flexibility and capital allocation strategy 

at december 31 2020 the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 981 million of which approximately 505 million was held by the company’s nonus subsidiaries overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operating activities and borrowing capacity along with the actions noted above provide the company with continued financial viability and adequate liquidity to fund its operations support its growth platforms pay down debt and debt maturities as they come due and complete its ongoing turnaround initiatives the company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant as the covid19 global pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving the companys plans as described above may change although the company saw positive momentum and strong cash generated from operating activities over the second half of 2020 the company is still unable to predict the duration and severity of this pandemic which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s future sales results of operations financial position and cash flows particularly if the global pandemic continues to exist or worsens for a prolonged period of time or if plans to administer vaccines are delayed any such material adverse impacts could result in the companys inability to satisfy financial maintenance covenants and could limit the ability to make future borrowings under existing debt instruments 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash changed as follows for 2020 2019 and 2018 in millions 



the company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers 

factors affecting liquidity 

as a result of the debt ratings downgrades by moody’s corporation moody’s and sp global inc sp described in footnote 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company’s ability to borrow from the commercial paper market on terms it deems acceptable or favorable was eliminated previously the company was able to issue commercial paper up to a maximum of 800 million provided there was a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the credit revolver the company’s ability to borrow under the credit revolver was not affected by the downgrades as such the company does not expect any change in its ability to access liquidity in the short term as a result of the downgrades the interest rate for borrowings under the 

credit revolver is the borrowing period referenced libor rate plus 1275 basis points on april 15 2020 fitch ratings fitch downgraded the company’s debt rating to bb as they believed the company would fail to meet fitchs target debt level for 2020 

the credit revolver requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants a failure by the company to maintain its financial covenants would impair its ability to borrow under the credit revolver at the time of filing this annual report on form 10k the company is in compliance with all of its financial covenants 

in addition certain of the company’s senior notes aggregating to approximately 43 billion in principal amount outstanding are subject to an interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points as a result of the downgrades from sp and moodys for a total of 50 basis points this increase to the interest rates of each series of the companys senior notes subject to adjustment increased the company’s interest expense for 2020 by approximately 17 million and approximately 21 million thereafter on an annualized basis the fitch downgrade did not impact the interest rates on any of the companys senior notes 

furthermore the company may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease as a result of the downgrades 

cash flows from operating activities 

the change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to successful working capital initiatives which included the extension of payment terms for goods and services with vendors enhanced customer credit review and collections processes and evaluating supply purchases and focused inventory management in addition net cash from operating activities benefited from higher accounts receivable sold under the customer receivables purchase agreement and a timing benefit from higher payables due to inventory build to support demand which is expected to partially reverse in 2021 the change in net cash was partially offset by higher annual incentive compensation payments in the current year 

the change in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2019 is primarily due to favorable working capital management as a result of the company’s continued focus on improving its working capital accounts receivable decreased in 2019 due to better terms compliance as a result of improvements in the company’s dispute resolution process and accounts receivable sold under the customer receivables purchase agreement operating cash flow also benefited from a decrease in cash paid for interest and income taxes of approximately 154 million and 136 million respectively

the company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through december 2021 the derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss “aocl” and is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 509 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales 

the company also uses foreign currency contracts primarily forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 994 million notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through december 2021 fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other income expense net 

commodity contracts 

to a lesser extent the company also enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the risk that the rising price of these commodities could have on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials these commoditybased derivatives provide the company with cost certainty at december 31 2020 the company had no notional amount outstanding of commoditybased derivatives that are designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in cost of products sold 

the following table presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments at december 31 2020 in millions 



contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received at december 31 2020 and other noncancelable obligations including capital assets and other licensing services 

the following table summarizes the effect that material contractual obligations and commitments are expected to have on the company’s cash flow in the indicated period at december 31 2020 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements 



1 amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due excluding interest based on borrowings outstanding at december 31 2020 for further information relating to these obligations see footnote 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

2 amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding at december 31 2020 excluding the impact of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps interest on floatingrate debt was estimated using the rate in effect at december 31 2020 for further information see footnote 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

3 amounts represent lease liabilities on operating and financing leases at december 31 2020 see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

4 primarily consists of purchase commitments with suppliers entered into at december 31 2020 for the purchase of materials packaging and other components and services these purchase commitment amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally enforceable and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases 

5 represents the future cash payments related to 2017 tax reform for the onetime provisional transition tax on the company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings 

6 total does not include contractual obligations reported on the december 31 2020 balance sheet as current liabilities except for current portion of longterm debt shortterm debt and accrued interest 

the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 452 million in unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 51 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

at december 31 2020 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and are recognized at a point in time which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms which is also when control is transferred the company’s primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of its consumer and commercial products to its customers 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services certain customers may receive cash andor noncash incentives such as cash discounts returns credits or reimbursements related to defective products customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other customerrelated programs which are accounted for as variable consideration in some cases the company must apply judgment including contractual rates and historical payment trends when estimating variable consideration 

in addition the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue the company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost the company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for i contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and ii contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the company has the right to invoice for services performed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter on december 1 or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant on december 1 2020 the carrying values for total goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were 35 billion and 23 billion respectively 

goodwill 

goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units reporting units are determined based upon the company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level the company’s operations are comprised of eight reporting units within its five primary operating segments 

during the first quarter of 2020 the company concluded that an impairment triggering event had occurred for all of its reporting units as the company has experienced significant covid19 related disruption to its business in three primary areas supply chain as certain manufacturing and distribution facilities were temporarily closed in line with government guidelines the temporary closure of secondary customer retail stores as well as the companys yankee candle retail stores in north america and changes in consumer demand patterns to certain focused categories the company used a quantitative approach which involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss would be calculated as the differences between these amounts limited to the amount of reporting unit goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

the quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and the estimation of future cash flows business growth rates terminal values discount rates and total enterprise value the income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on fiveyear cash flow projections the cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debtfree” basis before cash payments to equity and interestbearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit a provision is made based on these projections for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period or terminal value the present value of the finiteperiod cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate the company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting its latest projections which included among other things the impact of tariffs on chinese imports the current expectations as to the impact of covid19 on its operations as well as other inflation at the time the company performed its impairment testing 

as a result of the impairment testing performed in connection with the covid19 global pandemic triggering event the company determined that its goodwill associated with its appliances and cookware segment was impaired during first quarter of 2020 the company recorded a noncash charge of 212 million to reflect the impairment of its goodwill as its carrying value exceeded its fair value there was no goodwill impairment recorded in conjunction with the company’s annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter and as of december 31 2020 there were no reporting units with fair values within 10 of the associated carrying values additionally a hypothetical 10 reduction in forecasted earnings before interest taxes and amortization used in the discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 

see footnotes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

indefinitelived intangibles 

the testing of indefinitelived intangibles primarily trademarks and tradenames under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as cash flow projections royalty rates terminal values and discount rates an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired by the amount its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value for impairment testing purposes the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is determined using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method the relief from royalty method estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset the excess earnings method estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual or excess cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present the excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital tangible assets and other intangible assets changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations 

as a result of the impairment testing performed in connection with the covid19 pandemic triggering event during the first quarter of 2020 the company determined that certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets in the appliances and cookware commercial solutions home solutions learning and development and outdoor and recreation segments were impaired during the first quarter of 2020 the company recorded impairment charges of 13 billion to reflect impairment of these indefinitelived tradenames because their carrying values exceeded their fair values 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for an indefinitelived intangible asset in the learning and development segment as a result of a product line divestiture pursuant to the authoritative literature the company performed an impairment test and determined that the indefinitelived intangible asset was impaired as its carrying value 

exceeded its fair value during the third quarter of 2020 the company recorded a noncash charge of 2 million to reflect the impairment of this indefinitelived intangible asset see footnotes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 in conjunction with its annual impairment testing the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 20 million associated with a tradename in the learning and development segment as its carrying value exceeded its fair value the impairment reflected a downward revision of forecasted results due to the impact of the delayed and limited reopening of schools and offices as a result of the covid19 global pandemic as well as the continued deterioration in sales for slimerelated adhesive products an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of this tradename would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge of approximately 14 million the remaining carrying value of this tradename is approximately 135 million 

the remaining tradenames within the companys learning and development segment with no impairment during the fourth quarter of 2020 impairment test had carrying values of 387 million with 310 million of those with fair values in excess of 10 of carrying values respectively an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the remaining learning and development tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 5 million 

there were no impairments of the company’s tradenames within the appliances and cookware and outdoor and recreation segments during the fourth quarter of 2020 impairment test the remaining carrying value of tradenames within these segments were approximately 58 million and 119 million respectively with 54 million and 113 million of those tradenames with fair values in excess of 10 of the carrying values respectively an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the appliances and cookware tradenames would not have resulted in an impairment charge an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the outdoor and recreation tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 1 million 

there were no impairments of the company’s tradenames within the commercial solutions and home solutions segments during the fourth quarter of 2020 impairment test the remaining carrying value of tradenames within these segments were approximately 576 million and 10 billion respectively and all tradenames have fair values in excess of 10 of the carrying values an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the commercial solutions tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 6 million an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the home solutions tradenames would not have resulted in an impairment charge 

the company believes the circumstances and global disruption caused by covid19 may continue to affect its businesses future operating results cash flows and financial condition and that the scope and duration of the pandemic is highly uncertain in addition some of the other inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates industry growth credit ratings foreign exchange rates labor inflation and tariffs given the uncertainty of these factors as well as the inherent difficulty in predicting the severity and duration of the covid19 global pandemic and associated recovery and the uncertainties regarding the potential financial impact on the companys business and the overall economy there can be no assurance that the companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 

the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets which were based on facts and circumstances known at this time it is however possible that new events may occur or actual events may result in forecasted cash flows revenue and earnings that differ from those that formed the basis of the company’s estimates and assumptions actual results could be materially different from the company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value for each of the company’s reporting units if the global pandemic caused by covid19 continues to persist for an extended period of time if such a scenario were to occur the company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets the company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment the company may be required to perform additional impairment testing based on further deterioration of the global economic environment continued disruptions to the company’s business further declines in operating results of the company’s reporting units andor tradenames further sustained deterioration of the company’s market capitalization and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity experiences a sustained deterioration from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

at december 31 2020 there were four indefinitelived tradenames with fair values less than 10 of their associated carrying values within the appliances and cookware learning and development and outdoor and recreation segments a hypothetical 10 reduction in the forecasted debtfree cash flows used in the excess earnings method to determine the fair value of certain indefinitelived intangibles of the company would not have resulted an impairment a hypothetical 10 reduction in forecasted revenue used in the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of certain indefinitelived intangibles would have resulted in incremental impairment charges in the companys learning and development and outdoor and recreation segments of 35 million and 1 million respectively see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment operating leases and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group early termination of an operating lease a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group the company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available with the exception of the yankee candle business where testing is performed at the retail store level see footnotes 6 7 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

income taxes 

the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are 

unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors the pension and postretirement obligations are measured at december 31 2020 and 2019 

the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of pension plan assets the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us largecapitalization stocks us smallcapitalization stocks and international securities investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

the expected longterm rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations historical asset returns current and expected future market conditions risk and active management premiums the target asset allocations for the company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan in part due to plan demographics funded status and liability duration in general the company’s target asset allocations are as follows global equities approximately 20 to 40 fixed income approximately 50 to 70 and cash alternative investments and other approximately zero to 20 at december 31 2020 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions the company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans the asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile at december 31 2020 the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows equities approximately 24 and other investments alternative investments fixedincome securities cash and other approximately 76 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions 

for 2020 2019 and 2018 the actual return loss on plan assets for the company’s us pension plan assets was approximately 178 million 213 million and 71 million respectively versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately 59 million 59 million and 67 million respectively the actual amount of future contributions will depend in part on longterm actual return on assets and future discount rates pension contributions for all the company’s pension plans for 2021 are estimated to be approximately 22 million as compared to the 2020 contributions of approximately 25 million 

the weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2020 was approximately 41 for the company’s pension plans the weighted average discount rate at the 2020 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 19 and 18 respectively a 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2020 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately 64 million 

the healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers at the 2020 measurement date the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 67 the current healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decrease to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 45 see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in general business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices and that can affect the cost of operating investing and financing under those conditions the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks the company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt as such the company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs at december 31 2020 approximately 100 million of the company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps the remainder of the debt approximately 55 billion carries a fixed rate of interest based upon the company’s debt structure at december 31 2020 a hypothetical 1 increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately 1 million and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 332 million 

while the company transacts business predominantly in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars a substantial portion of the company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies such as the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar european euro japanese yen and mexican peso changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses for 2020 approximately 33 of the company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies the most significant of which were european euro approximately 10 canadian dollar approximately 4 and british pounds approximately 4 the primary purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives 

the company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials as such the company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the company enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials a hypothetical 10 change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the company’s results of operations in this sensitivity analysis all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments all of which are highly rated institutions however the company does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties 

the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as required by rule 13a15b of the exchange act and concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2020 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k due to the material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting described below 

the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have also concluded that notwithstanding the existence of the material weakness the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k present fairly in all material respects the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with us gaap remediation efforts to address the material weakness are described below under the section “remediation plan” 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined by rule 13a15f of the exchange act the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us gaap the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets 

• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us gaap and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate as required by rule 13a15 under the exchange act management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth in the “internal control  integrated framework” 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the company continues to have a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in management’s assessment of the internal control over financial reporting in item 9a controls and procedures of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 the “2019 form 10k” the company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for certain aspects of income taxes at december 31 2019 the company identified that it did not design and maintain effective controls related to the completeness and accuracy of accounting for state income tax and the accuracy of determining uncertain tax positions including but not limited to verifying the accrued interest associated with uncertain tax positions was properly determined and recorded in addition during the fourth quarter of 2020 management identified that the company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure the accuracy of accounting for nonrecurring tax planning transactions 

these deficiencies resulted in errors recorded as of and for the quarter ended december 31 2020 impacting the current tax benefit for the quarter ended december 31 2020 and deferred tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities as of december 31 2020 and errors previously recorded as of and for the quarter ended december 31 2019 impacting the current tax benefit for the quarter ended december 31 2019 and goodwill other assets deferred tax liabilities other noncurrent liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31 2019 these control deficiencies in the aggregate could result in a misstatement of the company’s aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly management has determined that these control deficiencies in aggregate constitute a material weakness 

because of the material weakness management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2020 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp as stated in their report as set forth under item 8 of this 2020 annual report 

remediation plan 

as of december 31 2020 management designed and implemented the following measures to remediate the deficiencies related to the completeness and accuracy of accounting for state income tax and the accuracy of determining uncertain tax positions including but not limited to verifying that the accrued interest associated with uncertain tax positions was properly determined and recorded 

• hired experienced resources with substantive backgrounds in accounting for income taxes as well as us multinational public company experience 

• engaged a third party to review the company’s tax provision processes identify inefficiencies and recommend process enhancements 

• implemented a tax reporting software solution that has enhanced our visibility of uncertain tax positions as well as a software solution that has enhanced our state income tax reporting capabilities 

• implemented enhancements and process improvements to the quarterly and annual provision with respect to the accuracy of uncertain tax positions and completeness and accuracy of state income taxes and 

• undertook extensive training for key personnel in each reporting jurisdiction on tax reporting requirements and our redesigned processes 

in addition as summarized below management is in the process of developing a full remediation plan for and has begun enhancing certain controls to include refinements and improvements to the controls with respect to the deficiencies related to the accuracy of accounting for nonrecurring tax planning transactions 

• enhancing the precision of the control over the calculation and analysis of nonrecurring tax planning transactions 

while management believes that the measures already designed and implemented in both the state tax and uncertain tax positions processes are effective the material weakness in the aggregate will not be considered fully remediated until all aspects of the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively the company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2020 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through pricing 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers reducing current inventory levels demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with the company’s products the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished our yankee candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers including department stores gift stores and national specialty retailers that sells candles

 item 1a risk factors 

the ownership of the company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to invest in the company’s securities the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks that are currently unknown to the company or that the company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe latin america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn can be affected by specific events or general economic conditions including worldwide or countryspecific economic instability 

for example uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union commonly known as brexit has caused political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm consumer demand and ultimately adversely impact the company’s business continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside of the us and potential volatility in domestic andor foreign equity markets may result in considerable pressure on consumer demand which may have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions such events 

could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished a proliferation of digitally native brands has further intensified the competitive landscape the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large retailers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers reducing inventory levels demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future for example the company’s results in 2018 were impacted negatively by the bankruptcy and liquidation of toys ‘r’ us in particular a loss of or a failure by another one of the company’s large customers could adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s sales are dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the company’s future financial performance 

the company’s customer base is relatively fragmented although the company has longestablished relationships with many customers the company generally does not have any longterm supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers purchases by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders as a result these customers may cancel their orders change purchase quantities from forecast volumes delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship significant or numerous cancellations reductions delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition because many of the company’s costs are fixed a reduction in customer demand due to decreased sales to end customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s gross profit margins and operating income the retail landscape in many of the company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may adversely affect the company’s relationships with its key retailers whereby the number of products it sells will no longer be a reliable indicator of the amount of future business the company can expect 

the company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large highvolume retail customers however the company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to 

  



 

the company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers or that customer demand will remain consistent a substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers and an inability to adapt to the emergence of alternative retail channels could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could materially adversely affect the company’s sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades the company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets reduce inventory and rationalize their supply chain which could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in future pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand the company’s ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retail and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

although the atp is now completed the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit divestitures or discontinuations of businesses or products may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing past and future divestitures and business discontinuations also involve additional risks including the following 

 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

failure to grow the company’s ecommerce business and the cost of its increasing ecommerce investments may materially adversely affect the company’s market position net sales and financial performance 

the retail industry is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate at the same time the portion of retail business at traditional “brick and mortar” stores and shopping centers is decreasing 

the company’s strategy includes investments in ecommerce and investments in technology initiatives if these investments fail to adequately or effectively allow the company to grow its ecommerce business maintain or grow its overall market position or otherwise benefit the company the company’s market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of ecommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of sales by the company’s other customers which could if not offset by a greater increase in ecommerce sales materially adversely affect the business of the company 

furthermore the cost of certain ecommerce and technology investments may adversely impact the company’s financial performance in the shortterm and may adversely impact its financial performance over the longer term there can be no assurance that investments in ecommerce infrastructure and technology will result in increased sales through ecommerce or otherwise 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and our failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition 

as further detailed in item 9a below management has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting one material weakness was disclosed in the company’s 2018 annual report on form 10k filed on march 4 2019 and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q related to accounting for the impact of divestitures the company also discovered a material weakness in december 2019 related to accounting for certain tax matters these control deficiencies could have resulted in a misstatement of accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly the company’s management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses 

under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board the “pcaob” a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

to remediate the material weakness in accounting for divestitures the company has completed the documentation and testing of the following corrective actions 

 

though management has effectively and successfully operated the nontax components of the aforementioned remediation plan for three consecutive quarters in 2019 this material weakness will not be considered remediated until each component of 

management’s remedial actions operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing of divestiture transactions or otherwise that these controls are operating effectively 

during the course of 2019 management made certain changes as part of the remediation of the material weakness related to accounting for divestitures which relate to the material weakness for accounting for income taxes and which the company believes will contribute to the remediation efforts of the material weakness these changes include 

 

subsequent to the identification of the material weakness for accounting for income taxes management began to implement a tax reporting software solution that has enhanced our visibility of uncertain tax positions in order to remediate the material weakness 

the company plans to implement the following additional steps to remediate the material weakness for accounting for income taxes 

 

while management believes that it now has the requisite personnel to operate the controls in the tax function and the remediation actions described above should remediate the material weakness with respect to accounting for income taxes as management continues the remediation process it may determine certain additional enhancements may be necessary this material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively the company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate 

any failure to remediate the material weaknesses or the identification of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements that may continue undetected negatively impact the public perception of the company and our securities and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations or incur significant additional costs to remediate the material weakness each of which could harm our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in the future or otherwise have a negative impact on our financial condition 

the company has substantial indebtedness which could materially and adversely affect the company and its financial position including decreasing its business flexibility impacting its ratings and increasing its borrowing costs 

at december 31 2019 the company had 57 billion in outstanding debt reflecting a reduction of approximately 13 billion versus the end of 2018 the company’s substantial indebtedness has had and could continue to have important consequences for the company including 

 

in addition if the company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness the company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debttocapitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios lower its credit ratings result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company going forward 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

while the vast majority of the company’s debt is fixed fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business indeed increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and cash flows in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate nine times since december 2015 including four times in 2018 each time by a quarter of a percentage point before reducing interest rates in 2019 three times any change in the fiscal policies or stated target interest rates of the us federal reserve or other central banking institutions or market expectations of such change are difficult to predict and may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness 

an increase in interest rates may also occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the contemplated transition away from the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark reference for shortterm interest rates such a transition may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt the us federal reserve has sponsored the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” which serves as a forum to coordinate and track planning as market participants currently using libor consider a transitioning to alternative reference rates where it is deemed appropriate and b addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that libor might stop on april 3 2018 the us federal reserve began publishing three new reference rates including the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” arrc has recommended sofr as the alternative to libor and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment and a paced transition plan to sofr use the financial stability board has taken an interest in libor and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management the international organisation of securities commissions or iosco has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate such as libor ceases publication the international swaps and derivatives association has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in july and august 2018 it cannot be predicted whether sofr or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces libor and if so the effects on our customers or our future results of operations or financial condition 

governmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the company’s business operations 

the company is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations in the ordinary course of business the company is also subject to formal and informal regulatory and governmental examinations subpoenas requests for documents testimony or information inquiries investigations threatened legal actions and proceedings in particular on january 31 2020 the company received a subpoena from the sec primarily relating to its sales practices and certain accounting matters see footnote 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information responding to governmental investigations voluntary document requests subpoenas or actions by regulatory bodies may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to the company’s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the company’s business operations the impact of these inquiries and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental data privacy competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us may not be taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

on june 18 2019 the us treasury and the internal revenue service released temporary regulations under irc section 245a “section 245a” as enacted by the 2017 us tax reform legislation “2017 tax reform” and irc section 954c6 the “temporary regulations” to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 tax reform was enacted the temporary regulations seek to limit the 100 dividends received deduction permitted by section 245a for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations before the retroactive application of the temporary regulations the company benefited in 2018 from both the 100 dividends received deduction and the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income the company has analyzed the temporary regulations and concluded that the relevant temporary regulations were not validly issued therefore the company has not accounted for the effects of the temporary regulations in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending december 31 2019 the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant temporary regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company if the company’s position on the temporary regulations is not sustained the company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately 180 million to 220 million related to an income tax benefit from the 2018 year that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time in addition the company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties the company intends to vigorously defend its position 

the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services as well as the impact of tariffs 

the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in the cost of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products during periods of rising prices of raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers conversely when raw material prices decline customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and to the extent the company has existing inventory lower margins as a result fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the products the company manufactures require particular types of glass metal paper plastic resin wax wood or other materials supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the company’s products pricing and availability of finished goods raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control including general domestic and international economic conditions natural disasters labor costs production levels competition consumer demand import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 

specifically evolving trade policies could continue to make sourcing products from foreign countries difficult and costly as the company sources a significant amount of its products from outside of the united states considerable political uncertainty exists in the united states and abroad that could result in continuing changes to the national and international trade policies around which the company has built its sourcing practices and operations given the companys reliance upon nondomestic suppliers any significant changes to the united states trade policies and those of other countries in response may cause a material adverse effect on its ability to source products from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results for example in march 2018 the current presidential administrationimposed tariffs of 25 on steel imports and 10 on aluminum imports these tariffs which remain in effect apply to imported steel and aluminum products from most of the world in addition the current presidential administration imposed additional tariffs of 25 on many chineseorigin goods effective july 6 2018 and august 23 2018 and imposed additional tariffs of 10 on a substantial number of additional chineseorigin goods “list 3 products” effective september 24 2018 the 10 tariff on list 3 products increased to 25 on may 10 2019 the current presidential administration also imposed 15 tariffs on additional chineseorigin goods list 4a on september 1 2019 the phase 1 agreement signed on january 15 2020 reduced list 4a from 15 to 75 effective february 14 2020 and suspended tariffs under list 4b at 15 which was due to go into effect on december 15 2019 in addition to tariffs on chineseorigin goods on october 18 2019 the current presidential administration imposed additional tariffs on certain products imported into the united states from the european union any extension of tariffs to additional categories of goods or to additional importers or exporters or additional countries of origin could significantly increase the cost of some our products and reduce our margins the company will continue to work to mitigate the tariff exposure in part through pricing productivity and in some cases relocation however there can be no assurance these mitigation efforts will be successful 

the company’s operations are dependent upon thirdparty vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the company’s business operations 

the company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties the company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products in many cases the company does not enter into longterm contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers instead buying parts and products on a “purchase order” basis as a result the company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 

the ability of thirdparty suppliers to timely deliver finished goods andor raw materials and the ability of the company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns or significant weather and health conditions affecting manufacturers andor shippers any adverse change in the company’s relationships with its thirdparty suppliers the financial condition of thirdparty suppliers the ability of thirdparty suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis or the company’s ability to import products from thirdparty suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial condition of the company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations for example certain businesses in the baby business unit have a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply go out of business or discontinue a particular component the company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner if at all any inability of the company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the company the company cannot assure you that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose and the company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its thirdparty suppliers the company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products 

changes in foreign cultural political and financial market conditions could impair the company’s international operations and financial performance 

some of the company’s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed such as brazil or where economies have suffered economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls may not be sustainable and as a result the company’s sales or profits related to those countries may decline the economies of other foreign countries important to the company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation in the future the company’s international operations and particularly its business in emerging markets including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of the company’s customers are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the company including among other things 



 

in addition our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics which could harm our business and cause our operational results to suffer for example in december 2019 and january 2020 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in wuhan china has resulted in travel disruption and an impact on corporate operations in china at this point the exact extent to which the coronavirus may impact our supply chain or results of operations is uncertain however our revenues may be impacted in the first half of 2020 

further on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union because of the referendum the british government began negotiating the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union while the european union and united kingdom reached an agreement on brexit in october 2019 and the united kingdom exited the european union on january 31 2020 details of the new trade and regulatory relationship are still to be finalized there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and european union countries and increased regulatory complexities in the future these changes could cause disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom disruptions to the workforce or the workforce of the company’s suppliers or business partners increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal political and economic uncertainty the foregoing could create uncertainty surrounding the company’s business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers which could increase the cost of some of the company’s products thereby reducing its margins further the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks depending on the extent to which the company may be required to make material changes to its european operations beyond those currently planned the company’s results of operations and business prospects could be negatively affected 

should any of these risks occur the company’s ability to manufacture source sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired the company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations andor the company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the reporting currency for the company’s financial statements is the us dollar and it has substantial assets liabilities revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than us dollars the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires translation of those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency these translations could result in significant changes to the company’s results of operations from period to period although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition foreign currency transaction risk arises when the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions where the settlement occurs in a currency other than its functional currency exchange differences gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they arise although the company may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction risk including the hedging of forecasted cash inflows and outflows it cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

a cyberattack or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology “it” systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 

increased it security threats and cybercrime including advanced persistent threats computer viruses ransomware other types of malicious code hacking phishing and social engineering schemes designed to provide access to the company’s networks or data pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures furthermore the company’s relationships with and access provided to third parties and their vendors may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after an attack or breach occurs 

the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems the company’s operations especially its retail operations involve the storage and transmission of employees’ customers’ and consumers’ proprietary information such as credit card and bank account numbers the company’s payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes including unauthorized use of credit cards debit cards or bank account information identity theft or merchant fraud if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations a risk of government enforcement action litigation and possible liability and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which goes into effect on january 1 2020 the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices 

continued declines in the future expected cash flows for the company’s businesses or changes to underlying assumptions used to calculate fair value could result in additional impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results of operations 

the company is required under us gaap to review its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are also required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an otherthantemporary impairment exists 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company recorded noncash impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of 12 billion and 83 billion  respectively in continuing operations and 1121 million and 15 billion  respectively in discontinued operations future events or factors may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events or factors may include but are not limited to divestitures of certain businesses strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price in the event any such impairment indicators become known or are present the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future given the company’s impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 there is minimal difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of some of the company’s reporting units and intangible assets increasing the possibility of future impairment charges 

unfavorable shifts in industrywide demand for the company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk 

the company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities impairment of value and obsolescence this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers sales team and management if inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving appropriate writedowns may be recorded in addition the company writes off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand product design changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions which eliminate demand for existing products remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate net realizable market value 

if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company’s estimates inventory writedowns may be required the company cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for its products will not affect it beyond the inventory charges that have already been recorded 

the company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 

in addition to operational standards environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination accordingly the company may be liable either contractually or by operation of law for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the company is a landfill or other location where it has disposed of wastes or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the company’s ownership or operation of the property given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the company and others at these properties there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted the company does not believe that any of the company’s existing remediation obligations including at thirdparty sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect upon its business results of operations or financial condition however future events such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown contamination may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material see “environmental matters” in footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other environmentalrelated matters 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s ability to successfully implement its turnaround plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel in 2019 the company hired a new president  chief executive officer and a new chief human resources officer and the current chief financial officer and chief accounting officer joined the company in december 2018 and march 2019 respectively competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions internationally significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

the company’s business involves the potential for product recalls product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition 

as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products the company is subject to the us consumer products safety act of 1972 as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 which empowers the us consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions under certain circumstances the consumer products safety commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products additionally other laws and agencies such as the national highway traffic safety administration regulate certain consumer products sold by the company in the united states and abroad and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future from time to time the company has announced voluntary recalls of its products where it has identified potential product safety concerns for example in 2019 the company announced a voluntary recall of the contigo gizmo product due to a concern over the silicone spout detaching from the nylon base which resulted in significant product returns and other costs any repurchase or recall of the company’s products could be costly and damaging to the company’s reputation if the company were required to remove or it voluntarily removed its products from the market the company’s reputation could be tarnished and the company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell the company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage bodily injury or other adverse effects 

in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products similar to product liability claims the company faces exposure to class action lawsuits related to the performance safety or advertising of its products such class action suits could result in substantial monetary judgments injunctions related to the sale of products and potentially tarnish the company’s reputation 

although the company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable that insurance is in most cases subject to large selfinsured retentions for which the company is responsible and the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms if at all in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage the company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage additionally the company does not maintain product recall insurance and may not have insurance coverage for claims asserted in class action lawsuits as a result product recalls product liability claims and other productrelated claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards however compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk as a result these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrencebased program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance the company currently either selfinsures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company’s individual per occurrence selfinsured retention the company cannot give assurance however that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to selfinsured retention will not be material 

see footnote 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigationrelated matters 

if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products which could adversely affect the company’s market share and results of operations 

the company’s success with its proprietary products depends in part on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights including its patent and trademark rights if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products 

the company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products the company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products the company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the company receives or licenses in addition patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company’s products 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impaired 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if rights holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business the company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

reductions in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly the company’s cost of capital the company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations the credit ratings assigned to the company also impact the interest rates paid on short and longterm financing 

on february 20 2019 fitch downgraded the company’s longterm issuer default rating from “bbb” to bb and the shortterm issuer default rating to “b” from “f3” further on november 1 2019 standard and poor’s rating services “standard  poor’s” reduced the company’s longterm issuer credit rating to “bb” from “bbb” resulting in a reduction of the company’s senior debt below investment grade this resulted in an increase in the cost of shortterm and longterm borrowing for the company including a twentyfivebasis point increase in the interest rate payable on approximately 45 billion of the company’s senior notes issued in march 2016 for which the interest rates payable are subject to adjustment from time to time if either moody’s or standard  poor’s downgrades or subsequently upgrades the rating assigned to such notes while the interest on these notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in ratings by either credit rating agency if such notes become rated “baa1” or higher by moody’s and “bbb” or higher by standard  poor’s financial services llc in each case with stable or positive outlook the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will be upgraded in the near future or that in the alternative such ratings will not be further lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant 

any downgrade by moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” which would further reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade and would further increase the company’s borrowing costs would continue to adversely affect the company’s financial results in addition in the event of a future reduction in credit rating the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be further lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market if the company’s access to commercial paper markets were to become limited or eliminated entirely and it were required to obtain shortterm funding under its revolving credit facility or its other credit facilities the company would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

see factors affecting liquidity in liquidity and capital resources in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets expected health care costs or mortality rates the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

damage to the company’s reputation could have an adverse effect on the company’s business  

maintaining the company’s strong reputation with consumers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the company’s continued success adverse publicity about the company its brands corporate practices or any other issue that may be associated with the company whether or not deserved could jeopardize that reputation such adverse publicity could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the company or its brands 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

further third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

finally there has been an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters from time to time the company announces certain initiatives regarding its focus areas which may include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing and social investments the company could fail or be perceived to fail in its achievement of such initiatives or it could fail in accurately reporting its progress on such initiatives and goals in addition the company could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters the company’s reputation and business could be negatively impacted by such developments 

damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s brands could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to repair the harm 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact the company’s global business 

at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 30000 employees worldwide a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute the company periodically negotiates with certain unions and labor representatives and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all all of which may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 

the company’s plans to integrate its acquired businesses improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would materially adversely affect its financial results 

the company has pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties the company’s success depends on its ability to integrate such acquired brands businesses or technologies to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies to reduce supply chain costs and to streamline and redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion future acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or significant integration and transaction costs any of these risks should they materialize could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition further the company is in the midst of implementing various plans to reduce costs and improve cash flows these efforts are designed to reduce the complexity of the organization improve the company’s cash conversion cycle and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms these initiatives are further designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics among other things these global initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated other major productivity streamlining and divestment programs may also be required in the future such initiatives may require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during 2018 the company was the target of a proxy contest by a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if a similar proposal were to be made again the company would likely incur significant costs which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business

recent developments 

annual goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairments 

during the third quarter management historically performs its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing during the second quarter of 2019 the company changed the date of its annual impairment test from july 1 to december 1 the change was made to more closely align the impairment test date with the company’s annual planning and budgeting process as well as its longterm planning and forecasting process pursuant to the authoritative accounting literature in 2019 the company was required to perform an annual impairment test as of the first day of its third quarter of 2019 july 1 and also on december 1 to ensure that the change in impairment testing date would not delay or avoid an impairment charge there were no goodwill impairment charges as a result of the companys 2019 annual goodwill impairment testing performed in the third quarter at july 1 2019 or in the fourth quarter at december 1 2019 

during the third quarter impairment testing the company recorded impairment charges of 607 million within the appliances and cookware segment the carrying value of certain appliances and cookware tradenames exceeded their fair value primarily due to the recently announced tariffs on chinese imports at the time of the third quarter impairment testing as well as a decline in sales volume due to a loss in market share for certain appliance categories from newly launched competitive products both of these factors resulted in downward revisions to forecasted results in addition in the home and outdoor living segment impairment charges of 151 million and 658 million were recorded within the home fragrance and outdoor and recreation reporting units respectively the carrying value of certain home and outdoor living tradenames exceeded their fair value primarily within the home fragrance reporting unit the reporting unit has begun to experience a shift in product mix that is expected to continue into the future which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment testing the company recorded impairment charges of 524 million within the home and outdoor living segment the carrying value of certain tradenames in the outdoor and recreation reporting unit exceeded their fair value primarily due to downward revisions to forecasted results subsequent to the third quarter impairment testing  in addition in the learning and development segment impairment charges of 242 million were recorded as the carrying value of a tradename in the writing reporting unit exceeded its fair value primarily due to a faster than anticipated deterioration in sales for slimerelated adhesive products which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames 

in addition to the charges recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing in 2019 the company recorded in continuing operations approximately 311 million of additional impairment charges which reflect the decreases in carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for mapa and quickie while these businesses were classified as held for sale in 2019 the company also recorded an impairment charge of approximately 115 million in continuing operations in connection with an overstatement of the companys state income tax receivable partially offset by a 88 million benefit in continuing operations related to change in uncertain tax position additional impairment charges of 112 million were recorded in discontinued operations for businesses divested in 2019

see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

impact of tariffs 

the united states trade representative “ustr” has imposed increased tariffs on some chinese goods imported into the united states resulting in increased costs for the company the company has been successful at securing from the ustr exemptions and exclusions for some of our products with the most notable exemptions being for our baby gear which represents a substantial 

portion of the company’s tariff exposure the company’s gross tariff exposure from the existing tariffs on chinese goods was approximately 70 million for 2019 the company has largely mitigated its tariff exposure in part through pricing productivity and in some cases relocation the phase 1 agreement signed on january 15 2020 with china reduced tariffs under list 4a from 15 to 75 effective february 14 2020 and suspended tariffs under list 4b at 15 which was due to go into effect on december 15 2019 the terms of the agreement significantly reduced the estimated impact on tariffs for 2020 in spite of the agreement a full year of previously implemented tariffs could have a material impact on the companys operating results and cash flows with an estimated gross impact of approximately 90 million in 2020 primarily relating to our appliances and cookware consumer and commercial and outdoor and recreation businesses the company will continue to monitor the trade negotiations and deploy mitigation efforts to offset the gross exposure however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its mitigation efforts 

new treasury regulations 

on june 18 2019 the us treasury and the internal revenue service released temporary regulations under section 245a as enacted by the 2017 tax reform and the temporary regulations to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 tax reform was enacted the temporary regulations seek to limit the 100 dividends received deduction permitted by section 245a for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations before the retroactive application of the temporary regulations the company benefited in 2018 from both the 100 dividends received deduction and the lookthrough exception to foreign personal holding company income the company has analyzed the temporary regulations and concluded that the relevant temporary regulations were not validly issued therefore the company has not accounted for the effects of the temporary regulations in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending december 31 2019 the company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations as well as a potential litigation process there can be no assurances that the relevant temporary regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the company if the company’s position on the temporary regulations is not sustained the company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately 180 million to 220 million related to an income tax benefit from the 2018 year that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time in addition the company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties the company intends to vigorously defend its position 

coronavirus 

the company’s global operations expose it to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics which could harm its business and cause operational results to suffer in december 2019 and january 2020 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in wuhan china has resulted in travel disruption and an impact on corporate operations in china at this point the exact extent to which the coronavirus may impact the company’s supply chain or results of operations is uncertain however revenues may be impacted in the first half of 2020

business segment operating results 2019 vs 2018

operating income increased to 587 million in 2019 as compared to 238 million in 2018 operating income and operating margins 

improved primarily due to lower noncash impairment charges of certain indefinitelived intangible assets of 248 million recorded in 2019 as compared to 351 million of noncash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangible assets recorded in 2018 the increase in operating income also included overhead reduction driven by various initiatives in the current year and the lapping of a bad debt write off from a large customer in the prior year partially offset by higher advertising and promotion costs in the current year and net insurance recoveries from a firerelated loss in the prior year

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2019 the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 349 million  of which approximately 331 million was held by the company’s nonus subsidiaries overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operations access to capital markets and availability under its facility defined hereafter and securitization facility defined hereafter will be adequate to support the cash needs of the company the company intends to use available cash borrowing capacity cash flows from future operations divestiture proceeds and alternative financing arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the company’s growth platforms to maintain its dividend per share to pay down debt and debt maturities as they come due and to complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives in addition the company had restricted cash of 223 million at december 31 2019 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash changed as follows for 2019 2018 and 2017 in millions 



the company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers 

factors affecting liquidity 

on november 1 2019 sp downgraded the company’s debt rating to “bb” based on a view that the company would fail to meet sp’s target debt level for 2019 moody’s continues to maintain its investment grade debt rating for the company at december 31 2019 the company could borrow up to approximately 800 million under its commercial paper program as a result of the downgrade the company’s ability to borrow under its commercial paper program will be adversely affected for a period of time either through an increase in interest costs on borrowings under the commercial paper program or limitations on or elimination of the company’s ability to access the commercial paper market the company does not expect any overall change in its ability to access liquidity in the short term as a result of the downgrade at december 31 2019 the company had 250 million outstanding under our commercial paper program 

limitations on access to the commercial paper program may require the company to borrow additional funds under the facility the company’s ability to borrow under the facility will not be affected by the downgrade the interest rate for borrowings under the facility would be onemonth libor plus 105 basis points the companys facility requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the companys ability to borrow under the facility at the time of filing this annual report on form 10k the company is compliant with its financial covenants see footnote 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the facility 

in addition certain of the company’s senior notes aggregating to approximately 45 billion in principal amount outstanding are subject to an interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points as a result of the downgrade this increase to the interest rates of the senior notes subject to adjustment is expected to increase the company’s annualized interest expense by approximately 11 million  

furthermore the company may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease as a result of the downgrade 

cash flows from operating activities 

the change in operating activities from continuing operations for 2019 is primarily due to favorable working capital management as a result of the company’s continued focus on improving its working capital there was a decrease in accounts receivable due to better terms compliance as a result of improvements in the company’s dispute resolution process and accounts receivable sold under the new customer receivables purchase agreement see “capital resources” operating cash flow also benefited from a decrease in cash paid for interest and income taxes of approximately 153 million and 136 million  respectively 

the change in operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 is in part due to an increase in cash taxes paid approximately 135 million  related to the gain on the sale of the tools business lower payables in 2018 and favorable working capital benefits in 2017 related to the divested businesses partially offset by strong inventory management and other working capital initiatives and timing as well as lower bonus and incentive payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

the change in investing activities from continuing operations for 2019 was primarily due to cash received by the company in the prior year for insurance claims which include a claim from firerelated losses and settlement of a note receivable related to a legacy jarden investment for 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures from continuing operations were 248 million and 263 million  respectively 

the change in investing activities from continuing operations for 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of businesses approximately 21 billion  partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses approximately 634 million  for 2018 and 2017 capital expenditures from continuing operations were 263 million and 292 million  respectively 

cash flows from financing activities 

the change in financing activities for 2019 was primarily due to the yearoveryear change in debt approximately 22 billion  and a decrease in shares repurchased approximately 15 billion  partially offset by payments to dissenting shareholders in 2019 approximately 171 million  in connection with the jarden acquisition see footnote 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the dissenting shareholders settlement from the jarden acquisition 

the change in financing activities for 2018 was primarily due to the periodoverperiod decrease in borrowings on shortterm debt approximately 10 billion  an increase in shares repurchased approximately 14 billion  and an increase in the payments on longterm debt approximately 11 billion  partially offset by payments to dissenting shareholders in 2017 approximately 162 million  in connection with the jarden acquisition 

capital resources 

the company maintains a 125 billion revolving credit facility that matures in december 2023 the “facility” under the facility the company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms since the facility provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper the company may issue commercial paper up to a maximum of 800 million provided there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the facility the facility also provides for the issuance of up to 100 million of letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the facility at december 31 2019 there was 250 million of commercial paper outstanding there were approximately 20 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued against the facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility the net availability under the facility was approximately 12 billion see footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in june 2019 the company entered into a new factoring agreement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables at a more attractive discount rate than its previous cash discount terms offered to these customers the “customer receivables purchase agreement” the company received approximately 201 million under the new agreement during the second quarter of 2019 the balance of the factored receivables at december 31 2019 remained substantially unchanged from the balance at june 30 2019 transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable and the receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sales transaction the company classifies the proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable as an operating cash flow in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company records the discount as other expense income net in the consolidated statement of operations 

in october 2019 the company refinanced its then existing receivables purchase agreement the new 600 million receivables purchase agreement matures in october 2022 the “securitization facility” and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate 

the company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at december 31 2019 

under the company’s then existing srp which expired on december 31 2019 and was not extended the company could repurchase up to approximately 36 billion of its outstanding common stock through a combination of 10b51 automatic trading plans discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions during 2019 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under its existing srp 

risk management 

from time to time the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 

interest rate contracts 

the company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps the company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest floating rate swaps would be used depending on market conditions to convert the fixed rates of longterm debt into shortterm variable rates fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision the cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense 

fair value hedges 

at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 377 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for variable rate libor of interest plus a weighted average spread these floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against 277 million of principal on the 47 senior notes due 2020 and 100 million of principal on the 40 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes for the remaining life of these notes the effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt 

during 2019 the company terminated approximately 150 million notional amount of these floating rate swaps and received consideration of 56 million  which is included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2019 these floating rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges were terminated in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of the principal balance of the 2024 notes pursuant to the tender offers see footnote 10 the termination of these floating rate swaps resulted in a total gain of 57 million  which is included in loss on extinguishment for 2019 in the consolidated statements of operations 

crosscurrency contracts 

the company uses crosscurrency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries during 2018 all the company’s crosscurrency interest rate swaps matured the crosscurrency interest rate swaps were intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and british pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements 

foreign currency contracts 

the company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through december 2020 the derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 516 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales 

the company also uses foreign currency contracts primarily forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 667 million notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through december 2020 fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other income expense net 

commodity contracts 

to a lesser extent the company also enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the risk that the rising price of these commodities could have on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials these commoditybased derivatives provide the company with cost certainty at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 01 million notional amount outstanding of commoditybased derivatives that are designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through january 2020 fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in cost of products sold 

the following table presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments at december 31 2019 in millions 



contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received at december 31 2019 and other noncancelable obligations including capital assets and other licensing services 

the following table summarizes the effect that material contractual obligations and commitments are expected to have on the company’s cash flow in the indicated period at december 31 2019 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements 





 

the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 474 million in unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 63 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

at december 31 2019 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and are recognized at a point in time which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms which is also when control is transferred the company’s primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of its consumer and commercial products to its customers 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services certain customers may receive cash andor noncash incentives such as cash discounts returns credits or reimbursements related to defective products customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other customerrelated programs which are accounted for as variable consideration in some cases the company must apply judgment including contractual rates and historical payment trends when estimating variable consideration 

in addition the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

certain costs and cash payments made to customers previously recorded in costs of products sold and selling general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction of net sales as they do not meet the specific criteria to qualify as a distinct good or service primarily related to payments to customers for defective products under warranty 

sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue the company elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost as permitted by the standard the company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for i contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and ii contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the company has the right to invoice for services performed 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

business combinations 

the company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships tradenames and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology the period of time the company expects to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates in estimating the future cash flows the company considers demand competition and other economic factors the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses 

the company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or tradename has an indefinite life in assessing whether an acquired trademark or tradename has an indefinite life the company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life customer loyalty brand strength and positioning the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors the company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or tradename into its brand portfolio and the company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets the company considers all other acquired intangible assets definitelived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straightline basis the company determines the amortizable life of acquired definitelived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset 

the company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results as a result the company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles have historically been tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the third quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant during the second quarter of 2019 the company changed the date of its annual impairment testing from july 1 to december 1 the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s annual planning and budgeting process as well as its longterm planning and forecasting process 

pursuant to the authoritative accounting literature in 2019 the company was required to perform an annual impairment testing as of the first day of its third quarter of 2019 july 1 as well as december 1 to ensure that the change in impairment testing date did not delay or avoid an impairment charge as such the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at july 1 2019 and december 1 2019 at which dates the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles attributable to continuing operations were 



goodwill 

goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units reporting units are determined based upon the company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level as a result of the atp which resulted in a number of businesses designated as held for sale as well as the company’s decision to retain the commercial business the company’s continuing operations are comprised of eight reporting units within its four primary operating segments 

in 2019 the company bypassed the qualitative approach to testing goodwill and used a quantitative approach which involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between these amounts limited to the amount of reporting unit goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

the quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and the estimation of future cash flows business growth rates terminal values discount rates and total enterprise value the income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on fiveyear cash flow projections the cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debtfree” basis before cash payments to equity and interestbearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit a provision is made based on these projections for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period or terminal value the present value of the finiteperiod cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate the company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting the latest projections which included among other things the impact of tariffs on chinese imports as well as other inflation at the time for the company’s impairment testing performed during the third and fourth quarter of 2019 

the fair values of each of the reporting units in both the third and fourth quarters of 2019 exceeded the respective carrying values of the reporting units consequently there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2019 as a result of the impairment testing performed during the third and fourth quarter see footnote 8 to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter impairment testing all of the company’s reporting units with the exception of appliances and cookware fair value exceeded their respective carrying value by more than 10 an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rates used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the appliances and cookware reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 66 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 

although the company did not have any impaired goodwill in 2019 in conjunction with its annual impairment testing the company recorded impairment charges of 158 million in continuing operations in 2019 which reflect the decreases in carrying values of goodwill for mapaspontex and quickie while these businesses were classified as held for sale in 2019 the company also recorded an impairment charge of approximately 115 million in continuing operations in connection with a prior period overstatement of the companys state income tax receivable partially offset by a 88 million benefit in continuing operations related to change in uncertain tax positions also related to a prior period 

see footnotes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

indefinitelived intangibles 

the testing of indefinitelived intangibles primarily trademarks and tradenames under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as cash flow projections royalty rates terminal values and discount rates for impairment testing purposes the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial value the first method is the relief from royalty method which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset the second method the excess earnings method estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual or excess cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present the excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital tangible assets and other intangible assets changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company recorded impairment charges of 824 million related to various tradenames within its reporting units as follows 

 

 

there were no impairments of the company’s tradenames within the learning and development or food and commercial segments during the third quarter of 2019 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company recorded impairment charges of approximately 766 million related to various tradenames within its reporting units as follows 

 

 

the remaining tradenames within the companys home and outdoor living and learning and development segments with no impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment test had carrying values of 11 billion and 433 million  respectively with 555 million and 241 million of those with fair values in excess of 10 of carrying values respectively an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the home and outdoor living and learning and development tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 41 million and 21 million  respectively 

there were no impairments of the company’s tradenames within the appliances and cookware or food and commercial segments during the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment test the remaining carrying value of tradenames within these segments were approximately 146 million and 12 billion  respectively with 115 million and 854 million of those tradenames with fair values 

in excess of 10 of the carrying values respectively an increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the appliances and cookware and food and commercial tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 2 million and 30 million  respectively 

  

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates credit ratings foreign exchange rates labor inflation tariffs and industry growth given the current trade negotiations with china and the uncertainties regarding the financial potential impact on the companys business there can be no assurance that the companys estimates and assumptions regarding the impact of tariffs made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future the company’s appliances and cookware consumer and commercial and outdoor and recreation businesses units are most sensitive to changes in tariffs while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets it is possible changes could occur as for all the company’s reporting units if in future years the reporting unit’s actual results are not consistent with the company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value the company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets the company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment the company may be required to perform additional impairment testing based on changes in the economic environment disruptions to the company’s business significant declines in operating results of the company’s reporting units andor tradenames further sustained deterioration of the company’s market capitalization and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity or the market capitalization deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

in addition to the charges recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing in 2019 the company recorded in continuing operations approximately 153 million of additional impairment charges which reflect the decreases in carrying values of indefinitelived intangible assets in the mapaspontex and quickie businesses while they were classified as held for sale additional impairment charges of 112 million were recorded in discontinued operations for businesses divested in 2019 

see footnote 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

valuation of assets held for sale 

at december 31 2019 the company did not have any disposal groups classified as held for sale upon designation as held for sale the company’s disposal groups are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the disposal groups to their carrying values the fair value of the disposal groups is estimated using a market multiple approach the company uses various assumptions to estimate fair value under the market multiple approach including estimating the market multiples expected from the eventual sale of the disposal groups based on information obtained as a result of its marketing process see footnote 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during 2019 as the result of the company’s valuation assessment of its disposal groups which included the mapaspontex and quickie businesses prior to the company’s decision to retain such businesses the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of 158 million specifically related to the mapaspontex and quickie businesses and indefinitelived tradename impairment charges of 153 million specifically related to the mapaspontex and quickie businesses these impairment charges totaling 311 million are included in the company’s consolidated statement of operations for 2019 in the food and commercial segment as a result of the company’s decision to retain such businesses which results have been reclassified to continuing operations in the company’s consolidated statement of operations 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values capitalized implementation costs for certain qualified cloud computing software as a service arrangements are included in prepaid expenses and other current in the consolidated balance sheets and the straightline amortization of the costs is presented along with the fees related to the hosted cloud computing service in the consolidated statements of operations 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment operating leases and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group early termination of an operating lease a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value 

income taxes 

the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors the pension and postretirement obligations are measured at december 31 for 2019 and 2018 

the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of pension plan assets the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us largecapitalization stocks us smallcapitalization stocks and international securities investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

the expected longterm rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations historical asset returns current and expected future market conditions risk and active management premiums the target asset allocations for the company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan based in part due to plan demographics funded status and liability duration in general the company’s target asset allocations are as follows equities approximately 20 to 40 fixed income approximately 40 to 60 and cash alternative investments and other approximately 10 to 30 at december 31 2019 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions the company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans the asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile at december 31 2019 the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows equities approximately 19 and other investments alternative investments fixedincome securities cash and other approximately 81 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions 

for 2019 2018 and 2017 the actual return loss on plan assets for the company’s us pension plan assets was approximately 213 million 71 million and 172 million respectively versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately 59 million 68 million and 73 million respectively the actual amount of future contributions will depend in part on longterm actual return on assets and future discount rates pension contributions for all the company’s pension plans for 2020 are estimated to be approximately 24 million which is consistent with the 2019 contributions 

the weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2019 was approximately 44 for the company’s pension plans the weighted average discount rate at the 2019 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 27 and 28 respectively a 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2019 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately 61 million 

the healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers at the 2019 measurement date the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 67 the current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 45 a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs 

see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans 

restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs and other exit costs associated with restructuring activities 

the companys accrual for severance and other employee separation costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are onetime costs the company accounts for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts or historical experience if applicable the company recognize these costs when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable 

the company estimates the onetime severance and other employee costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated the company recognizes these costs when we identify the specific classification or functions of the employees being terminated notify the employees who might be included in the termination and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period when employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in general business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices and that can affect the cost of operating investing and financing under those conditions the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks the company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt as such the company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs at december 31 2019 approximately 377 million of the company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps the remainder of the debt approximately 53 billion  carries a fixed rate of interest based upon the company’s debt structure at december 31 2019 a hypothetical 1 increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately 38 million and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 323 million  

while the company transacts business predominantly in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars a substantial portion of the company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies such as the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar european euro japanese yen and mexican peso changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses for 2019 approximately 33 of the company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies the most significant of which were european euro approximately 10  and canadian dollar approximately 4  the primary purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives 

the company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials as such the company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the company enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials a hypothetical 10 change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the company’s results of operations in this sensitivity analysis all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments all of which are highly rated institutions however the company does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties 

the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer “management” has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as required by rule 13a15b of the exchange act and has concluded that certain of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of december 31 2019 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k due to the material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting as described below 

management has also concluded that notwithstanding the existence of the material weaknesses the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k present fairly in all material respects the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with us gaap in addition to the remediation efforts management has undertaken to address the previously identified material weakness additional corrective actions are being taken to address the newly identified weakness both efforts are described below under the section “remediation efforts with respect to the material weaknesses” 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined by rule 13a15f of the exchange act the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with gaap the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate as required by rule 13a15 under the exchange act management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2019 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth in the ‘internal control  integrated framework’ 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the company continues to have a material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in management’s assessment of the internal control over financial reporting in item 9a controls and procedures of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 the “2018 form 10k” the company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for the impact of the divestitures specifically the company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure that deferred taxes were included completely and accurately in the carrying values of assets held for sale and that the intraperiod tax allocation between continuing and discontinued operations was accurate in addition the company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure that the current and noncurrent classification of assets and liabilities held for sale was accurate 

the company did not maintain effective controls to ensure changes in the underlying data utilized in determining the estimated fair value were complete and accurate and to ensure that the expected form of sale of the disposal groups were appropriately reflected in the company’s impairment tests collectively these deficiencies resulted in errors recorded as of and for the quarter ended december 31 2019 relating to prior periods impacting deferred tax liabilities current tax benefit and loss from continuing and discontinued operations net of tax the revision of the company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 adjustments to the assets and liabilities held for sale loss from discontinued operations net of tax and net loss and deferred income taxes accounts to the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 2018 adjustments to the income tax benefit to continuing operations loss from continuing operations and loss from discontinued operations net of tax for the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 assets and liabilities held for sale and other balance sheet accounts primarily deferred income taxes at december 31 2018 and the current and noncurrent classification of assets and liabilities held for sale at december 31 2018 any of these control deficiencies could result in additional misstatements of the company’s aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly management has determined that these control deficiencies continue to constitute a material weakness 

additionally the company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for certain aspects of income taxes specifically the company did not design and maintain controls related to the completeness and accuracy of accounting for state income tax and over the accuracy of determining uncertain tax positions including but not limited to verifying the accrued interest associated with uncertain tax positions was properly determined and recorded these deficiencies resulted in errors recorded as of and for the quarter ended december 31 2019 impacting the current tax benefit for the quarter ended december 31 2019 and goodwill other assets deferred tax liabilities other noncurrent liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31 2019 additionally in aggregate these control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of the company’s aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly management has determined that these control deficiencies in aggregate constitute a material weakness 

because of the material weaknesses management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december 31 2019 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2019 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp as stated in their report as set forth under item 8 of this 2019 annual report 

remediation efforts with respect to the material weaknesses 

management previously reported a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in its 2018 annual report on form 10k filed on march 4 2019 and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q related to accounting for the impact of divestitures management believes it has designed and implemented measures to remediate certain of the deficiencies resulting in the material weakness as of december 31 2019 specific remedial actions implemented by management include 

 

management has effectively designed and tested the operating effectiveness related to the review of the held for sale footnote reconciliation process review and approval process for the underlying data utilized in determining the estimated fair value and expected form of sale reflected in the company’s impairment tests however this material weakness will not be considered remediated until management has concluded through testing of divestiture transactions or otherwise that each component of the material weakness is operating effectively as needed for a sufficient period of time 

during the course of 2019 management made certain changes as part of the remediation of the material weakness related to accounting for divestitures which relate to the material weakness for accounting for income taxes and which the company believes will contribute to the remediation efforts of the material weakness these changes include 

 

subsequent to the identification of the material weakness for accounting for income taxes management began to implement a tax reporting software solution that has enhanced our visibility of uncertain tax positions in order to remediate the material weakness 

the company plans to implement the following additional steps to remediate the material weakness for accounting for income taxes 

 

while management believes that it now has the requisite personnel to operate the controls in the tax function and the remediation actions described above should remediate the material weakness with respect to accounting for income taxes as management continues the remediation process it may determine certain additional enhancements are necessary this material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively the company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2019 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores craft stores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors ecommerce companies and yankee candle retail stores additionally we distribute our jostens and waddington products through the academic and achievement channel and foodservice channel respectively the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with the company’s products the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished our yankee candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers including department stores gift stores and national specialty retailers that carry candles

 item 1a risk factors 

the ownership of the company’s common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to invest in the company’s securities the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks that are currently unknown to the company or that the company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe latin america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside of the us there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions such events could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large retailers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future for example the company’s results in 2017 were impacted negatively by the reorganization filing of a major customer in the baby division within the live segment in particular a loss of or a failure by one of the company’s large customers could adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s sales are dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the company’s future financial performance 

the company’s customer base is relatively fragmented although the company has longestablished relationships with many customers the company generally does not have any longterm supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers purchases by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders as a result these customers may cancel their orders change purchase quantities from forecast volumes delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship significant or numerous cancellations reductions delays in purchases or changes in business practices or by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition because many of the company’s costs are fixed a reduction in customer demand could have an adverse effect on the company’s gross profit margins and operating income 

the company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large highvolume retail customers however the company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to 

 

  

  

 the company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers a substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could materially adversely affect its sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades the company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain which could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at 

 

the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in future pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would materially adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion the company is currently in the process of delivering the cost synergies related to the acquisition of jarden both efforts are global initiatives designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms project renewal and the company’s cost saving plans associated with the jarden integration may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated in addition such initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

the company incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the jarden acquisition which could materially adversely affect the company and its financial position including decreasing its business flexibility and increasing its borrowing costs 

the company incurred an additional 65 billion of debt excluding approximately 41 billion of jarden debt refinanced in connection with the acquisition in connection with the completion of the jarden acquisition following completion of the jarden acquisition the company substantially increased its debt compared to its recent historical levels this increased level of debt will increase the company’s interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing the company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions in addition if the company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness the company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debttocapitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

while the vast majority of the company’s debt is fixed fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and 

 

other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however in both december 2015 and december 2016 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate each time by a quarter of a percentage point in 2017 the us federal reserve again raised its benchmark interest rate in march june and december each time by a quarter of a percentage point while it is unclear whether such action over the last three years suggests a change in previous monetary policy positions any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted 

the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remain important factors in the company’s future growth in 2017 the company completed the acquisitions of sistema plastics a new zealandbased provider of food storage containers primarily under the sistema ® brand smith mountain industries a provider of home fragrance products primarily under the woodwick ® candle and chesapeake bay candle ® brands a leading developer manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance products focused on consumer wellness and natural fragrance in april 2016 the company completed the acquisition of jarden corporation which had recently acquired jostens inc and waddington group inc the company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated and manage unanticipated demands on the company’s management operational resources and financial and internal control systems furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital the company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring and integrating a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continually evaluates the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products in june 2016 the company completed the sale of its décor business which comprised its levolor ® and kirsch ® window coverings brands in march 2017 the company completed the sale of its tools business which comprised the irwin ® lenox ® and hilmor ® brands in july 2017 the company completed the sale of its winter sports business which included the völkl ® and k2 ® brands in the third quarter of 2017 the company completed the sale of the remaining portions of its rubbermaid ® consumer storage totes business the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit on january 25 2018 the company announced that it will explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value the components of that plan include exploring the sale of a number of the industrial commercial and small consumer businesses such as waddington process solutions rubbermaid commercial products mapa rawlings goody rubbermaid outdoor closet refuse and garage and us playing cards a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services 

 

pricing and availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control including general domestic and international economic conditions natural disasters labor costs production levels competition consumer demand import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates for example in 2017 the company’s results were negatively impacted by raw material and transportation cost inflation and shortages resulting from hurricanes in the united states this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials energy transportation and other supplies and services for the company and may therefore have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products during periods of rising prices of raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers conversely when raw material prices decline customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and to the extent the company has existing inventory lower margins as a result fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the products the company manufactures require particular types of glass metal paper plastic resin wax wood or other materials supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s operations are dependent upon thirdparty vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the company’s business operations 

the company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties the company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products in many cases the company does not enter into longterm contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers instead buying parts and products on a “purchase order” basis as a result the company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 

the ability of thirdparty suppliers to timely deliver finished goods andor raw materials and the ability of the company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns or significant weather and health conditions affecting manufacturers andor shippers any adverse change in the company’s relationships with its thirdparty suppliers the financial condition of thirdparty suppliers the ability of thirdparty suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis or the company’s ability to import products from thirdparty suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial condition of the company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations for example certain businesses in the baby division have a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply go out of business or discontinue a particular component the company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner if at all any inability of the company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the company 

the company cannot assure you that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose and the company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its thirdparty suppliers the company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products 

changes in foreign cultural political and financial market conditions could impair the company’s international operations and financial performance 

some of the company’s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed such as brazil or where economies have suffered economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls may not be sustainable and as a result the company’s sales or 

 

profits related to those countries may decline the economies of other foreign countries important to the company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation in the future the company’s international operations and particularly its business in emerging markets including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of the company’s customers are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the company including among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 should any of these risks occur the company’s ability to manufacture source sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired the company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations andor the company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

the company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the financial position and results of operations of many of the company’s international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the company’s financial statements the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the company’s reported sales operating margin and operating income and conversely the weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact for the year ended december 31 2017 foreign currency favorably affected reported sales by 34 million compared to prior year however the volatility of foreign exchange rates is unpredictable and could materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company realizes margin impacts from changes in foreign currency because the company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely denominated in us dollars and the company’s international operations generally sell the company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies when local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar in the regions in which the company sells products whose costs are denominated in us dollars the company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products andor reduce costs through productivity or other initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability the company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics competition or otherwise and may not realize cost reductions through productivity or other initiatives as a result gross margins and overall operating results of the company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens 

the company has been adversely impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that have occurred in recent years the declining availability of us dollars and the implementation of pricing and exchange controls in venezuela as of december 31 2015 the company determined that it no longer could exercise control over the operations of its venezuela subsidiary accordingly the company deconsolidated its venezuela subsidiary on december 31 2015 and recorded a pretax charge of 173 million 

 

future government actions including but not limited to currency devaluations import authorization controls foreign exchange controls price or profit controls or expropriation or other forms of government takeover could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data the company’s operations especially its retail operations involve the storage and transmission of employees’ customers’ and consumers’ proprietary information such as credit card and bank account numbers the company’s payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes including unauthorized use of credit cards debit cards or bank account information identity theft or merchant fraud if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations a risk of government enforcement action litigation and possible liability and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of the company’s security occurs the public perception of the effectiveness of the company’s security measures could be harmed and the company could lose customers and consumers which could adversely affect its business 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be materially impacted see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 

in addition to operational standards environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination accordingly the company may be liable either contractually or by operation of law for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the company is a landfill or other location where it has disposed wastes or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the company’s ownership or operation of the property given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the company and others at these properties there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted the company does not believe that any of the company’s existing remediation obligations including at thirdparty sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect upon its business results of operations or financial condition however future events such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown contamination may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material see “environmental matters” under footnote 19 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 for a further discussion of these and other environmentalrelated matters 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s success at implementing project renewal the growth game plan the integration of jarden and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

the company’s business involves the potential for product recalls product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition 

 

as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products the company is subject to the consumer products safety act of 1972 which empowers the consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions under certain circumstances the consumer products safety commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products additionally other laws and agencies such as the national highway transportation safety administration regulate certain consumer products sold by the company in the united states and abroad and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future any repurchase or recall of the company’s products could be costly and damaging to the company’s reputation if the company were required to remove or it voluntarily removed its products from the market the company’s reputation could be tarnished and the company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell the company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage bodily injury or other adverse effects in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products 

although the company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable that insurance is in most cases subject to large selfinsured retentions for which the company is responsible and the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms if at all in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage additionally the company does not maintain product recall insurance as a result product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition the company faces potential other types of litigation arising out of alleged defects in its products or otherwise such as class action lawsuits the company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage the company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards however compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk as a result these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrencebased program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance the company currently either selfinsures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company’s individual per occurrence selfinsured retention the company cannot assure you however that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to selfinsured retention will not be material 

see footnote 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigationrelated matters 

if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products which could adversely affect the company’s market share and results of operations 

the company’s success with its proprietary products depends in part on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights including its patent and trademark rights if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products 

the company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products the company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products the company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the company receives or licenses in addition patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company’s products 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly the company’s cost of capital the company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” or standard  poor’s ratings services “standard  poor’s” which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade would increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results specifically the interest rate payable on notes issued in march 2016 are subject to adjustment from time to time if either moody’s or standard  poor’s downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the notes though the interest on these notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in ratings by either credit rating agency if such notes become rated “baa1” or higher by moody’s and “bbb” or higher by standard  poors in each case with stable or positive outlook in addition in the event of a reduction in credit rating the company would likely be 

 

required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets expected health care costs or mortality rates the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

damage to the company’s reputation could have an adverse effect on the company’s business  

maintaining the company’s strong reputation with consumers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the company’s continued success adverse publicity about the company its brands corporate practices or any other issue that may be associated with the company whether or not deserved could jeopardize that reputation such adverse publicity could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the company or its brands damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s brands could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to repair the harm 

governmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the company’s business operations 

the company is subject to various federal state and foreign laws and regulations responding to governmental investigations or actions by regulatory bodies may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to the company’s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the company’s business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact the company’s global business 

as of december 31 2017 the company had approximately 49000 employees 12000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute the company periodically negotiates with certain unions representing company employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all all of which may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 

a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could result in potential operational disruption divert our resources and could potentially result in adverse consequences under certain of our debt documents and other agreements 

on february 8 2018 starboard value and opportunity master fund ltd “starboard” delivered a letter to us nominating 10 director candidates for election to the board at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders the “2018 annual meeting” if starboard is successful it is possible that starboardnominated directors could constitute a majority of the board following the 2018 annual meeting 

 

a proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and could result in potential operational disruption further any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if starboard is able to replace a majority of our existing board members such a substantial board turnover may constitute a change of control for purposes of our indentures and notes issued thereunder in such event absent amendment consent or other action certain outstanding series of our debt may require that we make a change of control offer at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest if the change of control is accompanied by a rating event which generally would require among other things a downgrade of our debt rating below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies within specified time periods in addition a change of control under these notes could absent amendment consent or other action trigger a termination event under our securitization facility in the event starboard proceeds with its threatened election contest the company and its board will evaluate what amendments consents determinations or technical actions could or should be made to address the potential adverse consequences to the company from a potential change of control with respect to any outstanding indebtedness 

further a change in a majority of the board may under certain circumstances result in a change of control under employment security agreements we have with our executive management as well as our 2013 incentive plan and equity based awards issued thereunder pursuant to the agreements and awards certain payments and vesting provisions may be triggered following a change of control either immediately or conditioned upon a qualifying termination that occurs within 24 months of any such change of control 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

risk management 

from time to time the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 

interest rate contracts 

the company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps the company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest floating rate swaps would be used depending on market conditions to convert the fixed rates of longterm debt into shortterm variable rates fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision the cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense 

 

fair value hedges

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

customer programs 

the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

business combinations 

the company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology the period of time the company expects to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates in estimating the future cash flows the company considers demand competition and other economic factors the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition 

the company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life in assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life the company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life customer loyalty brand strength and positioning the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors the company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets the company considers all other acquired intangible assets definitelived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straightline basis the company determines the amortizable life of acquired definitelived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

the company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results as a result the company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

as a result of acquisitions in prior years the company has significant intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles primarily trademarks and tradenames the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the third quarter which coincides with the company’s annual planning process or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant in 2017 the company adopted authoritative accounting guidance that requires that goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill which removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to calculate an impairment 

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level as a result of the integration of businesses from the jarden acquisition and related changes to management the company identified 18 reporting units comprising the company’s five operating segments the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1 2017 at which date the company’s total goodwill was 105 billion additionally the carrying value of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets was approximately 102 billion as of the july 1 2017 

the company uses a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test the qualitative approach which was only applied to a portion of the company’s reporting units assesses various factors including in part the macroeconomic environment industry and market specific conditions financial performance operating costs and cost impacts as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit if necessary the next step in the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss would be recognized not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill due to changes in the company’s reportable segments resulting from the integration of businesses from the jarden acquisition and significant future projected synergies the company proceeded directly to quantitative impairment testing for nearly all its reporting units 

both qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions including the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and the estimation of future cash flows business growth rates terminal values and discount rates the company uses various valuation methods such as the discounted cash flow and market multiple methods the income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on fiveyear cash flow projections the cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debtfree” basis before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit a provision is also made based on these projections for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period or terminal value the present value of the finiteperiod cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate the market multiple methodology involves estimating value based on the trading multiples for comparable public companies multiples are determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that are selected on the basis of operational and economic similarity with the business operations valuation multiples are calculated for the comparable companies based on daily trading prices a comparative analysis between the reporting unit and the public companies forms the basis for the selection of appropriate riskadjusted multiples the comparative analysis incorporates both quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to among other things the nature of the industry in which the reporting unit and other comparable companies are engaged 

the company uses a qualitative approach to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing the company applied this qualitative approach to select indefinitelived intangible assets for the majority of the other indefinitelived intangible assets the company proceeded directly to quantitative impairment testing 

the testing of indefinitelived intangibles under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions such as cash flow projections terminal values and discount rates for impairment testing purposes the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial value the first method is the relief from royalty method which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset the second method is the excess earnings method which estimates the value of 

 

the intangible asset by quantifying the residual or excess cash flows generated by the asset and discounting those cash flows to the present the excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital tangible assets and other intangible assets changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations 

as a result of the 2017 annual impairment testing the enterprise value of all of the company’s reporting units except the winter sports reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by more than approximately 10 however changes in business conditions and assumptions could potentially require future adjustments to these asset valuations 

the company’s winter sports reporting unit was a business held for sale as of the impairment testing date during the second quarter of 2017 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business and used the estimated purchase price approximately 200 million net of working capital adjustments to approximate the enterprise value of the winter sports reporting unit since the carrying value exceeded the estimated enterprise value of the winter sports reporting unit the company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets during second quarter of 2017 

as a result of the annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangibles assets as of july 1 2017 the company determined that none of the indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired should projected revenues and cash flows not be achieved estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in potential future material noncash impairment charges 

the estimated fair values for certain trade names within the live and other segments exceeded their carrying values by less than a 10 threshold this primarily relates to trade names from the recent jarden acquisition that were valued using the relief from royalty method and those tradenames with projected cashflows that are similar to the initial projection amounts used within the initial valuation 

the company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of 20 billion within the appliances  cookware reporting unit noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by 175 million or approximately 9 the company concluded that this trade name is not impaired however a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately 165 million or approximately 8 

in addition the company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of 208 million within the food reporting unit noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by 47 million or approximately 2 the company concluded that this trade name is not impaired however a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately 32 million or approximately 15 and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately 38 million or approximately 18 

the company also performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of 810 million within the gaming reporting unit noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by 62 million or approximately 8 the company concluded that this trade name is not impaired however a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately 10 million or approximately 12 and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately 11 million or approximately 14 

while some of the company’s businesses experienced a revenue decline and decreased profitability in 2017 the company believes that its longterm growth strategy coupled with projected synergies and cost savings resulting from the jarden acquisition supports its fair value conclusions for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the recoverability of these amounts is dependent upon achievement of the company’s projections and the execution of key initiatives related to revenue growth and improved profitability 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates credit ratings foreign exchange rates labor inflation and industry growth while the company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets it is possible changes could occur as for all of the company’s reporting units if in future years the reporting unit’s actual results are not consistent with the company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value the company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill the company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future additionally there are significant synergy savings projected for the company as a result of the jarden acquisition 

 

subsequent events 

in january 2018 the company announced it is exploring strategic options for its industrial and commercial product assets including waddington process solutions rubbermaid commercial products and mapa as well as the smaller consumer businesses including rawlings goody rubbermaid outdoor closet refuse and garage and us playing cards the estimated selling price for each of these businesses is subject to many factors including but not limited to the number of potential buyers buyer’s strategic fit and synergies and nature of the sales transaction the company may incur future impairment charges if the carrying value of the business exceeds its estimated sales price 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value 

 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors the pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of december 31 for 2017 and 2016 

the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of pension plan assets the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us largecapitalization stocks us smallcapitalization stocks and international securities investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

 

the expected longterm rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations historical asset returns current and expected future market conditions risk and active management premiums the target asset allocations for the company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan based in part due to plan demographics funded status and liability duration in general the company’s target asset allocations for the domestic pension plans are as follows equities approximately 25 to 40 bonds approximately 20 to 40 and cash alternative investments and other approximately 25 to 45 as of december 31 2017 actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions the company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans the asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile at december 31 2017 the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows equities approximately 23 and other investments alternative investments fixedincome securities cash and other approximately 77 cash and other asset levels were higher than normal at december 31 2017 due to the impending merger of domestic defined benefit pension plans effective january 1 2018 and the liquidation of certain assets in advance of the merger these assets were subsequently invested in january 2018 in accordance with the company’s target asset allocations 

for 2017 2016 and 2015 the actual return loss on plan assets for the company’s us pension plan assets was approximately 172 million 71 million and 14 million respectively versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately 73 million 69 million and 58 million respectively the actual amount of future contributions will depend in part on longterm actual return on assets and future discount rates pension contributions for all the company’s pension plans for 2018 are estimated to be approximately 30 million compared to approximately 29 million in 2017 

the weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2017 was approximately 49 for the company’s pension plans the weighted average discount rate at the 2017 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 31 and 33 respectively a 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2017 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately 71 million 

the healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers at the 2017 measurement date the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 67 the current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 45 a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs 

see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans 

restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation costs sublease income and other exit costs including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities the company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experience and previously negotiated settlements the company accrues for future lease costs net of management’s estimate for future sublease income when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in general business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices and that can affect the cost of operating investing and financing under those conditions the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks the company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt as such the company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs as of december 31 2017 approximately 11 billion of the company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps the remainder of the debt approximately 94 billion carries a fixed rate of interest based upon the company’s debt structure at december 31 2017 a hypothetical 1 increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately 11 million and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately 743 million 

while the company transacts business predominantly in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars a substantial portion of the company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies such as the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro japanese yen and mexican peso changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses for 2017 approximately 29 of the company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies the most significant of which were european euroapproximately 80 and canadian dollarapproximately 58 the primary purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives 

the company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials as such the company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the company enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials a hypothetical 10 change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the company’s results of operations in this sensitivity analysis all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments all of which are highly rated institutions however the company does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties 

the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

general 

newell brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people make life better every day where they live learn work and play our products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands including paper mate ®  sharpie ®  dymo ®  expo ®  parker ®  elmer’s ®  coleman ®  jostens ®  marmot ®  rawlings ®  irwin ®  lenox ®  oster ®  sunbeam ®  foodsaver ®  mr coffee ®  rubbermaid commercial products ®  graco ®  baby jogger ®  nuk ®  calphalon ®  rubbermaid ®  contigo ®  first alert ®  waddington and yankee candle ®  the company sells its products in nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in nearly 100 of these countries 

this past year was one of the most transformational in its history as the company more than doubled its size and extended its successful operating model across a broader set of categories acquired through the combination with jarden corporation on april 15 2016 jarden corporation “jarden” became a direct whollyowned subsidiary of newell brands inc jarden is a global consumer products company with brands such as yankee candle ®  crockpot ®  foodsaver ®  mr coffee ®  oster ®  coleman ®  first alert ®  rawlings ®  jostens ®  k2 ®  marker ®  marmot ®  völkl ®  and many others following the jarden acquisition the company was renamed newell brands inc 

this transformative transaction created a global consumer goods company with estimated annualized sales for 2016 of 16 billion and a portfolio of leading brands in large growing unconsolidated global markets the scaled enterprise is expected to accelerate profitable growth over time with leading brands in a global market that exceeds 100 billion with business and capability development supported by the efficiencies of the combined company management believes the scale of newell brands in key categories channels and geographies creates a much broader opportunity to deploy the company’s advantaged set of brand development and commercial capabilities for accelerated growth and margin expansion the company’s intent is to design a benchmarked efficient set of structures that support longterm business development 

the company anticipates significant annualized cost synergies will be realized by newell brands driven by efficiencies of scale and efficiencies in procurement cost to serve and infrastructure the company anticipates incremental annualized cost synergies of at least 500 million over four years driven by efficiencies of scale and new efficiencies in procurement cost to serve and infrastructure that the combination unlocks the company currently expects to incur approximately 500 million of restructuring and integrationrelated costs over the same period to generate and unlock the more than 500 million of annualized cost synergies 

after the completion of the jarden acquisition the company initiated a comprehensive strategic assessment of the business and in the third quarter of 2016 launched a new corporate strategy that focuses the portfolio prioritizes investment in the categories with the greatest potential for growth and extends the company’s advantaged capabilities in insights product design innovation and ecommerce to the broadened portfolio the investments in new capabilities are designed to unlock the growth potential of the portfolio and will be funded by a commitment to release cost savings of 800 million through the combination of the completion of project renewal and delivery of 500 million in cost synergies associated with the jarden integration this new corporate strategy is called the new growth game plan and builds on the successful track record of growth acceleration margin development and value creation associated with the transformation of newell rubbermaid inc from 2011 through 2016 

 3

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores craft stores directtoconsumer channels specialty retailers and wholesalers commercial distributors ecommerce companies and yankee candle retail stores additionally we distribute our jostens and waddington products through the academic and achievement channel and foodservice channel respectively the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with the company’s products the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished our yankee candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a

variety of other retailers including department stores gift stores and national specialty retailers that carry candles along with personal care items giftware and housewares

 item 1a risk factors 

the ownership of the company’s common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to invest in the company’s securities the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks that are currently unknown to the company or that the company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe latin america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside of the us there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions such events could negatively 

 10 

impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a loss of or a failure by one of the company’s large customers could adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s sales are dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the company’s future financial performance 

the company’s customer base is relatively fragmented although we have longestablished relationships with many customers the company generally does not have any longterm supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers purchases by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders as a result these customers may cancel their orders change purchase quantities from forecast volumes delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship significant or numerous cancellations reductions delays in purchases or changes in business practices or by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition because many of the company’s costs are fixed a reduction in customer demand could have an adverse effect on the company’s gross profit margins and operating income 

the company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large highvolume retail customers however the company may be unable to continually meet the needs of these customers retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to 

 the company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers a substantial decrease in sales to any of its major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could materially adversely affect its sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades the company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain which could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation 

 11 

the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in future pricing and other competitive pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would materially adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion the company is currently in the process of implementing project renewal and delivering the cost synergies related to the acquisition of jarden both efforts are global initiatives designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms project renewal and the company’s cost saving plans associated with the jarden integration may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated in addition such initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

the company incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the jarden acquisition which could materially adversely affect the company and its financial position including decreasing its business flexibility and increasing its borrowing costs 

the company incurred an additional 65 billion  of debt excluding approximately 41 billion  of jarden debt refinanced in connection with the acquisition in connection with the completion of the jarden acquisition following completion of the jarden acquisition the company substantially increased its debt compared to its recent historical levels this increased level of debt will increase the company’s interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing the company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions in addition if the company is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness the company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debttocapitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company 

 12 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the vast majority of the company’s debt is fixed fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on our business in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however in december 2015 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the first time since 2006 and in december 2016 the us federal reserve again raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point while it is unclear whether such action suggests a change in previous monetary policy positions any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted 

the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remain important factors in the company’s future growth in december 2016 the company announced the acquisition of sistema plastics a new zealandbased provider of food storage containers primarily under the sistema ®  brand in january 2017 the company completed the acquisition of smith mountain industries a provider of home fragrance products primarily under the woodwick ®  candle brand and in april 2016 the company completed the acquisition of jarden corporation which had recently acquired jostens inc and waddington group inc the company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated and manage unanticipated demands on the company’s management operational resources and financial and internal control systems furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital the company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring and integrating a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continually evaluates the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products in june 2016 the company completed the sale of its décor business which comprises its levolor ® and kirsch ® window coverings brands during 2016 the company entered into an agreement to sell its tools business which comprises the irwin ®  lenox ®  and hilmor tm  brands and announced its intention to divest several other businesses and brands including its winter sports business including the völkl ®  and k2 ®  brands and the rubbermaid ®  consumer storage totes business the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the company’s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services 

pricing and availability of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services for use in the company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control including general domestic and international economic 

 13 

conditions labor costs production levels competition consumer demand import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials energy transportation and other supplies and services for the company and may therefore have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products during periods of rising prices of raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers conversely when raw material prices decline customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and to the extent the company has existing inventory lower margins as a result fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the products we manufacture require particular types of glass metal paper plastic resin wax wood or other materials supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s operations are dependent upon thirdparty vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt the company’s business operations 

the company currently sources a significant portion of parts and products from third parties the company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products in many cases the company does not enter into longterm contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers instead buying parts and products on a “purchase order” basis as a result the company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 

the ability of thirdparty suppliers to timely deliver finished goods andor raw materials and the ability of the company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns or significant weather and health conditions such as sars affecting manufacturers andor shippers any adverse change in the company’s relationships with its thirdparty suppliers the financial condition of thirdparty suppliers the ability of thirdparty suppliers to manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis or the company’s ability to import products from thirdparty suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial condition of the company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations for example the company’s baby  parenting business has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of baby  parenting’s sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply go out of business or discontinue a particular component the company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner if at all any inability of the company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the company 

the company cannot assure you that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose and the company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its thirdparty suppliers the company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products 

changes in foreign cultural political and financial market conditions could impair the company’s international operations and financial performance 

some of the company’s operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed such as brazil or where economies have suffered economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been significantly delayed or impaired current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls may not be sustainable and as a result the company’s sales or profits related to those countries may decline the economies of other foreign countries important to the company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic social andor political instability or hyperinflation in the future the company’s international operations and particularly its business in emerging markets including manufacturing and sourcing 

 14 

operations and the international operations of the company’s customers are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the company including among other things 

 should any of these risks occur the company’s ability to manufacture source sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired the company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations andor the company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

the company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the financial position and results of operations of many of the company’s international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the company’s financial statements the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the company’s reported sales operating margin and operating income and conversely the weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact for the year ended december 31 2016  foreign currency unfavorably affected reported sales by 1131 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the volatility of foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the margin impacts from changes in foreign currency are because the company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely denominated in us dollars and the company’s international operations generally sell the company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies when local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar in the regions in which the company sells products whose costs are denominated in us dollars the company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products andor reduce costs through productivity or other initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability the company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics competition or otherwise and may not realize cost reductions through productivity or other initiatives as a result gross margins and overall operating results of the company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens 

the company has been adversely impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that have occurred in recent years the declining availability of us dollars and the implementation of pricing and exchange controls in venezuela as of december 31 2015 the company determined that it no longer could exercise control over the operations of its venezuela subsidiary accordingly the company deconsolidated its venezuela subsidiary on december 31 2015 and recorded a pretax charge of 1727 million  

future government actions such as currency devaluations import authorization controls foreign exchange controls price or profit controls or expropriation or other forms of government takeover could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 15 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data the company’s operations especially its retail operations involve the storage and transmission of employees’ customers’ and consumers’ proprietary information such as credit card and bank account numbers the company’s payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes including unauthorized use of credit cards debit cards or bank account information identity theft or merchant fraud if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations a risk of government enforcement action litigation and possible liability and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of the company’s security occurs the public perception of the effectiveness of the company’s security measures could be harmed and the company could lose customers and consumers which could adversely affect its business 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 16 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

the company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 

in addition to operational standards environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination accordingly the company may be liable either contractually or by operation of law for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by the company is a landfill or other location where it has disposed wastes or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the company’s ownership or operation of the property given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by the company and others at these properties there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted we do not believe that any of the company’s existing remediation obligations including at thirdparty sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect upon its business results of operations or financial condition however future events such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement or the discovery of currently unknown contamination may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material see “environmental matters” under footnote 19 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 for a further discussion of these and other environmentalrelated matters 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s success at implementing project renewal the growth game plan the integration of jarden and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

the company’s business involves the potential for product recalls product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition 

as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products the company is subject to the consumer products safety act of 1972 which empowers the consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the consumer products safety commission could require the company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products additionally other laws and agencies such as the national highway transportation safety administration regulate certain consumer products sold by the company in the united states and abroad and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future any repurchase or recall of the company’s products could be costly and damaging to the company’s reputation if the company were required to remove or it voluntarily removed its products from the market the company’s reputation could be tarnished and the company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell the company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage bodily injury or other adverse effects in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products 

although the company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable that insurance is in most cases subject to large selfinsured retentions for which the company is responsible and the company cannot assure you that it 

 17 

will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms if at all in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage additionally the company does not maintain product recall insurance as a result product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition the company faces potential other types of litigation arising out of alleged defects in its products or otherwise such as class action lawsuits the company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage the company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards however compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk as a result these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrencebased program based on its current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance the company currently either selfinsures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company’s individual per occurrence selfinsured retention the company cannot assure you however that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to selfinsured retention will not be material 

see footnote 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigationrelated matters 

if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products which could adversely affect the company’s market share and results of operations 

the company’s success with its proprietary products depends in part on its ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights including its patent and trademark rights if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights competitors may manufacture and market similar products 

the company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products the company cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products the company also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the company receives or licenses in addition patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company’s products 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly the company’s cost of capital the company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” or standard  poor’s ratings services “standard  poor’s” which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade would increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results specifically the interest rate payable on notes issued in march 2016 are subject to adjustment from time to time if either moody’s or standard  poor’s downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the notes though the interest on these notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in ratings by either credit rating agency if such notes become rated “baa1” or higher by moody’s and bbb or higher by sp in each case with stable or positive outlook in addition in the event of a reduction in credit rating the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted 

 18 

by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets expected health care costs or mortality rates the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition the discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

business overview 

newell brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people get more out of life every day where they live learn work and play our products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands including paper mate ®  sharpie ®  dymo ®  expo ®  parker ®  elmer’s ®  coleman ®  jostens ®  marmot ®  rawlings ®  irwin ®  lenox ®  oster ®  sunbeam ®  foodsaver ®  mr coffee ®  rubbermaid commercial products ®  graco ®  baby jogger ®  nuk ®  calphalon ®  rubbermaid ®  contigo ®  first alert ®  waddington and yankee candle ®  

acquisition of jarden corporation 

on april 15 2016 jarden corporation “jarden” became a direct whollyowned subsidiary of newell brands as a result of a series of merger transactions the “jarden acquisition” the jarden acquisition was effected pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of december 13 2015 the “merger agreement” between the company jarden and two whollyowned subsidiaries of the company following the jarden acquisition the company was renamed newell brands inc jarden is a leading global consumer products company with leading brands such as yankee candle ®  crockpot ®  foodsaver ®  mr coffee ®  oster ®  coleman ®  first alert ®  rawlings ®  jostens ®  k2 ®  marker ®  marmot ®  völkl ®  and many others

 foreign currency  venezuela 

until december 31 2015 the company accounted for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting and therefore the company remeasured assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes “bolivars” into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments were included in earnings as of december 31 2015 the company determined it could no longer exercise control over its venezuela operations because the availability of us dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms as a result the company deconsolidated its venezuelan operations 

prior to the deconsolidation of the venezuela operations on december 31 2015 the results of the company’s venezuelan operations have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of operations for 2015 and all prior periods as of december 31 2015 the company began accounting for its investment in its venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting and the cost basis was adjusted to nil  as of december 31 2015

the company plans to continue operating its business in venezuela since the company holds all of the equity interests but does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the venezuela entity’s economic performance the company considers the venezuela entity a variable interest entity for which the company is not the primary beneficiary the company has determined that the venezuela entity’s assets can only be used to settle its obligations as of december 31 2016  the company has no  outstanding exposures or commitments with respect to its venezuelan operations further dividends and payments for intercompany receivables due from the company’s venezuelan operations will be recorded as other income upon receipt

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 3679 million  in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2016  is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2016  the company had 800 million  in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2016  the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 

 46 

requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

customer programs 

the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers the cost of all of these various programs included as a reduction in net sales totaled 11443 million  6593 million  and 5942 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted the company’s reserve for uncollectible accounts was 233 million  and 146 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 330 million  233 million  and 242 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and are included in cost of products sold the company’s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and shrink reserves totaled 459 million  and 329 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

business combinations 

the company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology the period of time the company expects to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates in estimating the future cash flows the company considers demand competition and other economic factors the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible 

 47 

assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition 

the company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life in assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life the company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life customer loyalty brand strength and positioning the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors the company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets the company considers all other acquired intangible assets definitelived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straightline basis the company determines the amortizable life of acquired definitelived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset 

the company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results as a result the company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill 

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1 2016 as of the impairment testing date as a result of the jarden acquisition in april 2016 the company’s reporting units significantly increased to 25 reporting units comprising the company’s expanded nine operating segments acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are typically integrated into the companys existing reporting units however the 12 additional reporting units resulting from the jarden acquisition were not integrated into the company’s existing reporting units additionally the company recently announced changes to its management and division structure which will be executed in early 2017 and result in realigning the company’s reporting units and operating segments next year 

the company had 25 reporting units with total goodwill of 102 billion  of which approximately 83 billion  related to goodwill acquired in the jarden acquisition 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the companys reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired the company determined that no interim tests of impairment of goodwill were necessary during 2016 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the companys market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of 

 48 

the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 14 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company’s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting unit’s market position brand awareness gross and operating income margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the companys equity market value at july 1 2016 of approximately 235 billion  was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 113 billion  for the impairment test as of july 1 2016 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 05 from the 6 to 14 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to estimate the value of the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company also relies on a discounted cash flow approach when a reporting unit is recently acquired as of july 1 2016 and consistent with the aforementioned factors the company used the discounted cash flow approach for the annual impairment tests of its elmer’s and beverageware reporting units as well as the reporting units acquired in the jarden acquisition the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate longterm sales growth rate working capital reductions and working capital investments required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit 

in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the elmer’s reporting unit in 2016 the company used average compound shortterm and longterm sales growth rates of 3 and 2 respectively average operating margins generally ranging from 17 to 23 and a discount rate of 10 the company concluded the elmer’s reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the elmer’s reporting unit increased 50 basis points the elmer’s reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the beverageware reporting unit in 2016 the company used average compound shortterm and longterm sales growth rates of 6 and 3 respectively average operating margins generally ranging from 10 to 16 and a discount rate of 14 the company concluded the beverageware reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the beverageware reporting unit increased 50 basis points the beverageware reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the reporting units from the jarden acquisition in 2016 the company used discounted cash flow projections and related assumptions for sales growth operating margins and discount rate that were consistent with the acquisition model the company concluded the reporting units from the jarden acquisition passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing based on the estimated fair values determined using the discounted cash flow approach if the discount rates used to estimate the fair values of these reporting units were increased 50 basis points these reporting units would not have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test since the jarden acquisition took place in april 2016 and therefore fair values approximate carrying values 

for reporting units held for sale for which an offer has been received from a prospective buyer the company relies on the value offered by the third party for the sale of the reporting unit to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value in october 2016 the company entered into an agreement to sell the tools business excluding dymo industrial labeling for 195 billion  and such value was used as the estimated fair value of the construction tools  accessories and industrial products  services reporting units the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the construction tools  accessories and industrial products  services reporting units and the company concluded the construction tools  accessories and industrial products  services reporting units reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

apart from the reporting units related to the jarden acquisition described above the company has no reporting units with net assets whose estimated fair values at july 1 2016 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets 

 49 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test additionally the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset including factors such as declines in actual or planned sales or negative or declining cash flows input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors and other entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers based on the qualitative assessment if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 

for the quantitative impairment test the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2016 and determined that none of its significant indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired prior to the jarden acquisition there were 4758 million  of indefinitelived intangible assets and as part of the jarden acquisition the company acquired indefinitelived intangible assets with estimated fair values of 95 billion  although the purchase price is still preliminary the company does not expect these values to change significantly as they were derived from assumptions consistent with the acquisition model the company performed the quantitative impairment test for the 370 million  carrying value of the aprica trade name due to competitive pressures and other factors that have recently adversely impacted aprica sales in japan the company concluded the aprica trade name was not impaired however a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the aprica trade name of 104 million  and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of 49 million  in addition the company performed a quantitative impairment test for the 2000 million  carrying value of the elmer’s trade name due to the recent acquisition of the elmer’s business the company concluded the elmer’s trade name was not impaired however a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the elmer’s trade name of 164 million  and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of 180 million  the company also performed the quantitative impairment test for the 1020 million  carrying value of the baby jogger trade name due to the recent acquisition of the baby jogger business the company concluded the baby jogger trade name was not impaired a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not result in an impairment of the baby jogger trade name 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2016 was not required during 2016 

potential for future impairments 

the company had 25 reporting units with total goodwill of 102 billion  and 99 billion  of indefinitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2016  the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future additionally there are significant synergy savings projected for the company as a result of the jarden acquisition 

 50 

if these synergy savings are not realized or are realized by reporting units which differ significantly from the estimated projections it is reasonably likely that the company would be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 370 million  of internaluse software costs during 2016  which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in asia pacific capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2291 million  at december 31 2016  which excludes 446 million  of capitalized internaluse software classified as assets held for sale capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2016  

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 817 million  as of december 31 2016  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and other matters which are estimated 

 51 

at present value as of december 31 2016  the company had a reserve of 419 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors the pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of december 31 for 2016  and 2015  

the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the longterm return of pension and postretirement plan assets the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across 

 52 

geography and market capitalization through investments in us largecapitalization stocks us smallcapitalization stocks and international securities investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

the expected longterm rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations historical asset returns current and expected future market conditions risk and active management premiums the target asset allocations for the company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan based in part due to plan demographics funded status and liability duration in general the company’s target asset allocations for the domestic pension plans are as follows equities approximately 25  to 40  bonds approximately 20  to 40  and cash alternative investments and other approximately 25  to 45  actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons including market conditions and the timing of transactions the company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans the asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile at december 31 2016  the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows equities approximately 370  and other investments alternative investments fixedincome securities cash and other approximately 630  

for 2016  2015  and 2014  the actual return loss on plan assets for the company’s us pension plan assets was approximately 710 million  140 million  and 740 million  respectively versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately 690 million  580 million  and 580 million  respectively the actual amount of future contributions will depend in part on longterm actual return on assets and future discount rates pension contributions for all of the company’s pension plans for 2017 are estimated to be approximately 270 million  compared to approximately 280 million  in 2016  

the weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2016  was approximately 55  for the company’s pension plans the weighted average discount rate at the 2016  measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 35  a 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2016  measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately 710 million  

the healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers at the 2016  measurement date the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 87  the current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 45  a one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs 

see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans 

  restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation costs sublease income and other exit costs including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities the company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experience and previously negotiated settlements the company accrues for future lease costs net of management’s estimate for future sublease income when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable the total restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were 719 million  and 674 million  respectively due to the estimates required for future payments for employee separation programs vacated leased properties and contingencies actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in general business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices and that can affect the cost of operating investing and financing under those conditions the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks the company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10  change in these rates and prices 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt as such the company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs as of december 31 2016  approximately 12 billion  of the company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps the remainder of the debt approximately 107 billion  carries a fixed rate of interest based upon the company’s debt structure at december 31 2016  a hypothetical 1 increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately 118 million  and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately 7112 million  

 54 

while the company transacts business predominantly in us dollars and most of its revenues are collected in us dollars a substantial portion of the company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies such as the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro japanese yen and mexican peso changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses for 2016  approximately 28  of the company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies the most significant of which were european euroapproximately 90  and canadian dollarapproximately 54  the primary purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales a hypothetical 10  change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives 

the company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials as such the company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the company enters into commoditybased derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the company’s raw materials a hypothetical 10  change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the company’s results of operations in this sensitivity analysis all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the us dollar 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments all of which are highly rated institutions however the company does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties 

the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

customerscompetition

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive economic or other factors and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

 10 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a loss of or a failure by one of the company’s large customers could adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could adversely affect its sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades in 2013 two of the company’s large customers office depot and officemax completed their previously announced merger in february 2015 staples and office depot announced plans to merge the company currently expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain which could negatively impact the company’s sales and margins and adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation the company’s large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it could result in future pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building including advertising and promotion the company is currently in the process of implementing project renewal a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms project renewal may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated in addition such initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand leading brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

 11 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester corrugate steel gold brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the company’s financial results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted 

the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remain important factors in the company’s future growth in 2014 the company completed the acquisitions of ignite and baby jogger and the assets of bubba and in 2015 completed the acquisition of elmers products inc the company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated and manage unanticipated demands on the company’s management operational resources and financial and internal control systems furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital the company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring and integrating a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continually evaluates the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products in august 2015 the company sold its rubbermaid medical cart business and in november 2015 the company completed the sale of the endicia online postage business in october 2015 the company announced that it intends to divest its décor business which comprises its levolor ®  and kirsch ®  window coverings brands the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner in addition prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations are important to the company’s business and the company’s strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls price controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business compliance with us laws affecting operations outside the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing 

 12 

the company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the financial position and results of operations of many of the company’s international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the company’s financial statements the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the company’s reported sales operating margin and operating income and conversely the weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact for the year ended december 31 2015 foreign currency unfavorably affected reported sales by 331 million compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the volatility of foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the margin impacts from changes in foreign currency are because the company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely denominated in us dollars and the company’s international operations generally sell the company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies when local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar in the regions in which the company sells products whose costs are denominated in us dollars the company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products andor reduce costs through productivity or other initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability the company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics competition or otherwise and may not realize cost reductions through productivity or other initiatives as a result gross margins and overall operating results of the company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens 

the company has been adversely impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that have occurred in recent years the declining availability of us dollars and the implementation of pricing and exchange controls in venezuela in 2014 the venezuelan government issued a law on fair pricing which established a maximum profit margin of 30 thereby limiting the company’s ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in 2015 the venezuelan government adopted additional regulations requiring the company to identify the ultimate retail price to consumers on products it sells and further limit maximum profit margins on certain products to 20 both of which adversely affected the prices the company charges to its distributor customers and its distribution channels and routetomarket as a result of increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to us dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms the company concluded that an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar existed as of december 31 2015 the exchange restrictions and other regulations have impacted the company’s ability to make key operational and financial decisions regarding its venezuelan operations and benefit from the earnings of its venezuelan operations the company determined that it no longer could exercise control over the operations of its venezuela subsidiary accordingly the company deconsolidated its venezuela subsidiary on december 31 2015 and recorded a pretax charge of 1727 million 

future government actions such as currency devaluations import authorization controls foreign exchange controls price or profit controls or expropriation or other forms of government takeover could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations in particular the company’s baby  parenting business has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of baby  parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products in addition certain businesses in the company’s home solutions segment rely on a single source of supply for a majority of their products financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to manufacture and market its products which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 13 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for example the united states consumer product safety commission and health canada are advocating for more strict design standards for window blinds that if implemented would require the company to redesign a large number of window blinds products sold in the us and canada for certain products redesign may not be possible or practical and as a result the company would lose revenues from the sales of such products 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

 14 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s success at implementing project renewal and the growth game plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured deductible and may exceed the amount of insurance coverage while certain costs such as recall expenses and government fines are outside the scope of the companys insurance coverage 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively moody’s has a stable outlook on its ratings and standard  poor’s and fitch have a negative outlook on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade could increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

 15 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets expected health care costs or mortality rates the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

risks related to the proposed merger transactions with jarden corporation 

the company is subject to various risks related to the proposed merger transactions with jarden 

as described elsewhere is this annual report on form 10k the company has entered into the merger agreement with jarden pursuant to which the company will acquire jarden in the proposed merger transactions as defined below the risks contingencies and other uncertainties that could result in the failure of the proposed merger transactions to be completed or if completed that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the company following the proposed merger transactions and any anticipated benefits of the proposed merger transactions to the company include 

 

the future results of the company following the proposed merger transactions will suffer if newell brands does not effectively manage its expanded operations or successfully integrate the businesses of newell rubbermaid and jarden 

following the proposed merger transactions the size of the business of newell brands will increase significantly beyond the current size of either newell rubbermaid’s or jarden’s business newell brands’ future success will depend in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity if newell brands is not able to successfully combine the businesses of newell rubbermaid and jarden in an efficient and effective manner the anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of common stock of newell brands may be affected adversely an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the results of operations cash flows and financial position of newell brands which may adversely affect the value of its common stock following the proposed merger transactions in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual growth and cost savings if achieved may be lower than what newell brands expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated 

 16 

uncertainties associated with the proposed merger transactions may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could affect the future business and operations of the company following the proposed merger transactions 

the success of the proposed merger transactions will depend in part on newell brands’ ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by jarden and by the company it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with jarden or with the company as applicable while the proposed merger transactions are pending or with newell brands after the proposed merger transactions are consummated if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations newell brands’ business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the businesses to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause newell brands’ business to suffer in addition the company and jarden may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms 

newell rubbermaid may encounter difficulties or high costs associated with securing financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration 

newell rubbermaid currently intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration for the proposed merger transactions and related fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the proposed merger transactions to refinance approximately 45 billion of outstanding jarden debt and to assume two tranches of outstanding jarden debt with principal amounts of 300 million and €300 million with up to approximately 101 billion of new debt expected to be incurred in the form of 1 up to approximately 86 billion of newly issued newell rubbermaid debt securities and the 15 billion term loan facility depending on market conditions at the time of obtaining the financing and available cash balances and 2 available balance sheet cash to the extent necessary newell rubbermaid may also fund all or a portion of the cash portion of the merger consideration from borrowings under the bridge credit facility as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender or from borrowings under other permanent or alternative financing 

newell rubbermaid expects to pursue financing that would replace or supplement financing available under the bridge credit facility there is no guarantee that replacement or supplemental financing will be available to newell rubbermaid on acceptable terms or at all newell rubbermaid’s ability to obtain financing to replace or supplement the commitment under the bridge credit facility will be subject to various factors including market conditions operating performance and credit ratings and may be subject to restrictions in the agreements relating to newell rubbermaid’s outstanding debt 

the receipt of financing by newell rubbermaid is not a condition to the completion of the proposed merger transactions and except in certain limited circumstances in which newell rubbermaid or jarden may be permitted to terminate the proposed merger transactions if 1 the proceeds to be provided to newell rubbermaid pursuant to the bridge credit facility sufficient to consummate the proposed merger transactions are not available and 2 a debt rating failure has occurred newell rubbermaid will be required to complete the proposed merger transactions assuming that all of the conditions to its obligations under the merger agreement are satisfied newell rubbermaid would be obligated to complete the proposed merger transactions whether or not the bridge credit facility or other financing is available on acceptable terms or at all 

the substantial additional indebtedness that the company will incur in connection with the proposed merger transactions could materially adversely affect newell brands and its financial position after the proposed merger transactions including by decreasing newell brands’ business flexibility increasing its borrowing costs and resulting in a reduction of newell brands’ credit ratings  

following completion of the proposed merger transactions newell brands will have substantially increased debt compared to newell rubbermaid and jarden on a recent historical basis newell rubbermaid expects to incur more than 50 billion of additional debt excluding approximately 45 billion of jarden debt expected to be refinanced in connection with the proposed merger transactions and two tranches of outstanding jarden debt with principal amounts of 300 million and €300 million expected to be assumed by newell brands in connection with the proposed merger transactions assuming the conversion of all jarden’s convertible notes into shares of jarden common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration in connection with the completion of the proposed merger transactions this increased level of debt could have the effect among other things of reducing newell brands’ flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will have the effect of increasing newell brands’ interest expense in addition if newell brands is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness following the proposed merger transactions newell brands will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources which could increase its total debtto capitalization ratios decrease its interest coverage ratios or otherwise result in a breach of the covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of newell brands 

newell rubbermaid’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly newell rubbermaid’s cost of capital newell rubbermaid’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of newell rubbermaid’s financial strength operating performance and ability to meet newell rubbermaid’s debt obligations following announcement of the 

 17 

proposed merger transactions standard  poor’s ratings services reaffirmed all of its ratings on newell rubbermaid including its bbb corporate credit rating moody’s reaffirmed newell rubbermaid’s baa3 senior unsecured rating and fitch reaffirmed newell rubbermaid’s bbb longterm issuer default rating although fitch indicated it anticipates a downgrade from bbb to bbb upon completion of the proposed merger transactions there can be no assurance any of the rating agencies will not downgrade the company’s credit rating upon completion of the proposed merger transactions and any reduction in newell rubbermaid’s credit ratings either on a corporate basis or any one or more debt issuances or under the bridge credit facility as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender or otherwise may limit newell rubbermaid’s ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates currently available or available to newell rubbermaid prior to the proposed merger transactions any impairment of newell rubbermaid’s ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on newell rubbermaid’s ability to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration through the issuance of debt securities or another alternative to borrowings under the bridge credit facility on terms more favorable than those contemplated by the bridge credit facility or to refinance the bridge credit facility if drawn 

the proposed merger transactions are subject to a number of conditions to the obligations of both newell rubbermaid and jarden to complete the proposed merger transactions which if not fulfilled or not fulfilled in a timely manner may result in termination of the merger agreement 

the merger agreement contains a number of conditions to completion of the proposed merger transactions including among others 

 many of the conditions to completion of the proposed merger transactions are not within either newell rubbermaid’s or jarden’s control and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied if any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to july 31 2016 which may be extended by either newell rubbermaid or jarden up to two times each for an additional 45 day period it is possible that the merger agreement may be terminated although newell rubbermaid and jarden have agreed in the merger agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts subject to certain limitations to complete the proposed merger transactions as promptly as practicable these and other conditions to the completion of the proposed merger transactions may fail to be satisfied in addition satisfying the conditions to and completion of the proposed merger transactions may take longer and could cost more than newell rubbermaid and jarden expect neither newell rubbermaid nor jarden can predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the proposed merger transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring any delay in completing the proposed merger transactions may adversely affect the cost savings and other benefits that newell rubbermaid expects to achieve if the proposed merger transactions and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe 

failure to complete the proposed merger transactions could negatively impact newell rubbermaid’s or jarden’s stock price and have a material adverse effect on their results of operations cash flows and financial position 

if the proposed merger transactions are not completed for any reason including as a result of newell rubbermaid or jarden stockholders failing to approve the applicable proposals the ongoing businesses of newell rubbermaid and jarden may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the proposed merger transactions newell rubbermaid and jarden would be subject to a number of risks including the following 

  18 

 for example the merger agreement provides that upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances including termination by newell rubbermaid or jarden to enter into a definitive agreement for a proposal that constitutes a superior proposal newell rubbermaid or jarden as applicable will be required to pay the other a cash termination fee equal to 385 million in addition if the merger agreement is terminated by either party due to a failure to obtain the applicable necessary stockholder approval newell rubbermaid or jarden as applicable will be required to reimburse the other for up to 100 million for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger transactions newell rubbermaid could also be required to pay a termination fee of 900 million to jarden and terminate the merger agreement under certain conditions if it is unable to obtain financing contemplated by the merger agreement including the bridge credit facility as contemplated by the commitment letter with a lender and is otherwise unable to secure alternative investment grade financing 

if the proposed merger transactions are not completed the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows financial position and stock prices

foreign currency  venezuela 

the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes “bolivars” into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings the company’s venezuelan operations are primarily included in the writing segment the company generally imports raw materials into venezuela and manufactures writing instruments locally the company’s venezuelan operations also import components and finished goods generally purchases of imported products are denominated in us dollars the company has historically used various means including price increases and productivity initiatives to offset increased costs due to the impacts of high inflation and currency devaluations during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the company’s venezuelan operations generated 22 14 and 14 of consolidated net sales respectively and approximately 51 million 30 million and 34 million of the company’s reported operating income respectively the venezuelan operations also generated approximately 40 million of cash flow from operating activities during 2015 

beginning in july 2013 the venezuelan government authorized certain companies that operate in designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of bolivars for us dollars at a bid rate established via weekly auctions under a system referred to as “sicad i” during the first quarter of 2014 the government expanded the types of transactions that may be subject to the weekly sicad i auction rate while retaining the official rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar and introduced another currency exchange mechanism “sicad ii” the official exchange rate for settling certain transactions through the national center of foreign trade “cencoex” including imports of essential goods remained at 63 bolivars per us dollar in march 2014 the company analyzed the multiple rates available and the company’s estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled and dividends could be paid based on this analysis the company determined as of march 31 2014 that the sicad i rate was the most appropriate rate to use prospectively for remeasurement rather than the cencoex rate which the company used up to march 31 2014 as a result the company recorded net foreign exchange losses of 456 million in 2014 including 387 million of foreign exchange losses during the three months ended march 31 2014 based on the adoption of and ongoing changes in the sicad i exchange rate applicable for remeasuring the net monetary assets of the company’s venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivars as of december 31 2014 the sicad i auction rate was 120 bolivars per us dollar and the sicad ii rate was 500 bolivars per us dollar 

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes in its foreign currency exchange system the official rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar continued to be made available for purchases of essential goods the sicad i exchange mechanism became known as sicad there were sicad auctions conducted during 2014 and 2015 and the exchange rate in the last sicad auction in 2015 was 135 bolivars per us dollar the sicad ii market has been eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system “simadi” has been created the simadi market is intended to have a floating exchange rate determined by market participants simadi became operational with an initial exchange rate of approximately 170 bolivars per us dollar the simadi rate has since increased to 1987 bolivars per us dollar as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015 it is unclear how future sicad auctions will work and the volume of transactions in the simadi market since its inception has been limited the company last participated in a sicad auction in the fourth quarter of 2014 

 33 

during 2014 the company was awarded 75 million and 160 million via the cencoex and sicad i exchange mechanisms respectively and during 2015 the company was awarded 16 million via the cencoex exchange mechanism the company’s venezuelan operations used these amounts to pay third party and intercompany vendors the company did not participate in the sicad ii market in 2014 or 2015 and did not participate in the simadi market in 2015 

based on an assessment of the rate at which future transactions could be settled and dividends could legally be paid by the company’s venezuelan operations the company used the sicad rate during the year ended december 31 2015 which was a rate of 135 bolivars per us dollar as of december 31 2015 as a result of declines in the sicad rate from 120 bolivars per us dollar at december 31 2014 to 135 bolivars per us dollar as of december 31 2015 the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 92 million during the year ended december 31 2015 based on the change in the sicad rate used for remeasuring the net monetary assets of the company’s venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivars 

as part of the changes implemented in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government also issued a law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 for the types of products the company sells in venezuela in addition new regulations implemented in 2015 require the company to identify the ultimate retail price to consumers on products it sells to distributors in venezuela in october 2015 the venezuelan government reduced the maximum profit margin from 30 to 20 for the types of goods the company imports into the country for sale for locally manufactured goods the company sells the maximum profit margin remains at 30 

as of december 31 2015 the company determined it could no longer exercise control over its venezuela operations because the availability of us dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms the company most recently participated in a sicad auction in the fourth quarter of 2014 and had very little access to the cencoex exchange mechanism during 2015 as the conditions in venezuela have continued to deteriorate including increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to us dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms the company concluded that an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the bolivar and the us dollar existed as of december 31 2015 furthermore increasingly restrictive governmental regulations related to prices the company can charge for its products distribution channels into which the company can sell its products product labeling requirements importation of raw materials and sourced products which must be purchased in us dollars and labor matters have restricted the company’s ability to make and execute decisions related to its venezuelan operations additionally the exchange restrictions have prevented the venezuela business from paying royalties and dividends restricting the ability of the company to benefit from the earnings of its venezuela operations these factors impact the company’s ability to make key operational and financial decisions regarding its venezuelan operations such as the company’s ability to manage its venezuelan operations’ capital structure material sourcing product pricing and labor relations as a result the company deconsolidated its venezuelan operations effective december 31 2015 and began accounting for its investment in its venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting as a result of deconsolidating its venezuelan operations the company recorded a pretax charge of 1727 million in 2015 the charge consisted of the writeoff of the venezuelan operations’ net assets of 747 million as well as 583 million of venezuelarelated assets held by other subsidiaries resulting in 1330 million of total charges associated with the deconsolidation of venezuela’s net assets in addition in accordance with applicable accounting standards for foreign currency and the transition to the cost method for the company’s venezuelan operations the company wroteoff the currency translation adjustment that arose prior to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 that was included in other comprehensive income in equity the writeoff of the currency translation adjustment resulted in a pretax charge of 397 million which had no effect on net assets or total equity 

beginning in the first quarter of 2016 the company will no longer include the results of its venezuelan operations in its consolidated financial statements the company has operated in venezuela for decades and plans to continue to manufacture and sell products in venezuela the company will record revenues for sales of inventory to its venezuelan operations in its consolidated financial statements to the extent the sales are realizable further dividends and payments for intercompany receivables due from the company’s venezuelan operations will be recorded as other income upon receipt prior to the deconsolidation of the venezuelan operations on december 31 2015 the results of the company’s venezuelan operations have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and have been included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets for all periods prior to december 31 2015

consolidated results of operations 

the company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of operations are important in evaluating the company’s operations the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31  in millions except percentages

core sales in the company’s north american and international businesses increased 38 and 100 respectively latin america led with core sales growth of 305 as a result of pricing and volume in the region including venezuela improved backtoschool performance volume gains in the win bigger businesses and increased advertising and promotion north america generated core growth of 38 as core sales grew across all five segments with strong core sales growth in the writing commercial products and baby  parenting segments emea core sales increased 15 due to growth in the writing commercial products and tools segments which was offset by a decline in baby  parenting due to challenging market conditions in russia and weakness in the baby  parenting segment across emea the writing segment’s growth in emea was due to distribution gains merchandising and promotion support pricing and strengthened innovation asia pacific core sales increased 34 as doubledigit innovationled core growth in baby  parenting and doubledigit core growth in commercial products more than offset a slight decline in writing overall core sales growth in venezuela contributed 160 basis points to the company’s 55 core sales growth in 2015 the company’s core sales growth in 2015 was favorably impacted by additional sellin in advance of advertising and marketing support planned for 2016 

 35

cash conversion cycle 

the company defines its cash conversion cycle as the sum of inventory and accounts receivable days outstanding based on cost of products sold and net sales respectively for the most recent threemonth period including discontinued operations minus accounts payable days outstanding based on cost of products sold for the most recent threemonth period including discontinued operations at the end of the year the following table depicts the company’s cash conversion cycle at december 31  in number of days  



the increase in the cash conversion cycle from 2015 to 2014 is primarily due to the increase in inventory days driven by higher inventory balances at december 31 2015 as compared to december 31 2014 largely attributable to inventory builds for new product launches the decrease in the cash conversion cycle from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to the increase in accounts payable days as a result of increased purchases towards the end of 2014 as compared to 2013 partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable days attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 the increase in accounts payable days in 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013 is attributable to the timing and management of purchases and payments 

the acquisition of elmer’s and divestiture of endicia had the effect of increasing the cash conversion cycle by approximately 1 day in 2015 due to the timing of the transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015 the bubba and baby jogger acquisitions in 2014 had the effect of increasing the cash conversion cycle by approximately 1 day in 2014 compared to 2013 since the bubba and baby jogger results of operations were not included in the company’s results of operations for the entire fourth quarter of 2014 the company’s cash conversion cycle is impacted by the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters based on historical trends due to inventory buildups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers

in addition to the committed portion of the facility the revolving credit agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders in the lenders’ discretion of up to 5000 million which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the facility 

as extended in august 2015 the company’s receivables facility provides for available borrowings up to 4000 million and expires in august 2016 as of december 31 2015  aggregate borrowings of 3500 million  were outstanding under the receivables facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 11  

the following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the company’s shortterm borrowing arrangements during the years ended december 31  in millions  



in october 2015 the company entered into the elmer’s bridge facility which provided for maximum borrowings of 4000 million and was to be used to finance the purchase price of elmer’s the elmer’s bridge facility was terminated upon the company’s issuance of the 2018 notes and 2025 notes in october 2015 the company incurred 25 million of debt issuance costs in october 2015 in connection with entering into the elmer’s bridge facility and the amortization of the 25 million of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 

in connection with the proposed merger transactions the company entered into a commitment letter pursuant to which the lender committed to provide the jarden bridge facility the availability under the jarden bridge facility is subject to reduction in equivalent amounts upon the completion of any issuance of debt securities by the company and upon other specified events as provided in the commitment letter the availability under the commitment letter and jarden bridge facility was reduced to 90 billion in january 2016 upon the company entering into the term loan credit agreement as further described below the company expects to replace all or a portion of the jarden bridge facility with permanent financing prior to closing the acquisition if entered into borrowings under the jarden bridge facility would bear interest at the company’s election at i the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or ii the base rate plus an applicable margin the obligation of the lender to provide this debt financing is subject to a number of customary conditions including execution and delivery of certain definitive documentation the company incurred 477 million of debt issuance costs in december 2015 in connection with entering into the commitment letter which are included in prepaid expenses and other at december 31 2015 

in january 2016 the company entered into a credit agreement the “term loan credit agreement” for the 15 billion senior unsecured term loan facility with a syndicate of banks the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan credit agreement will be used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with the proposed merger transactions and pay some or all of the related fees and expenses borrowings under the term loan credit agreement will be funded upon the satisfaction of certain conditions including the consummation of the jarden transaction but in no event prior to march 31 2016 the term loan 

 47 

credit agreement provides for a maturity date of three years from the closing date of the jarden transaction and requires the company to repay 5 of the initial borrowings in each of the first and second years after the closing of the jarden transaction and the remaining 90 of the initial borrowings during the third year after the closing of the jarden transaction at the company’s election borrowings under the term loan credit agreement will bear interest either at i the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or ii the base rate plus an applicable margin the term loan credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties covenants and events of default the covenants set forth in the term loan credit agreement include certain affirmative and negative operational and financial covenants including among other things a requirement that the company maintain certain interest coverage and total indebtedness to total capital ratios as defined in the term loan credit agreement in addition the term loan credit agreement provides for certain events of default the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of the company’s obligations under the term loan credit agreement 

the indentures governing the company’s mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants the company’s borrowing arrangements other than the mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum debttototalcapitalization ratios as defined by the agreements governing these other borrowing arrangements minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods generally maximum debttototalcapitalization is calculated as the sum of shortterm and longterm debt divided by the sum of i total debt ii total stockholders’ equity iii 7500 million related to impairment charges incurred by the company amended under the revolving credit agreement to add an additional 2500 million of charges incurred after january 1 2015 and iv up to 6000 million related to the component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for all foreign currency translation and the cumulative foreign exchange gains losses incurred since january 1 2012 arising from i the appreciation or depreciation of the venezuelan bolivar relative to the us dollar due to the highly inflationary accounting for venezuela and ii the cumulative gains or losses resulting from the deconsolidation of a foreign entity amended under the revolving credit agreement to up to 10 billion of similar items as defined in the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2015 the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the facility and receivables facility and utilize the 8500 million of availability at december 31 2015 to fund operating activities working capital requirements capital expenditures andor acquisitions without exceeding the debttototalcapitalization limit in its financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the facility and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

interest rate hedging activities 

the company uses derivatives to hedge interest rates on anticipated issuances of mediumterm notes occurring within one year or less of the inception date of the derivative and the company uses these instruments to reduce the volatility in future interest payments that would be made pursuant to the anticipated issuances of mediumterm notes these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges the changes in fair values of these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income loss and after the mediumterm notes are issued and the derivative instruments are settled the amount in other comprehensive income loss is amortized to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the related mediumterm notes the cash paid or received from the settlement of forwardstarting interest rate swaps is included in cash flows from operating activities 

during december 2015 and january 2016 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of 10 billion and 13 billion respectively to hedge the benchmark interest rate underlying anticipated interest payments on mediumterm notes the company expects to issue to finance the jarden transaction the “swaps” the swaps are designated as hedges of expected interest payments for periods ranging from 5 to 30 years the company’s net position with respect to the swaps fluctuates based on changes in benchmark interest rates and declines in the benchmark interest rates after the date the company enters into the swaps generally results in amounts the company is required to pay the counterparties to settle such swaps if benchmark interest rates do not increase from their current levels the company would be required to pay the counterparties for the value of the swaps since benchmark interest rates have declined since the company entered into the swaps and such amounts could be significant the company classifies cash inflows and outflows associated with forwardstarting interest rate swaps in cash flows from operating activities 

debt 

the company has varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business the volume and timing of production impacts the company’s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through shortterm financing arrangements such as commercial paper or borrowings under the facility or receivables facility 

 48 

total debt was 31 billion  and 25 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively an increase of 5945 million which is primarily attributable to the october 2015 issuance of the 2018 notes and 2025 notes the proceeds from the 2018 notes and 2025 notes were used to finance the elmer’s acquisition 

as of december 31 2015  the current portion of longterm debt and shortterm debt totaled 3888 million  including 3500 million  of borrowings under the receivables facility 

 the following table presents the average outstanding debt and weightedaverage interest rates for the years ended december 31  in millions except percentages

see footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

pension and other postretirement plan obligations 

the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets as well as prevailing market rates of interest as a result future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates the actual return on plan assets and various estimates regarding the timing and amount of future benefit payments for example the company’s 16 billion of projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit plans as of december 31 2015 would increase approximately 535 million due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate in 2015 the projected benefit obligations of the company’s primary us defined benefit plan decreased 300 million due to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate and and decreased 176 million due to using updated mortality assumptions in 2014 the projected benefit obligations of the company’s us defined benefit plans increased 773 million due to a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate and and increased 1119 million due to using updated mortality assumptions 

the company made voluntary cash contributions of 700 million and 1000 million to its primary us defined benefit pension plan during 2015 and 2013 respectively to improve the overall funded status of the plan and offset the impacts of the adoption of new mortality tables to measure us plan liabilities the significant contributions the company made in 2015 and 2013 were not material to the company’s pretax income for 2015 and 2013 considering the expected return on plan assets of 725 and 75 for 2015 and 2013 respectively and the company’s average borrowing rate of 28 and 30 respectively 

in september 2014 the company commenced an offer to approximately 5700 former employees who have deferred vested benefits under the company’s taxqualified us pension plan and in september 2015 the company initiated a similar offer to 3300 former employees these former employees had the opportunity to make a onetime election to receive a lumpsum distribution of the present value of their benefits by the end of 2014 or 2015 as applicable the benefit obligations associated with the 2014 and 2015 offers were approximately 200 million and 120 million respectively cash payments of 986 million and 706 million were made from the pension plan assets in december 2014 and december 2015 respectively to those electing the lumpsum distribution the lump sum payment offers did not impact the company’s cash flow based on the lumpsum distributions that were paid the company incurred noncash settlement charges of 654 million and 521 million in 2014 and 2015 respectively 

the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate

resolution of income tax contingencies 

the company recorded 190 million 155 million and 79 million in net income tax benefits in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2015 2014 and 2013 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different from that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2015  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 1629 million  in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2015  is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2015  the company had liabilities net of plan assets of 3719 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

customer programs 

the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers the cost of all of these various programs included as a reduction in net sales totaled 6593 million  5942 million  and 5278 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the company had accrued 2949 million and 2883 million respectively for customer programs and such amounts are included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables 

 52 

could be further adjusted the company’s reserve for uncollectible accounts was 146 million and 160 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 233 million 242 million and 196 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively and are included in cost of products sold the company’s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and shrink reserves totaled 329 million and 326 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

business combinations 

the company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology the period of time the company expects to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates in estimating the future cash flows the company considers demand competition and other economic factors the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition 

the company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life in assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life the company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life customer loyalty brand strength and positioning the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors the company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets the company considers all other acquired intangible assets definitelived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straightline basis the company determines the amortizable life of acquired definitelived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset 

the company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results as a result the company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1 2015 for the 14 reporting units that comprise the company’s five operating segments acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are typically integrated into the companys existing reporting units goodwill of 1746 million associated with the acquisitions of ignite and the assets of bubba in the second half of 2014 are included in the beverageware reporting unit and goodwill of 853 million associated with the acquisition of baby jogger in the fourth quarter of 2014 has been included in the baby  parenting reporting unit 

as of july 1 2015 the company had 14 reporting units with total goodwill of 25 billion five of the company’s 14 reporting units accounted for over 72 of the company’s total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression dymo office industrial products  services commercial products and baby  parenting essentials

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the companys reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired the company determined that the operating results of the company’s construction tools  accessories reporting unit in the back half of 2015 was an interim impairment indicator primarily resulting from economic conditions in brazil and evaluated construction tools  accessories’ goodwill to assess whether it was impaired other than the interim impairment evaluation of construction tools  accessories’ goodwill at december 31 2015 no interim tests of impairment of goodwill were necessary during 2015 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year andor succeeding year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the companys market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 15 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company’s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting unit’s market position brand awareness gross and operating income margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the companys equity market value at july 1 2015 of approximately 111 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 18 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2015 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 05 from the 6 to 15 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company also relies on a discounted cash flow approach when a reporting unit is recently acquired as of july 1 2015 the company used the discounted cash flow approach for the annual impairment test of its beverageware reporting unit the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate longterm sales growth rate working capital reductions and working capital investments required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the beverageware reporting unit in 2015 the company used average compound shortterm and longterm sales growth rates of 8 and 3 respectively average operating margins generally ranging from 10 to 14 and a discount rate of 14 the company concluded the beverageware reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the beverageware reporting unit increased 50 basis points the beverageware reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

 54 

for reporting units held for sale for which an offer has been received from a prospective buyer the company relies on the value offered by the third party for the sale of the reporting unit to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value in march 2015 the company entered into an agreement to sell the endicia business for 215 million and such value was used as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the endicia reporting unit and the company concluded the endicia reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

the company has no reporting units with net assets whose estimated fair values at july 1 2015 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets with the exception of the construction tools  accessories reporting unit the estimated fair value of the construction tools  accessories reporting unit using the ebitda multiple approach exceeded its net assets by 7 as the construction tools  accessories reporting unit’s ebitda has been adversely impacted by transactional foreign currency in 2015 as of december 31 2015 the company evaluated the construction tools  accessories’ goodwill for impairment based on the reporting unit’s operating performance in the back half of 2015 particularly in latin america based on actions taken in late 2015 to reduce costs and initiatives and projects planned for 2016 to further improve construction tools  accessories’ operating results which include reductions in advertising and promotion and overhead costs and projects to reduce the increasingly adverse impacts of transactional foreign currency the company concluded construction tools  accessories’ goodwill was not impaired as of december 31 2015 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

the companys indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 4758 million as of july 1 2015 the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test additionally the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset including factors such as declines in actual or planned sales or negative or declining cash flows input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors and other entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers based on the qualitative assessment if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 

for the quantitative impairment test the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2015 and determined that none of its significant indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired the company performed the quantitative impairment test for the 370 million carrying value of the aprica trade name due to competitive pressures and other factors that have recently adversely impacted aprica sales in japan the company concluded the aprica trade name was not impaired however a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the aprica trade name of 78 million and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of 16 million the company also performed the quantitative impairment test for the 1120 million carrying value of the baby jogger trade name due to the recent acquisition of the baby jogger business the company concluded the baby jogger trade name was not impaired however a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the baby jogger trade name of 87 million and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of 102 million 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2015 was not required during 2015 

potential for future impairments 

the company had 14 reporting units with total goodwill of 28 billion as of december 31 2015 six of the company’s 14 reporting units accounted for approximately 78 of the company’s total goodwill these six reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression elmer’s dymo office industrial products  services commercial products and baby  parenting essentials the company also had 6534 million of indefinitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2015 the company 

 55 

cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 389 million of internaluse software costs during 2015  which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in asia pacific capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2129 million  at december 31 2015  which excludes 149 million of capitalized internaluse software classified as assets held for sale capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2015 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s forecasts if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 412 million  as of december 31 2015  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 56 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2015  ranged between 229 million  and 288 million  as of december 31 2015  the company had a reserve of 235 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used 

the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  in millions  



the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  



the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 36 to determine the expenses for 2015 for the pension and postretirement plans the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 58 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2015 

 58 

effective december 31 2015 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans this new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligations historically the estimated service and interest cost components utilized a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period 

the company elected this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly will be accounted for prospectively while the benefit obligations for the plans measured under this approach are unchanged the more granular application of the spot rates will reduce the 2016 service and interest cost by 95 million 

the company reduced its estimated return on asset assumption for its primary us pension plan from 725 in 2015 to 625 in 2016 which the company estimates will result in a 68 million increase in pension expense in 2016 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2015 were  155  billion and 679 million  respectively the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 39 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2015 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



  

the company has 4223 million  aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses  6196 million  pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2015 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is generally amortized to expense over the remaining life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled  218 million  pretax in 2015 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future in addition the company recognized 521 million of previously unrecognized pension losses as a settlement charge in 2015 in connection with the payment of lumpsum benefits to certain us pension plan participants changes in actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation costs sublease income and other exit costs including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities the company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experience and previously negotiated settlements the company accrues for future lease costs net of management’s estimate for future sublease income when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used when estimating the costs of exiting facilities 

 59 

estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable the total restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were 674 million and 462 million respectively due to the estimates required for future payments for employee separation programs vacated leased properties and contingencies actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates

international operations   

for 2015  2014  and 2013  the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 27  31  and 33  of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentages  



the company previously accounted for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings the company deconsolidated its venezuelan operations effective december 31 2015 and began accounting for its investment in its venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting sales of the company’s venezuela operations are included in the nonus amounts in the table above for all periods presented 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s venezuelan operations 

income taxes 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

fair value measurements   

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present 

 60 

value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund and other investments included in other assets derivative instruments primarily included in prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and pension assets and liabilities included in the company’s net pension liability and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund and other investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts forwardstarting interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard pricing models and marketbased assumptions for all significant inputs such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates accordingly the company’s derivative instruments are classified as level 2 the company determines the fair value of its pension assets annually primarily based on quoted market prices level 1 and the fair value of underlying investments and marketbased inputs level 2 the fair values of approximately 2 of the company’s pension assets at december 31 2015 are determined using level 3 inputs 

forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such forwardlooking statements may relate to but are not limited to information or assumptions about the effects of sales including pricing incomeloss earnings per share return on equity return on invested capital operating income operating margin or gross margin improvements or declines project renewal capital and other expenditures working capital cash flow dividends capital structure debt to capitalization ratios debt ratings availability of financing interest rates restructuring and other project costs impairment and other charges potential losses on divestitures impacts of changes in accounting standards pending legal proceedings and claims including environmental matters future economic performance costs and cost savings inflation or deflation with respect to raw materials and sourced products productivity and streamlining synergies changes in foreign exchange rates product recalls expected benefits and synergies and financial results from recently completed acquisitions and planned acquisitions and divestitures and management’s plans goals and objectives for future operations performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forwardlooking statements these statements generally are accompanied by words such as “intend” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “project” “target” “plan” “expect” “will” “should” “would” or similar statements the company cautions that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the company’s dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in light of the continuation or escalation of the global economic slowdown or regional sovereign debt issues currency fluctuations competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products major retailers’ strong bargaining power and consolidation of the company’s customers changes in the prices of raw materials and sourced products and the company’s ability to obtain raw materials and sourced products in a timely manner from suppliers the company’s ability to develop innovative new products and to develop maintain and strengthen its enduser brands including the ability to realize anticipated benefits of increased increased advertising and promotion spend product liability product recalls or regulatory actions the company’s ability to expeditiously close facilities and move operations while managing foreign regulations and other impediments a failure of one of the company’s key information technology systems or related controls the potential inability to attract retain and motivate key employees future events that could adversely affect the value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges the company’s ability to improve productivity and streamline operations changes to the company’s credit ratings significant increases in the funding obligations related to the company’s pension plans due to declining asset values declining interest rates or otherwise

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 683 of the company’s 308 billion  of total debt as of december 31 2015 

interest rate risk is also present on anticipated issuances of debt the company manages its interest rate exposure on anticipated issuances of debt through forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in future interest payments that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates prior to the issuance of the debt accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the interest cash flows of the company’s anticipated debt issuances which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2015 the company had entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements for 10 billion notional amount of debt anticipated to be issued in the first half of 2016 and in january 2016 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements for an additional 13 billion notional amount of debt anticipated to be issued in the first half of 2016 such forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were designated as hedges of the cash flows associated with benchmark interest rates underlying future interest payments on the anticipated debt issuances if benchmark interest rates do not increase from current levels the company would be required to pay the counterparties for the value of the forwardstarting interest rate swaps since benchmark interest rates have declined since the company entered into the forwardstarting interest rate swaps and such amounts could be significant

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of durations of 18 months or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency particularly in situations where financial instruments are not available for currencies to hedge exposures 

 62 

the company also realizes gains and losses recorded within stockholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans to or from foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps forward starting interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 as follows in millions  



see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding cost and equity method investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the oneday valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

  



  

 the increase in value at risk associated with interest rates and foreign exchange is primarily due to increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery producing and procuring products at a competitive cost and experienced management in addition the company focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers’ needs

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging global economic conditions particularly outside the us there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions including the deterioration in the creditworthiness of or a default by the issuers of sovereign debt such events could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

 9 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a loss of or a failure by one of the company’s large customers would adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s customers may further consolidate which could adversely affect its sales and margins 

the company’s customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades in 2013 two of the company’s large customers office depot and officemax completed their previously announced merger in february 2015 staples and office depot announced plans to merge the company currently expects the combined companies will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain which will negatively impact the company’s sales and margins and adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations there can be no assurance that following consolidation these and other large customers will continue to buy from the company across different product categories or geographic regions or at the same levels as prior to consolidation which could negatively impact the company’s financial results further if the consolidation trend continues it is likely to result in future pressures that could reduce the company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building the company is currently in the process of implementing project renewal a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms and align the business around two key activities — brand  category development and market execution  delivery project renewal may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated in addition such initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the considerable costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

 10 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising spend its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester corrugate steel gold brass carbide and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the company’s financial results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted 

the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remains an important factor in the company’s future growth in 2014 the company completed the acquisitions of ignite and baby jogger and the assets of bubba the company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated and manage unanticipated demands on the company’s management operational resources and financial and internal control systems furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital the company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products during 2014 the company’s endicia and culinary electrics and retail businesses were classified as discontinued operations based on the company’s commitment to sell these businesses and the company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner in addition prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations are important to the company’s business and the company’s strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business compliance with us laws affecting operations outside the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing 

the company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the financial position and results of operations of many of the company’s international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the company’s financial statements the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the company’s reported sales and operating margin and conversely the weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact for the year ended december 31 2014 foreign currency unfavorably affected reported sales by 1153 million compared to the year ended december 31 2013 the volatility of foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the margin impacts from changes in foreign currency are because the company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely denominated in us dollars and the company’s international operations generally sell the company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies when local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar in the regions in which the company sells products whose costs are denominated in us dollars the company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products andor reduce costs through productivity or other initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability the company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics competition or otherwise and may not realize cost reductions through productivity or other initiatives as a result gross margins and overall operating results of the company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens 

the company has been and will continue to be impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that have occurred in recent years as well as the implementation of related exchange controls in addition in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government issued a law on fair pricing which establishes a maximum profit margin of 30 thereby limiting the company’s ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluation in 2015 regulations will require the company to identify the ultimate retail price to consumers on products it sells which could adversely affect the prices the company charges to its distributor customers going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations continued import authorization controls foreign exchange price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government takeover could have further adverse impacts on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations in particular the company’s baby  parenting business has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of baby  parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to manufacture and market its products which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 12 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for example the united states consumer product safety commission and health canada are advocating for more strict design standards for window blinds that if implemented would require the company to redesign all window blinds sold in the us and canada for certain products redesign may not be possible or practical and as a result the company would lose revenues from the sales of such products 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

 13 

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s success at implementing project renewal and the growth game plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses for example in 2014 the company initiated a voluntary recall on harness buckles used on certain gracobranded convertible and harnessed booster toddler car seats which was later expanded to include harness buckles used on certain infant car seats manufactured between july 2010 and may 2013 the company’s results for the year ended december 31 2014 included 150 million of charges reflecting the cost of the recall of the harness buckles used on certain toddler and infant car seats which does not include any fines or penalties that may result from the investigation into the circumstances related to the recall announced by the national highway traffic safety administration in december 2014 although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively moodys has a stable outlook on its ratings and fitch and standard  poor’s have positive outlooks on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade could increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the 

 14 

equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

foreign currency  venezuela 

the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes “bolivars” into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings the company’s venezuelan operations are primarily included in the company’s writing segment the company generally imports raw materials into venezuela and manufactures writing instruments locally the company’s venezuelan operations also import components and finished goods generally purchases of imported products are denominated in us dollars the company has historically used various means including price increases and productivity initiatives to offset increased costs due to the impacts of high inflation and currency devaluations during 2014 2013 and 2012 the company’s venezuelan operations generated 14 or less of consolidated net sales and 54 or less of operating income 

in 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme was allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivars to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivars to us dollar since the introduction of sitme in june 2010 the venezuelan government held the rate constant at 53 bolivars to us dollar until february 2013 in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar resulting in the exchange rate declining from 53  to 63  bolivars to us dollar the company recorded an 111 million foreign exchange loss in 2013 as a result of the rate declining from 53 to 63 bolivars to us dollar 

beginning in july 2013 the venezuelan government authorized certain companies that operate in designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of bolivars for us dollars at a bid rate established via weekly auctions under a system referred to as “sicad i” during the first quarter of 2014 the government expanded the types of transactions that may be subject to the weekly sicad i auction rate while retaining the official rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar and introduced another currency exchange mechanism “sicad ii” the official exchange rate for settling certain transactions through the national center of foreign trade “cencoex” including imports of essential goods remains at 63 bolivars per us dollar as of december 31 2014 the sicad i auction rate was 120 bolivars per us dollar and the sicad ii rate was 500 bolivars per us dollar the company continues to believe that transactions for imports of essential goods such as certain raw materials and finished goods primarily in the writing segment may be settled at the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar and the company has continued to receive authorizations to import product and to receive cash for vendor payments at this rate during 2014 the company was awarded 75 million and 160 million via the cencoex and sicad i exchange mechanisms respectively which were or will be used by the venezuela business to pay third party and intercompany vendors the company did not receive any us dollars via sicad ii in 2014 

in march 2014 the company analyzed the multiple rates currently available and the company’s estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled and dividends can be paid based on this analysis the company determined as of march 31 2014 that the sicad i rate was the most appropriate rate to use prospectively for remeasurement rather than the cencoex rate which the company used up to march 31 2014 as a result the company recorded net charges of 456 million  in 2014 based on changes in the exchange rate applicable for remeasuring the net monetary assets of the company’s venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivars in addition the company’s 2014 reported net sales and operating income were adversely impacted by 42 million and 24 million respectively due solely to the use of the sicad i rate for 2014 rather than the cencoex rate which includes the adverse impact on gross margins attributable to higher costs of inventory due to the use of the sicad i rate and the increased costs of importing raw materials and finished goods 

the results of the company’s venezuelan operations have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented as the company has been able to exchange bolivars for a sufficient amount of us dollars to fund its venezuelan operations’ us dollar purchases and has had the ability to exercise control over a majority of the operating decisions of its venezuelan business 

as of december 31 2014  the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had approximately 558 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the rate of 120 bolivars per us dollar and as a result a 10 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would result in an estimated pretax charge benefit of approximately 6 million  on an ongoing basis excluding the impacts of any actions management might otherwise take in response to a change in exchange rates such as raising or decreasing prices a 10 increase decrease in the exchange rate would unfavorably favorably impact annual net sales and operating income by an estimated 8 million  and 6 million  respectively although the sicad ii rate was no longer quoted beginning in february 

 27 

2015 were the company to have adopted the sicad ii rate for remeasurement as of december 31 2014 the company would have been required to record a pretax charge of 424 million associated with the decline in value of the net monetary assets of the company’s venezuelan operations denominated in bolivars in addition annual sales would have been adversely affected by 599 million compared to the use of the sicad i rate and the company would generate operating losses in venezuela absent any price increases or other actions the company may implement 

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes in its foreign currency exchange system the preferential rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar is expected to continue to be made available for purchases of essential goods and the existing sicad i rate remains at 120 bolivars per us dollar as of february 2015 the sicad ii market has been eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system “simadi” has been createdthe simadi market is intended to have a floating exchange rate determined by market participants simadi became operational with an initial exchange rate of approximately 170 bolivars per us dollar while the company will continue to assess the impact if any of the changes to the venezuela foreign currency exchange system if the company is unable to obtain sufficient us dollars from cencoex or the sicad i markets to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the simadi market it would significantly impact the company’s venezuelan operations which would adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

as part of the changes implemented in the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 in addition new regulations will require the company to identify the ultimate retail price to consumers on products it sells to distributors in venezuela in 2015 which could adversely affect the prices the company charges its distributor customers laws and regulations limit the company’s ability to implement future price increases could result in the reduction of prices with respect to certain products categories and result in fines for practices deemed to be in violation of the laws and regulations the impacts of any future pricing regulations are not included in the estimated ongoing impacts outlined above price controls generally may affect products the company markets and sells in venezuela 

the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela however future devaluations would adversely impact the company’s future financial results any change in the rate would not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency

the decrease in the cash conversion cycle from 2014 to 2013 is due to the increase in accounts receivable days attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 which was more than offset by the increase 

 38 

in accounts payable days as a result in increased purchases towards the end of 2014 as compared to 2013 the acquisitions had the effect of increasing the cash conversion cycle by approximately 1 day in 2014 since the bubba and baby jogger results of operations were not included in the company’s results of operations for the entire fourth quarter of 2014 the decrease in the cash conversion cycle from 2012 to 2013 is due to working capital management activities the company’s cash conversion cycle is impacted by the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters based on historical trends due to inventory buildups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers 

financial position 

the company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity managing working capital and monitoring the company’s overall capitalization

borrowing arrangements 

in december 2011 the company entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks as extended the credit agreement provides for an unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in december 2019 and an aggregate commitment at any time outstanding of up to 8000 million the “facility” the facility is intended to be used for general corporate purposes and in addition provides the committed backup liquidity for the issuance of commercial paper accordingly commercial paper may be issued only up to the amount available for borrowing under the facility the facility also provides for the issuance of up to 1000 million of letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the facility as of december 31 2014  there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit issued or outstanding under the facility and the company had commercial paper obligations outstanding of 280 million  resulting in 7720 million  of borrowing capacity available under the facility 

in addition to the committed portion of the facility the credit agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders at the lenders’ discretion of up to 5000 million which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the facility

 39 

the following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the company’s shortterm borrowing arrangements during the years ended december 31  in millions  



the indentures governing the company’s mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants the company’s borrowing arrangements other than the mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum debttototalcapitalization ratios as defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods generally maximum debttototalcapitalization is calculated as the sum of shortterm and longterm debt divided by the sum of i total debt ii total stockholders’ equity and iii 7500 million related to impairment charges incurred by the company as of december 31 2014  the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and the agreements governing its other borrowing arrangements and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the facility and utilize the 7720 million  available for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debttototalcapitalization limits in its financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the facility and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

debt 

the company has varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business the volume and timing of production impacts the company’s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through shortterm financing arrangements such as commercial paper or borrowings under the facility or receivables facility 

total debt was 25 billion  and 18 billion  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively an increase of 6455 million primarily due to the net increase of 4297 million in outstanding mediumterm notes from the offering and sale of the 2875 2019  notes and the 2024 notes the aggregate proceeds of the 2875 2019 notes and 2014 notes were used to redeem 1687 million  of the 5500 million  outstanding 47  notes due 2020  redeem the 2500 million  of outstanding 20  notes due 2015  and redeem the 207 million  of outstanding 106   2019  notes the remaining increase in total debt is attributable to 2750 million of additional borrowings under the receivables facility the additional debt and operating cash flows were used for capital expenditures the repurchases under the srp and acquisitions 

as of december 31 2014  the current portion of longterm debt and shortterm debt totaled 3974 million  including 280 million  of commercial paper and 3500 million  of borrowings under the receivables facility

see footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

pension and other postretirement plan obligations 

the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets as well as prevailing market rates of interest the company made no contributions to its primary us defined benefit pension plan in 2014 the company made cash contributions of 1000 million and 485 million to its primary us defined benefit pension plan during 2013 and 2012 respectively the significant contribution the company made in 2013 was not 

 40 

material to the company’s pretax income for 2013 considering the expected return on plan assets of 75 and the company’s average borrowing rate of 30 

the company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately 700 million  to its primary us defined benefit plan in january 2015 to improve the overall funded status of the plan and offset the impacts of the adoption of new mortality tables to measure us plan liabilities the 700 million contribution is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s pretax income for 2015 considering the expected return on plan assets of 725 and the company’s average borrowing rate of 30 

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates the actual return on plan assets and various estimates regarding the timing and amount of future benefit payments for example in 2014 the projected benefit obligations of the company’s us defined benefit plans increased 773 million due to a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate and increased 1119 million due to using updated mortality assumptions 

in september 2014 the company commenced an offer to approximately 5700 former employees who have deferred vested benefits under the company’s taxqualified us pension plan these former employees had the opportunity to make a onetime election to receive a lumpsum distribution of the present value of their benefits by the end of 2014 the benefit obligations associated with these former employees is approximately 2000 million equivalent to approximately 20 of the companys benefit obligation for its us taxqualified pension plan cash payments of 986 million were made from plan assets in december 2014 to those electing the lumpsum distribution the lumpsum payment offer did not impact the company’s cash flow based on the lumpsum distributions that were paid the company incurred a noncash settlement charge of 654 million in 2014 

the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 

dividends 

the company’s board of directors approved a 13 increase in the quarterly dividend from 015 per share to 017 per share effective with the quarterly dividend paid in june 2014 in february 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a 12 increase in the quarterly dividend from 017 per share to 019 per share effective with the quarterly dividend payable in march 2015 

the company intends to maintain dividends at a level such that operating cash flows can be used to fund growth initiatives acquisitions and restructuring activities the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition earnings legal requirements payout ratio and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 

share repurchase program 

under the srp the company may repurchase its own shares of common stock through a combination of a 10b51 automatic trading plan discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions in 2014 the srp was expanded and extended to provide for over 7500 million of additional repurchases of the company’s outstanding shares from february 2014 through december 2017 during 2014  the company repurchased 114 million  shares pursuant to the srp for 3632 million  and such shares were immediately retired from the commencement of the srp in august 2011 through december 31 2014  the company has repurchased and retired a total of 244 million  shares for 6203 million  and the company has 4364 million  of authorized repurchases remaining under the srp as of december 31 2014  the repurchase of additional shares will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition liquidity and legal requirements although the srp authorizes the company to repurchase shares through the end of 2017 the company may execute such repurchases at any time and from time to time and may accelerate and complete authorized repurchases under the srp sooner than the scheduled expiration

outlook

resolution of income tax contingencies 

the company recorded 155 million and 79 million in net income tax benefits in 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters in 2012 amounts recognized as income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations were not material these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2014 2013 and 2012 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different from that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2014  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements

  42 

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time therefore the 1014 million  in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2014  is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2014  the company had liabilities net of plan assets of 4861 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

customer programs 

the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territoryspecific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers the cost of all of these various programs included as a reduction in net sales totaled 5942 million  5278 million  and 4868 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the company had accrued 2883 million and 2707 million respectively for customer programs and such amounts are included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from our customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

 43 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted the company’s reserve for uncollectible accounts was 160 million and 271 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 243 million 196 million and 358 million in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and are included in cost of products sold the company’s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and shrink reserves totaled 326 million and 378 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

business combinations 

the company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology the period of time the company expects to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates in estimating the future cash flows the company considers demand competition and other economic factors the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition 

the company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life in assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life the company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life customer loyalty brand strength and positioning the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors the company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets the company considers all other acquired intangible assets definitelived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straightline basis the company determines the amortizable life of acquired definitelived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset 

the company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results as a result the company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1 2014 for the 13 reporting units that comprise the company’s 

 44 

five operating segments acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the companys existing reporting units goodwill of 1736 million associated with the acquisitions of ignite and the assets of bubba has been included in the rubbermaid consumer reporting unit as of december 31 2014 and goodwill of 918 million associated with the acquisition of baby jogger has been included in the baby  parenting reporting unit as of december 31 2014 

as of july 1 2014 the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 24 billion four of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for over 72 of the company’s total goodwill these four reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression commercial products dymo office and industrial products  services 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the companys reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired the company determined that no interim tests of impairment of goodwill were necessary during 2014 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the companys market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 15 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company’s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting unit’s market position brand awareness gross and operating income margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the companys equity market value at july 1 2014 of approximately 86 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 20 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2014 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 10 from the 6 to 15 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company did not use the discounted cash flow approach for any of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2014 the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate longterm sales growth rate and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit 

the company has no reporting units with net assets whose estimated fair values at july 1 2014 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets

indefinitelived intangible assets 

the companys indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 3122 million as of july 1 2014 the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test additionally the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset including factors such as declines in actual or planned sales or negative or declining cash flows input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors and other entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers based on the qualitative assessment if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 

for the quantitative impairment test the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2014 and determined that none of its indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired the company performed the quantitative impairment test for the 370 million carrying value of the aprica trade name due to competitive pressures and other factors that have recently adversely impacted aprica sales in japan the company concluded the aprica trade name was not impaired however a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the aprica trade name of 86 million and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of 25 million 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2014 was not required during 2014 

potential for future impairments 

the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 25 billion  as of december 31 2014  five of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 80 of the company’s total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression commercial products dymo office rubbermaid consumer and industrial products  services the company also had 4702 million  of indefinitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2014  the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 208 million of software costs during 2014  which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in latin america 

 46 

capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2323 million  at december 31 2014  capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2014 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 336 million  as of december 31 2014  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2014  ranged between 230 million  and 283 million  as of december 31 2014  the company had a reserve of 241 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes interest and penalties the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for 

 47 

recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles by liquidity needs driving repatriations of nonus cash to the us or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign tax rates tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

  48 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014  in millions  



the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  



the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 44 to determine the expenses for 2014 for the pension and postretirement plans the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 63   to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2014 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2014 were  173  billion and 881 million  respectively the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 36 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2014 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



  

the company has 5117 million  aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses  7500 million  pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2014 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from 

 49 

changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is generally amortized to expense over the remaining life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled  210 million  pretax in 2014 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future in addition the company recognized 654 million of previously unrecognized pension losses as a settlement charge in 2014 in connection with the payment of lumpsum benefits to certain us pension plan participants changes in actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities the company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experience and previously negotiated settlements the company accrues for future lease costs net of management’s estimate for future sublease income when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used when estimating the costs of exiting facilities estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable the total restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were 462 million and 767 million respectively due to the estimates required for future payments for employee separation programs vacated leased properties and contingencies actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates

international operations 

for 2014  2013  and 2012  the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 31  33  and 33  of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentages  



the company accounts for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s venezuelan operations 

income taxes 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation and valuation allowance 

 50 

adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund and other investments included in other assets derivative instruments primarily included in prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and pension assets and liabilities included in the company’s net pension liability and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund and other investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard pricing models and marketbased assumptions for all significant inputs such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates accordingly the company’s derivative instruments are classified as level 2 the company determines the fair value of its pension assets annually primarily based on quoted market prices level 1 and the fair value of underlying investments and marketbased inputs level 2 the fair values of approximately 5 of the company’s pension assets are determined using level 3 inputs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 607 of the company’s 248 billion  of total debt as of december 31 2014 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency particularly in situations where financial instruments are not available for currencies to hedge exposures 

the company also realizes gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk gains and losses related to qualifying forward 

 52 

exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans to or from foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

as of december 31 2014 the company has 533 million of cash and cash equivalents subject to currency and currency exchange controls in venezuela the value of this cash is therefore subject to changes in value based on exchange controls implemented by the venezuelan government 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene polypropylene and copolyester while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 as follows in millions  



see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding cost and equity method investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the oneday valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

  



  

 the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

foreign operations 

information regarding the company’s 2013 2012 and 2011 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in footnote 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein information regarding risks relating to the company’s foreign operations is set forth in part i item 1a of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 

the company accounts for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting and therefore the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings in february 2013 the exchange rate for bolivar fuertes declined to 63 

 7 

bolivar fuertes to us dollar previously the company remeasured its operations denominated in bolivar fuertes at the rate of exchange used by the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme of 53 bolivar fuertes to us dollar as a result the company recorded a charge of 11 million in the first quarter of 2013 based on the decline in value of the net monetary assets of its venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivar fuertes the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of economic and political uncertainty in venezuela however such devaluations would adversely affect the company’s future financial results 

raw materials and sourced finished goods 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate and metals including steel stainless steel aluminum and gold the company’s resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene and polypropylene over the longterm the company has experienced inflation in raw material prices and the company expects continued inflation pressures in 2014 on an annualized basis commodities consumed as raw materials generally represent approximately 10 to 15 of annual cost of products sold with no single type of commodity representing more than 10 of cost of products sold 

the company also relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods historically the company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs in a limited number of cases a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line in particular certain businesses within the baby  parenting and home solutions segments rely on thirdparty manufacturers for substantially all of their products specifically the company’s baby  parenting segment has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of baby  parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

sales of the company’s products tend to be seasonal with sales and operating income in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter historically the company has earned approximately 60 of its annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year the seasonality of the company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation amortization rent personnel costs and interest expense impacts the company’s results on a quarterly basis in addition the company has historically generated more than 75 of its operating cash flow in the second half of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments and customer rebates and credit terms provided to customers

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers together with consumer shopping patterns contributes to a market environment in which dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and 

 8 

commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished 

during 2013 two of the company’s primary customers office depot and officemax merged while the company is unable to predict the financial impact and timing of such impact the merger could adversely impact the company’s net sales in the short term particularly in the writing segment to the extent there are store closures and retail inventory reductions as a result of the merger 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery producing and procuring products at a competitive cost and experienced management in addition the company focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers’ needs 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores contract stationers and ecommerce companies the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 110  of net sales in 2013 across substantially all segments the company’s topten customers in 2013 included  in alphabetical order  amazon bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn 

 9 

are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging economic conditions in the us western europe and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions including the deterioration in the creditworthiness of or a default by the issuers of sovereign debt such events could negatively impact the company’s overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands typically at lower prices that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and consolidation with other customers the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a loss of or a failure by one of the company’s large customers would adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows to address these challenges the company must be able to respond to competitive factors and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building the company is currently in the process of implementing project renewal a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization increase investment in the company’s most significant growth platforms and align the business around two key activities  brand  category development and market execution  delivery project renewal may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not result in in full or in part the positive effects anticipated in addition such initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could have a negative impact on employee engagement divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed impact the company’s ability to retain key employees cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation its longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand new product development and commercialization efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include the considerable costs involved such as development and commercialization product development or launch delays and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative 

 10 

new products that compete with the company’s products in addition sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products if new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene and polypropylene corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company’s success is dependent in part on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments while maintaining and improving margins and market share also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the company’s financial results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth and profitability could be adversely impacted 

the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully remain important factors in the company’s future growth the company’s ability to successfully integrate any acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time assume unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated and manage unanticipated demands on the company’s management operational resources and financial and internal control systems furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital the company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business or product based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner in addition prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 11 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations are important to the company’s business and the company’s strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business compliance with us laws affecting operations outside the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 1 2010 and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of the net assets excluding nonmonetary assets of operations in venezuela into us dollars are recorded in earnings in february 2013 the exchange rate for the venezuelan currency bolivar fuerte declined approximately 15 which adversely impacted the company’s financial results the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela the future results of the company’s venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors including actions by the venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations profit margin or price controls or changes in import controls economic conditions in venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending labor relations and the availability of raw materials utilities and energy the company’s venezuelan operations contribute a significant portion of the sales and operating income of the company’s latin america region as a result any disruption of the company’s venezuelan operations or of the company’s ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of the company’s latin america region and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations in particular the company’s baby  parenting business has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of baby  parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to manufacture and market its products which could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 12 

a failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business or reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting business the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to 

 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data if the it systems networks or service providers relied upon fail to function properly or if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations and reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability could require the company to record significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the company’s ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for example the united states consumer product safety commission and health canada are advocating for more strict design standards for window blinds that if implemented would require the company to redesign all window blinds sold in the us and canada for certain products redesign may not be possible or practical and as a result the company would lose revenues from the sales of such products 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted

the company may not be able to attract retain and develop key personnel 

the company’s success at implementing project renewal and the growth game plan and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses for example in february 2014 the company initiated a voluntary recall on the harness buckles used on certain gracobranded convertible and harnessed booster car seats due to the potential that over time food and dried liquid may make some harness buckles progressively more difficult to open or become stuck in the latched position the recall involves providing customers with a replacement buckle the company does not believe that a recall on similar buckles used in infant car seats is appropriate however it is possible that the regulatory agency with authority over the matter the national highway traffic safety administration may ultimately disagree and attempt to force such a recall if the recall is expanded to include infant car seats it could have an adverse impact on the results of operations of the company although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively moodys has a stable outlook on its ratings and fitch and standard  poor’s have positive outlooks on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investmentgrade could increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 14 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

actions by the company’s counterparty to the accelerated share repurchase plan may affect the market for the company’s common stock 

in connection with the company’s accelerated share repurchase plan the company expects that its counterparty will purchase shares or otherwise acquire long positions in shares of company common stock in the open market until it has acquired or otherwise has long positions in the number of shares the company has agreed to purchase under the accelerated share repurchase plan the company expects that these acquisitions and other transactions will include covering purchases to close out stock borrow positions taken on by the counterparty to make its initial deliveries of shares to the company in addition the company expects that the counterparty may be purchasing or selling or both purchasing and selling and possibly taking on other long andor short positions in company common stock in other hedging transactions related to the accelerated share repurchase plan all of these market transactions in the company’s shares or in derivative or other transactions related to company shares would be for the counterparty’s own account although the magnitude and effect of such activities on the market price of the company’s common stock cannot be determined at this time such activities may increase or prevent a decrease in the market price of the common stock

foreign currency  venezuela 

the company accounts for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting and therefore the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings in february 2013 the exchange rate for bolivar fuertes declined to 63 bolivar fuertes to us dollar previously the company remeasured its operations denominated in bolivar fuertes at the rate of exchange used by the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme of 53 bolivar fuertes to us dollar as a result the company recorded a charge of 11 million in the first quarter of 2013 based on the decline in value of the net monetary assets of its venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivar fuertes 

as of december 31 2013 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had approximately 873 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes at the rate of 63 bolivar fuertes to us dollar and as a result a 10 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would result in an estimated pretax charge benefit of 9 million on an ongoing basis excluding the impacts of any actions management might otherwise take in response to a change in exchange rates such as raising or decreasing prices a 10 increase decrease in the exchange rate would unfavorably favorably impact annual net sales and operating income by an estimated 8 million and 4 million respectively

the decrease in the cash conversion cycle from 2012 to 2013 is due to working capital management activities for 2012 the increase in accounts receivable days from 2011 is attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and this increase was offset by the combined improvements in inventory and accounts payable days the company’s cash conversion cycle is impacted by the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters based on historical trends due to inventory buildups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers the company continues to leverage the implementation of sap in north america and emea to improve working capital

in addition to the committed portion of the facility the credit agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders at the lenders’ discretion of up to 5000 million which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the facility

 37 

quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through shortterm financing arrangements such as commercial paper or borrowings under the facility or receivables facility

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets during 2013 the projected benefit obligations of the company’s defined benefit plans decreased approximately 1706 million primarily due to a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used for the company’s us defined benefit plans the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2013 the company had liabilities net of plan assets of 4053 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2013 the company had 437 million  in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2013 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

 40 

customer programs 

the company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreedupon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs coupon programs are also developed on a customer and territory specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers the cost of all of these various programs included as a reduction in net sales totaled 5299 million 4888 million and 4431 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance the company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume when incentives are paid in arrears the company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms expected customer performance andor estimated sales volume these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors which sometimes require significant judgment as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had accrued 2707 million and 2464 million respectively for customer programs and such amounts are included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from our customers among other factors actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 201 million 359 million and 245 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and are included in cost of products sold if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill 

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company as part of project renewal implemented changes to its organizational structure that resulted in an increase in the number of reportable segments from three to six and reporting units from nine to 15 based on the company’s plans to divest the hardware and teach platform businesses the goodwill of these reporting units was evaluated for impairment each reporting period subsequent to the company committing to dispose of these businesses which occurred in the first quarter of 2013 the company concluded the goodwill of the teach platform reporting unit was impaired in the first quarter of 2013 and the goodwill of the hardware reporting unit was not impaired upon further reorganization in the first quarter of 2013 and excluding the hardware and teach platform reporting units the number of reportable segments was reduced to five and the number of reporting units was reduced to 13 as a result the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1 2013 for 13 reporting units acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the company’s existing reporting units 

as of july 1 2013 the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 23 billion four of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for over 70 percent of the company’s total goodwill these four reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression commercial products dymo office and industrial products  services 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the company’s reporting units 

 41 

projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired other than the annual impairment test and tests of impairment of the hardware and teach platform reporting units in connection with the company’s plans to divest these businesses the company determined that no tests of impairment of goodwill were necessary during 2013 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the company’s reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the company’s market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the company’s market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 15 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company’s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting units market position brand awareness gross and operating income margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the company’s equity market value at july 1 2013 of approximately 76 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 20 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2013 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 10 from the 6 to 15 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the décor reporting unit for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2013 the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the projected financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate longterm sales growth rate product costs and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the décor reporting unit in 2013 the company used an average compound longterm sales growth rate of 1 average operating margins generally ranging from 4 to 9 and a discount rate of 14 the company concluded that the décor reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the décor reporting unit increased 100 basis points the décor reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the décor reporting unit was approximately 19 million as of july 1 2013 

the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of the décor reporting unit as the décor reporting unit has been adversely affected by a change in merchandising strategies at one of its key customers the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and are successful in improving the financial performance of the décor reporting unit to the extent the company is not successful 

 42 

in implementing these projects and strategies it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with the décor reporting unit in future periods 

the company has no reporting units with material net assets whose estimated fair values at july 1 2013 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting units net assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 3106 million as of july 1 2013 the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test additionally the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset including factors such as declines in actual or planned sales or negative or declining cash flows input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors and other entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers based on the qualitative assessment if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 

for the quantitative impairment test the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2013 and determined that none of its indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2013 was not required during 2013 

potential for future impairments 

the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 24 billion  as of december 31 2013 four of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 72 percent of the company’s total goodwill these four reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression commercial products dymo office and industrial products  services the company also had 3124 million  of indefinitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2013 the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software 

 43 

in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 324 million of software costs during 2013 which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in brazil as well as the planned rollout in 2014 of sap in the remaining countries in latin america capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2519 million  at december 31 2013 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2013 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 344 million  as of december 31 2013 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2013 ranged between 204 million  and 230 million  as of december 31 2013 the company had a reserve of 210 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

 44 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

see footnote 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

  45 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013  in millions  



the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  



the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 37 to determine the expenses for 2013 for the pension and postretirement plans the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 64   to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2013 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2013 were  165  billion and 1118 million  respectively the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 44 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2013 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



  

the company has 4833 million  aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses  7160 million  pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2013 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets 

 46 

being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled  337 million  pretax in 2013 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

restructuring 

the company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities the company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experience and previously negotiated settlements the company accrues for future lease costs net of management’s estimate for future sublease income when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable the total restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were 767 million and 413 million respectively due to the estimates required for future payments for employee separation programs vacated leased properties and contingencies actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—footnote 1—description of business and significant accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

international operations 

for 2013 2012 and 2011 the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 32  33  and 34  of net sales respectively see footnote 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentages  



the company accounts for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings 

in 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar since the introduction of sitme in june 2010 the venezuelan government held the rate constant at 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar until february 2013 

in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar fuerte “bolivar” resulting in the exchange rate declining from 53  to 63  bolivars to us dollar because the company considers venezuela a highly inflationary economy the change in the exchange rate resulted in foreign exchange losses of  111 million  during the 12 months ended december 31 2013 these foreign exchange losses represent the impact of the devaluation on the bolivardenominated net monetary assets of the company’s venezuelan operations as of december 31 2013 the company’s venezuelan operations had approximately 873 million  in bolivardenominated net monetary assets in future periods foreign exchange gains losses arising due to the appreciation depreciation of the bolivar versus the us dollar will result in onetime benefits charges based on the value of the bolivardenominated net monetary assets at the time when such exchange rate changes become effective during 2013 2012 and 2011 the company’s venezuelan operations generated 14  or less of consolidated net sales 

the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela however future devaluations would adversely impact the company’s future financial results any change in the rate would not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency 

 47 

income taxes 

the company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in taxrelated legislation by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

the company’s effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation and valuation allowance adjustments significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets and ultimately the income tax provision 

it is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate and the company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items for example if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved the company will recognize period tax benefits conversely to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved the company will recognize incremental period tax expense these matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund investments included in other assets and derivative instruments primarily included in prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard pricing models and marketbased assumptions for all significant inputs such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates accordingly the company’s derivative instruments are classified as level 2

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 496 of the company’s 184 billion  of total debt as of december 31 2013 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency particularly in situations where financial instruments are not available for currencies to hedge exposures 

 49 

the company also realizes gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans to or from foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

as of december 31 2013 the company has 879 million of cash and cash equivalents subject to currency and currency exchange controls in venezuela the value of this cash is therefore subject to changes in value based on exchange controls implemented by the venezuelan government 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene representing twothirds and onethird of quantities purchased respectively while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 as follows in millions  



see footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding cost and equity method investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the oneday valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

  



  

 the yearoveryear decrease in average valueatrisk for interest rates is primarily due to the company swapping a fixed rate for a shortterm floating rate for 500 million of the company’s mediumterm notes due 2020 during 2012 because the shortterm rate has less risk compared to the longerterm rate because the fixedforfloating swap was in effect for all of 2013 the average interest rate market risk is lower for 2013 

the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could 

 50 

experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

foreign operations 

information regarding the company’s 2012 2011 and 2010 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein information regarding risks relating to the company’s foreign operations is set forth in part i item 1a of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 

the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings in june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar the company began applying the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar in may 2010 the transition to the sitme rate resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 56 million which is recognized in other income for 2010 the sitme rate has remained unchanged at 53 bolivar fuerte since june 2010 and consequently there was no foreign exchange gain or loss recorded for the company’s venezuelan operations during 2011 and 2012 

as of december 31 2012 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had 634 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes at the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuertes to us dollar and as a result a 10 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would result in an estimated onetime pretax charge benefit of 6 million on an ongoing basis excluding the impacts of any actions management might otherwise take in response to a change in exchange rates such as raising or decreasing prices a 10 increase decrease in the exchange rate would unfavorably favorably impact annual net sales and operating income by an estimated 5 million and 3 million respectively 

in february 2013 the exchange rate for bolivar fuertes declined to 63 bolivar fuertes to us dollar and as a result the company expects to record an estimated 10 million onetime charge in the first quarter of 2013 based on the decline in value of the net monetary assets of its venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivar fuertes at the time the devaluation is effective in addition the company’s 2013 reported net sales and operating income are expected to be adversely impacted by an estimated 9 million and 5 million respectively due solely to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela however future devaluations would adversely impact the company’s future financial results 

raw materials and sourced finished goods 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate and metals including steel stainless steel zinc aluminum and gold the company’s resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities over the longterm the company has experienced inflation in raw material prices and the company expects continued inflation pressures 

in 2013 the company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through rationalizing and exiting product lines on an annualized basis commodities consumed as raw materials generally represent approximately 10 to 15 of annual cost of products sold with no single type of commodity representing more than 10 of cost of products sold 

the company also relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods in a limited number of cases a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line in particular certain businesses within the baby  parenting and home solutions segments rely on thirdparty manufacturers for substantially all of their products 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

sales of the company’s products tend to be seasonal with sales and operating income in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter historically the company has earned more than 60 of its annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year the seasonality of the company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation amortization rent personnel costs and interest expense impacts the company’s results on a quarterly basis in addition the company has historically generated more than 60 of its operating cash flow in the second half of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments and customer rebates and credit terms provided to customers 

patents and trademarks

customerscompetition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the rapid growth of large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns has contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands which compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery producing and procuring products at a competitive cost and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores and contract stationers the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 108  of net sales in 2012 across substantially all segments the company’s topten customers in 2012 included  in alphabetical order  bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot officemax staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the companys business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging and volatile economic conditions in the us western europe and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the companys products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions including the deterioration in the creditworthiness of or a default by the issuers of sovereign debt such events could negatively impact the companys overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact the companys business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and ecommerce companies 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the companys principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs office superstores commercial distributors and ecommerce companies the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers and ecommerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers and ecommerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers and ecommerce companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the companys products 

the combination of these market influences and retailer consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the companys principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and consolidation the intense competition in the retail and ecommerce sectors combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a failure by one of the companys large customers would adversely impact the companys sales and operating cash flows as a result of these factors the company may experience a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the companys plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the companys success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building in october 2011 the company announced project renewal a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the companys most significant growth platforms and in october 2012 the company announced an expansion of project renewal designed to further simplify and align the business around two key activities — brand  category development and market execution  delivery as part of the expanded program the companys consumer and professional groups were eliminated and the companys nine global business units were streamlined into six business segments in june 2010 the company announced its european transformation plan a program to centralize its european business and leverage the benefits of scale and to facilitate a more efficient and costeffective implementation of an enterprise resource planning program the company runs the risk that these and similar initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated in addition these various initiatives require the company to implement a significant amount of organizational change which could divert management’s attention from other concerns and if not properly managed could cause disruptions in the company’s daytoday operations and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the companys ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the companys longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the companys products the companys strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the companys ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the companys retailer and other customers will need the companys products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the companys financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene and polypropylene corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the companys productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the companys financial results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the companys future growth could be adversely impacted 

although the company is increasingly emphasizing internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the companys ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the companys future growth furthermore the companys ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the companys financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the companys borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the companys future access to capital 

circumstances associated with divestitures and product lines exits could adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business or product based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner in addition prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the companys business and the companys strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 1 2010 and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of the net assets excluding nonmonetary assets of operations in venezuela into us dollars are recorded in earnings in february 2013 the exchange rate for the venezuelan currency bolivar fuerte declined approximately 15 which will adversely impact the company’s financial results the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela however future devaluations would adversely impact the company’s future financial results see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the companys ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations in particular the companys baby  parenting business has a single source of supply for many of its products financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the companys suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the companys relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand 

complications in connection with the companys current information system initiative may adversely impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap through december 31 2012 the north american and european operations of substantially all of the companys six segments have successfully gone live with their sap implementation efforts the companys asia pacific and latin american operations have yet to go live on sap this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees roles in 

processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the companys customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the manner in which the company takes orders procures materials schedules production remits billings makes payments and performs other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the companys ability to perform necessary business transactions including its ability to supply products on a timely basis the companys golives have been and will continue to be in a phased approach to reduce the risk of business disruption throughout the companys business units and regions however there can be no assurance that the risk of business disruption can be eliminated with the companys phased approach all of these risks could adversely impact the companys results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the companys assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the companys relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the companys stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the companys businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the companys ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability could require the company to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the companys results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the companys ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the companys results of operations for example the united states consumer product safety commission continues to advocate for more strict design standards for window blinds that if implemented would require the company to redesign all window blinds sold in the us for certain products redesign may not be possible or practical and as a result the company would lose revenues from the sales of such products 

as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change the companys financial results could be impacted 

the resolution of the companys tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the companys cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment is required in determining the companys worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the companys business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the companys financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the companys products arise in the ordinary course of the companys business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the companys reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the companys products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under 

the terms of the policy 

if the company is unable to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing debt its borrowing costs could increase 

as of december 31 2012 the company had 2119 million  of debt that it will be required to refinance or repay within the next 12 months it is possible that the company may seek to address its shortterm obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured and although the company believes that alternative arrangements will be available to refinance these obligations such arrangements could result in an increase in the companys borrowing costs 

a reduction in the companys credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the companys current senior debt credit ratings from moodys investors service standard  poors and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moodys investors service standard  poors and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively moodys standard  poors and fitch have a stable outlook on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moodys or standard  poors which would reduce the companys senior debt below investmentgrade could increase the companys borrowing costs which would adversely affect the companys financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the companys shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the companys access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the companys securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the companys earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the companys pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the companys pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the companys estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the companys required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the companys future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the companys pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

key initiatives 

project renewal 

in october 2011 the company launched project renewal a program designed to reduce complexity in the organization and increase investment in the most significant growth platforms within the business funded by a reduction in structural selling general  administrative ”sga” costs the consolidation of a limited number of manufacturing facilities and distribution centers was also initiated as part of the program with the goal of increasing operational efficiency reducing costs and improving gross margin in october 2012 the company committed to an expansion of project renewal designed to further simplify and align the business around two key activities — brand  category development and market execution  delivery as expanded project renewal encompasses projects centered around five workstreams as follows 

 

the following table depicts estimated pretax restructuring and restructuringrelated costs annualized savings and headcount impacts associated with project renewal  dollars in millions  



 project renewal in total is expected to be fully implemented by mid2015 with annualized savings of 90 to 100 million expected by the first half of 2013 the majority of the savings from project renewal will be invested in the business to unlock accelerated growth and to strengthen brand building and selling capabilities in priority markets around the world 

since the inception of project renewal through december 31 2012 the company has reduced structural overhead and consolidated three operating groups into two and 13 gbus into nine which resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 175 employees in 2012 the company completed the closure of the home solutions segments greenville texas manufacturing facility aiming to consolidate operations of the facility into the companys existing facilities in kansas and ohio the company also began implementing a distribution center consolidation in the home solutions segment as well as a project to align the home solutions segments sales and marketing organizations with the companys newly created customer development organization in the tools and the commercial products segments the company began reorganizing its sales and marketing functions and began a project to centralize commercial products distribution operations in the specialty segment the company began a project to close one of its us manufacturing facilities in lowell indiana in the fourth quarter of 2012 the companys consumer and professional groups were eliminated and the companys nine gbus were streamlined into six business segments 

european transformation plan 

in june 2010 the company announced a program to centralize its european business the “european transformation plan” the european transformation plan includes initiatives designed to transform the european organizational structure and processes to centralize certain operating activities improve performance leverage the benefits of scale and to facilitate a more efficient and costeffective implementation of sap an enterprise resource planning system in europe all with the aim of increasing operating margin in the european region to approximately 10 as of december 31 2012 the company had completed the implementation of its european transformation plan initiative with cumulative restructuring and restructuringrelated costs of 38 million  and 77 million  respectively the european transformation plan was expected to result in the realization of annual aftertax savings 

of 55 to 65 million and substantially all of these savings have been realized and were included in the company’s 2011 and 2012 operating results 

in april 2012 the company migrated its enterprise resource planning systems in europe to sap and began operating in a centralized european business model since the company reports sales and operating income based on the region from which the products are shipped and invoiced to external customers and the new model defines how certain regions import and export products the new model impacted the regions in which the company’s sales and operating income are reported in 2012 compared to prior periods the new model generally results in the european region’s sales and operating income being lower with corresponding increases in the company’s other regions

the company continues to evaluate and optimize nonstrategic sga expenditures throughout the organization including centralizing indirect procurement to better leverage the companys spend

in addition to the committed portion of the facility the credit agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders at the lenders’ discretion of up to 5000 million which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the facility

the indentures governing the company’s mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants the company’s borrowing arrangements other than the mediumterm notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum debttototalcapitalization ratios as defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods generally maximum debttototalcapitalization is calculated as the sum of shortterm and longterm debt divided by the sum of i total debt ii total stockholders’ equity and iii a specified dollar amount ranging from 5500 million to 7500 million related to impairment charges incurred by the company as of december 31 2012 the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the facility and utilize the 8000 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debttototalcapitalization limits in its financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the facility and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

debt

 the following table presents the average outstanding debt and weightedaverage interest rates for the years ended december 31  in millions except percentages

the company’s floatingrate debt which includes mediumterm notes that are subject to fixedforfloating interest rate swaps was 517 and 177 of total debt as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in floatingrate debt is primarily due to fixedforfloating interest rate swaps related to 5000 million of 47 mediumterm notes due 2020 that were entered into during 2012 whereas in 2011 the company terminated and settled fixedforfloating interest rate swaps relating to 7500 million principal amount of mediumterm notes additionally borrowings under the receivables facility were 2000 million at december 31 2012 an increase of 1000 million compared to december 31 2011 see footnote 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details

the company sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets as well as the interest rate environment in 2012 and 2011 the company made cash contributions of 485 million and 204 million respectively to its primary us defined benefit pension plan the company expects to contribute approximately 144 million to its worldwide pension and other postretirement plans in 2013 which includes 100 million contributed in january 2013 to its primary us defined benefit pension plan 

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets during 2012 the projected benefit obligations of the company’s defined benefit plans increased approximately 170 million primarily due to the decline in interest rates the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 

dividends 

the company’s board of directors approved a 25 increase in the company’s quarterly dividend from 008 per share to 010 per share effective with the quarterly dividend paid in june 2012 and further increased the quarterly dividend by 50 from 010 per share to 015 per share effective with the companys dividend paid in december 2012 the company intends to maintain dividends at a level such that operating cash flows can be used to fund growth initiatives and restructuring activities and at the companys discretion to repay outstanding debt 

the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition earnings legal requirements payout ratio and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 

share repurchase program 

in august 2011 the company announced a 3000 million  share repurchase program the “srp” under the srp the company may repurchase its own shares of common stock through a combination of a 10b51 automatic trading plan discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions the srp is authorized to run for a period of three years ending in august 2014 during 2012 the company repurchased 49 million  shares pursuant to the srp for 915 million  and such shares were immediately retired from the commencement of the srp in august 2011 through december 31 2012 the company has repurchased and retired a total of 83 million  shares for 1376 million  during january 2013 the company purchased an additional 05 million shares at an aggregate cost of 123 million the repurchase of additional shares will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition liquidity and legal requirements 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies the company’s current senior and shortterm debt credit ratings from three credit rating agencies are listed below 



outlook 

for the year ending december 31 2013 the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of 575 to 625 million after restructuring and restructuringrelated cash payments of 70 to 90 million and approximately 100 million in contributions to the company’s primary us pension plan the company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately 175 to 200 million which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap in brazil 

overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operations access to capital markets and availability under the facility and receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses the company plans to use available cash borrowing capacity cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to repay debt maturities as they come due including shortterm debt of 2107 million  primarily representing borrowings under the receivables facility 

resolution of income tax contingencies 

in 2011 and 2010 the company recorded 490 million and 793 million respectively in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters in 2012 amounts recognized as income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations were not material these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2012 2011 and 2010 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different from that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2012 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 

the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the company’s cash flow in the indicated period in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions 



 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1127 million in unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at december 31 2012 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2012 the company had liabilities of 7277 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans for which the company expects to make contributions of 144 million in 2013 see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2012 the company had 457 million  in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2012 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 383 million 269 million and 184 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and are included in cost of products sold if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill 

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the companys goodwill is assigned to the companys reporting units for the company’s annual impairment testing in 2012 reporting units which were referred to as the companys global business units “gbu” were one level below the operating segment level effective january 1 2012 the company as part of project renewal implemented certain changes to its organizational structure that resulted in the consolidation of the companys 13 global business units gbu into nine and as a result the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing for the nine gbus acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the companys existing reporting units 

as of july 1 2012 the company had nine reporting units with total goodwill of 24 billion four of the companys nine reporting units accounted for over 70 percent of the companys total goodwill these four reporting units were as follows writing  creative expression commercial products technology and industrial products  services 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the companys reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired other than the annual impairment test the company determined that no tests of impairment were necessary during 2012 

in the companys goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the companys internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the companys market capitalization plus an equity 

control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the companys market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 10 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the companys total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting units market position brand awareness gross and operating margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the companys equity market value at july 1 2012 of approximately 53 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 20 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2012 if each reporting units ebitda multiple were reduced by 10 from the 6 to 10 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the technology reporting unit for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2012 the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate longterm sales growth rate and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the technology reporting unit in 2012 the company used an average compound longterm sales growth rate of 2 average operating margins generally ranging from 14 to 18 and a discount rate of 12 the company concluded that the technology reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the technology reporting unit increased 100 basis points the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have declined by approximately 60 million and would have resulted in a fair value which was approximately 1 less than the net assets of the reporting unit additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether the technology reporting units goodwill was impaired and to the extent goodwill was impaired the magnitude of the impairment charge the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the technology reporting unit was approximately 360 million as of july 1 2012 

the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of the technology reporting unit the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and are successful in improving the financial performance of the reporting unit to the extent the company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with the technology reporting unit in future periods the technology reporting unit has been adversely affected by the decline in government spending and its impact on the classroom technology industry as well as weaker macroeconomic conditions throughout western europe 

other than the technology reporting unit the company has no reporting units whose estimated fair values at july 1 2012 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting units net assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

the companys indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 3101 million as of july 1 2012 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 201202  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  which permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test under asu 201202 the company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test additionally the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset including factors such as declines in actual or planned revenue or negative or declining cash flows input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors and other entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers based on the qualitative assessment if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 

for the quantitative impairment test the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2012 and determined that none of its indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2012 was not required during 2012 

potential for future impairments 

as of december 31 2012 the company had goodwill of 24 billion  and indefinitelived intangible assets of 3111 million  the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the companys market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 439 million of software costs during 2012 which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in the european region and in brazil capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2692 million  at december 31 2012 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2012 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical 

condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 330 million  as of december 31 2012 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2012 ranged between 219 million  and 254 million  as of december 31 2012 the company had a reserve of 223 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012  in millions  



the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  



the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 46 to determine the expenses for 2012 for the pension and postretirement plans the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 69 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2012 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2012 were 177 billion and 1588 million  respectively the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 37 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2012 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



  

the company has 6211 million  aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses  9313 million  pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2012 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled 248 million pretax in 2012 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—footnote 1—description of business and significant accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

international operations 

for 2012 2011 and 2010 the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 32  33  and 32  of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentages  



the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings as of december 31 2012 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had 634 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes and as a result a 10 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would result in a onetime estimated pretax charge benefit of 6 million on an ongoing basis excluding the impacts of any actions management might otherwise take in response to a change in exchange rates such as raising or decreasing prices a 10 increase decrease in the exchange rate would unfavorably favorably impact annual net sales and operating income by an estimated 5 million and 3 million respectively 

in may 2010 the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its foreign currency exchange control regulations to close down the parallel exchange market in early june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at 

the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar the company began applying the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar in may 2010 the transition to the sitme rate from the parallel rate did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated net sales or operating income for 2010 compared to using the parallel rate for the same period the transition to the sitme rate did result in a onetime foreign exchange gain of 56 million which is recognized in other income in 2010 since the introduction of sitme in june 2010 the venezuelan government held the rate constant at 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar until february 2013 in february 2013 the exchange rate for bolivar fuertes declined to 63 bolivar fuertes to us dollar and the sitme rate is no longer available as a result the company expects to record an estimated 10 million onetime charge in the first quarter of 2013 based on the decline in value of the net monetary assets of its venezuelan operations that are denominated in bolivar fuertes at the time the devaluation is effective in addition the company’s 2013 reported net sales and operating income are expected to be adversely impacted by an estimated 9 million and 5 million respectively due solely to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte 

the company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in venezuela however future devaluations would adversely impact the company’s future financial results any change in the rate would not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund investments included in other assets and derivative instruments primarily included in prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard pricing models and marketbased assumptions for all significant inputs such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates accordingly the company’s derivative instruments are classified as level 2 

forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 483 of the company’s 192 billion  of total debt as of december 31 2012 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 

the company also realizes gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk the company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans with forward contracts and crosscurrency hedges gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012 as follows in millions  



see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding cost and equity method investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the oneday valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

  



  

 the yearoveryear decline in valueatrisk for interest rates is primarily due to the company swapping a fixed rate for a shortterm floating rate for 500 million of the company’s mediumterm notes due 2020 because the shortterm rate has less risk compared to the longerterm rate and the shorterterm rate has less historical volatility the yearoveryear decline in valueatrisk for foreign exchange is due to generally lower foreign currency positions at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 and lower exchange rate volatility in late 2012 compared to late 2011 

the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings in june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar the company began applying the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar in may 2010 the transition to the sitme rate resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 56 million which is recognized in other income for 2010 the sitme rate has remained 

unchanged at 53 bolivar fuerte since june 2010 and consequently there was no foreign exchange gain or loss recorded for the companys venezuelan operations during 2011 as of december 31 2011 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had 432 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes and a 5 increasedecrease in the applicable exchange rate would decreaseincrease the company’s pretax income by 22 million

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment may limit the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands 

and differentiated products delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to lowcost suppliers and lowercost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores and contract stationers the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 110  of net sales in 2011 across substantially all gbus the company’s topten customers in 2011 included  in alphabetical order  bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot officemax staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the companys business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging and increasingly volatile economic conditions in the us western europe and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the companys products as well as its financial condition and results of operations the company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in specific countries or regions including the deterioration in the creditworthiness of or a default by the issuers of sovereign debt such events could negatively impact the companys overall liquidity andor create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact the companys business 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the companys principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and 

to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the companys products 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the companys principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in category management and customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation the intense competition in the retail sector combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of retailers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future in particular a failure by one of the companys large retail customers would adversely impact the companys sales and operating cash flows as a result of these factors the company may experience a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the companys ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the companys longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the companys products the companys strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the companys ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the companys retailer and other customers will need the companys products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the companys financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene and polypropylene corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process also the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the companys productivity gains and price increases and adversely impact the companys financial results 

the companys plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the companys success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building in october 2011 the company announced project renewal a global initiative designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the companys most significant growth platforms in june 2010 the company announced its european transformation plan a program to simplify and centralize its european business and leverage the benefits of scale and to contribute to a more efficient and costeffective implementation of an enterprise resource planning program the company runs the risk that these and similar initiatives may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the companys future growth could be adversely impacted 

although the company is increasingly emphasizing internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the companys ability to 

continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the companys future growth furthermore the companys ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the companys financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the companys borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the companys future access to capital 

circumstances associated with divestitures could adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner in addition prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the companys business and the companys strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in reliance on foreign sourcing 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 1 2010 and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of the net assets excluding nonmonetary assets of operations in venezuela into us dollars are recorded in earnings see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the companys ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the companys suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the companys relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand 

complications in connection with the companys current information system initiative may adversely impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap to date the north american operations of substantially all of the companys 13 gbus have successfully gone live with their sap implementation efforts these golives are the first major milestones in a multiyear implementation that will occur in several phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the companys customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the manner in which the company takes orders procures materials schedules production remits billings makes payments and performs other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the companys ability to perform necessary business transactions including its ability to supply products on a timely basis the companys golives have been and will continue to be in a phased approach to reduce the risk of business disruption throughout the companys business units and regions however there can be no assurance that the risk of business disruption can be eliminated with the companys phased approach all of these risks could adversely impact the companys results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the companys assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation a material adverse change in the companys relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the companys stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the companys businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the companys ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability could require the company to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the companys results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis significantly restrict the companys ability to sell certain products or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the companys results of operations lastly as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change the companys financial results could be impacted 

the resolution of the companys tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the companys cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment is required in determining the companys worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the companys business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the companys financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the companys products arise in the ordinary course of the companys business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the companys reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the companys products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product 

liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

if the company is unable to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing debt its borrowing costs could increase 

as of december 31 2011 the company had 3675 million  of debt that it will be required to refinance or repay within the next 12 months it is possible that the company may seek to address its shortterm obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured and although the company believes that alternative arrangements will be available to refinance these obligations such arrangements could result in an increase in the companys borrowing costs 

a reduction in the companys credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the companys current senior debt credit ratings from moodys investors service standard  poors and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moodys investors service standard  poors and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively moodys standard  poors and fitch have a stable outlook on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moodys or standard  poors which would reduce the companys senior debt below investmentgrade could increase the companys borrowing costs which would adversely affect the companys financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the companys shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would limit or eliminate entirely the companys access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the companys securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the companys earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the companys pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the companys pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the companys estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the companys required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the companys future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the companys pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

 key initiatives 

project renewal 

in october 2011 the company launched project renewal a program designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in the most significant growth platforms within the business funded by a reduction in structural selling general  administrative sga costs cost savings from the program are expected to be achieved in large part through the consolidation of three operating groups into two — newell professional and newell consumer — and of 13 gbus into nine with the baby  parenting gbu operating as a standalone operating segment 

in connection with the program the company expects to incur cash costs of 75 to 90 million and record pretax restructuring charges in the range of 90 to 100 million through the end of 2012 the majority of which are employeerelated cash costs including severance retirement and other termination benefits and costs charges of between 55 and 70 million are expected to be incurred in 2012 the consolidation of a limited number of manufacturing facilities and distribution centers has also been initiated as part of the program with the goal of increasing operational efficiency reducing costs and improving gross margin and the company estimates a total net headcount reduction of approximately 500 resulting from project renewal through december 31 2011 the company has incurred restructuring charges of approximately 31 million  under project renewal 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company began reducing structural overhead to facilitate the consolidation of the three operating groups into two and the 13 gbus into nine which resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 175 employees in addition the company announced the closure of the greenville texas manufacturing facility with the operations of the facility being consolidated into the companys existing manufacturing facilities in the states of kansas and ohio 

the company expects to generate cost savings of approximately 90 to 100 million when the program is fully implemented by the end of 2012 the majority of the savings will be reinvested in the business to unlock accelerated growth 

european transformation plan 

in june 2010 the company announced a program to simplify and centralize its european business the “european transformation plan” the european transformation plan includes initiatives designed to transform the european organizational structure and processes to centralize certain operating activities improve performance leverage the benefits of scale and to contribute to a more efficient and costeffective implementation of an enterprise resource planning system in europe all with the aim of increasing operating margin in the european region to at least ten percent 

the european transformation plan is expected to result in aggregate restructuring and other planrelated costs of 110 to 115 million the european transformation plan is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 and is expected to result in cumulative restructuring charges totaling between 40 and 45 million substantially all of which are employeerelated cash costs including severance retirement and other termination benefits and relocation costs the company also expects to incur an additional 70 to 75 million of incremental selling general and administrative expenses referred to herein as restructuringrelated charges to implement the european transformation plan through december 31 2011 the company has incurred restructuring and restructuringrelated charges of approximately 19 million  and 53 million respectively under the european transformation plan the company expects to realize annual aftertax savings of 55 to 65 million upon completion of the implementation of the european transformation plan the majority of which have been realized and are included in the companys 2011 operating results 

in 2011 as part of its european transformation plan the company completed the relocation of key personnel to geneva switzerland in addition the company vacated and closed offices in two locations in the european region the company has also undertaken various projects to maximize gross margins and centralize operations in the region 

one newell rubbermaid 

the company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its gbus and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork through this initiative the company has established regional shared service centers to leverage nonmarketfacing functional capabilities to reduce costs in addition the company has consolidated the leadership and strategic operations of five of the company’s gbus into the company’s headquarters facilities to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and better leverage best practices 

the company is also migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap global information platform in a phased multiyear rollout sap is expected to enable the company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently through december 31 2011 the north american operations of substantially all of the companys 13 gbus have successfully gone live with their sap implementation efforts including the north american operations of the décor gbu which was the last to go live in august 2011 the company’s european operations are expected to go live on sap in the first half of 2012 

consolidated results of operations 

the company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of operations are important in evaluating the companys operations the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  



results of operations — 2011 vs 2010 

net sales for 2011 were 58646 million  representing an increase of 2064 million  or 36  from 56582 million  for 2010 

the following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 in millions except percentages  



core sales increased 18  compared to the prior year driven by growth in the company’s international businesses particularly in emerging markets with doubledigit core sales growth in the latin america and asia pacific regions across substantially all segments excluding foreign currency sales at the company’s international and north american businesses increased 35 and 12 respectively foreign currency contributed 18  to the increase in net sales 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2011 was 376  or 22052 million  versus 380  of net sales or 21487 million  for 2010 the primary driver of the 40 basis point gross margin decrease was input and sourced product cost inflation partially offset by pricing and productivity 

sga expenses for 2011 were 258  of net sales or 15153 million  versus 256  of net sales or 14478 million  for 2010 in constant currency sga expenses increased 366 million due to 398 million of incremental investments in brandbuilding and other strategic sga activities to support marketing initiatives advertising and promotions new market entries and global expansion sga expenses for 2011 include 63 million of incremental costs incurred due to the companys chief executive officer transition and an increase of 222 million in restructuringrelated costs for the european transformation plan the aforementioned increases were partially offset by 317 million lower structural sga costs which resulted primarily from lower incentive compensation costs in 2011 compared to 2010 

as a result of the companys annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 3826 million  during 2011 principally relating to the impairment of goodwill in the companys baby  parenting and hardware gbus there were no similar charges recorded during 2010 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 501 million  and 774 million  for 2011 and 2010 respectively the yearoveryear decrease in restructuring costs was attributable to the completion of project acceleration in 2010 the restructuring costs for 2011 relate to project renewal and the european transformation plan and consisted of 84 million  of facility and other exit and impairment costs 332 million  of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 85 million  of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs the restructuring costs in 2010 primarily relate to project acceleration and included 60 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 535 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 179 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating income for 2011 was 44  of net sales or 2572 million  versus 110  of net sales or 6235 million  for 2010 excluding the impact of the 3826 million of impairment charges which were 65 of net sales operating income for 2011 would be 6398 million or 109 of net sales for 2011

core sales increased 46  compared to the prior year resulting from higher volumes primarily due to increases in demand particularly internationally and restocking by customers in anticipation of future increases in consumer demand particularly in the geographic regions and channels where inventories were reduced in late 2008 and early 2009 the higher volumes were also attributable to new products launched during 2010 distribution gains and geographic expansion core sales at the company’s north american and international businesses increased approximately 36 and 79 respectively versus the prior year product line exits reduced yearoveryear sales by 15  while foreign currency had a negligible impact 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2010 was 380  or 21487 million  versus 370  of net sales or 20301 million  for 2009 the primary drivers of the 100 basis point gross margin improvement were productivity gains from several initiatives including project acceleration and improved product mix partially offset by input cost inflation 

sga expenses for 2010 were 256  of net sales or 14478 million  versus 247  of net sales or 13548 million  for 2009 with currency having a negligible impact on the yearoveryear increase approximately 30 basis points of the 90 basis point increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to restructuringrelated charges incurred in connection with the european transformation plan in 2010 the remaining increase was mainly due to the company’s increased spend for brandbuilding and other strategic sga activities such as marketing initiatives advertising and promotions sales force increases and the implementation of sap 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 774 million and 1000 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in restructuring costs is largely attributable to lower costs associated with reducing the company’s manufacturing and distribution footprint as the company completed project acceleration in 2010 in addition the company incurred lower restructuring costs associated with restructuring programs focused on streamlining the organizational structure to reduce structural sga costs the restructuring costs for 2010 included 60 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 535 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 179 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs the restructuring costs for 2009 included 324 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 488 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 188 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating income for 2010 was 110  of net sales or 6235 million  versus 105  of net sales or 5753 million  for 2009 the 50 basis point improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to productivity gains and improved product mix combined with lower restructuring costs and better leverage of structural sga as a result of increased sales partially offset by increased spend for brandbuilding and other strategic sga activities and input cost inflation

optimization plan and the charges were deductible at a higher rate than the company’s overall tax rate as a result of the charges associated with the capital structure optimization plan the company recognized lower income tax expense and a lower effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2011 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 

the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the companys cash flow in the indicated period in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2011 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions 



 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under audit from timetotime by the irs and other taxing authorities and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1005 million in unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at december 31 2011 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2011 the company had liabilities of 6609 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans for which the company expects to make contributions of 1050 million in 2012 see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2011 the company had 465 million  in standby letters of credit primarily related to the companys selfinsurance programs including workers compensation product liability and medical see footnote 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2011 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the companys accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the companys critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 269 million 184 million and 570 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and are included in cost of products sold if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the companys goodwill is assigned to the companys reporting units reporting units which are referred to as the companys global business units “gbu” are one level below the operating segment level the gbu is the companys core organizing concept and each gbu supports one or more of the companys key brands worldwide the company has not had any material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since january 1 2009 due to restructuring activities or otherwise acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the companys existing reporting units 

the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 28 billion as of july 1 2011 prior to the completion of its annual impairment testing five of the companys 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 70 percent of the companys total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows baby  parenting rubbermaid commercial products industrial products  services markers highlighters art  office organization and technology 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the companys reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired other than the annual impairment test the company determined that no tests of impairment were necessary during 2011 

in the companys goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the companys internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the companys market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 12 in using the ebitda multiples the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the companys total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting units market position brand awareness gross and operating margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the companys equity market value at july 1 2011 of approximately 47 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately 22 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2011 if each reporting units ebitda multiple were reduced by 10 from the 6 to 12 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2011 the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material and sourced product costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units in 2011 the company generally used average compound longterm sales growth rates of 2 to 3 average operating margins of 7 to 9 and discount rates ranging from 12 to 14 the company concluded that the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units did not pass step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment if any based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill step two the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets such as trade names and customer relationships and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting units recognized and unrecognized intangible assets the estimated values of the reporting units intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting units total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill based on the results of step one tests performed for each reporting unit as of july 1 2011 the company determined that step two tests were required for the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units 

the company determined goodwill at its baby  parenting and hardware reporting units was impaired using the discounted cash flow approach in step two of the goodwill impairment test the impairments generally resulted from declines in sales projections relative to previous estimates due to economic and market factors based in large part on actual declines in sales in the first half of 2011 which adversely impacted projected operating margins and net cash flows for these reporting units the decline in anticipated future cash flows adversely affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units and resulted in the estimated fair value of the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units being less than their net assets including goodwill 

the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of 3055 million and 647 million for the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units respectively the company’s baby  parenting reporting unit had 1340 million of goodwill remaining at december 31 2011 and the company’s hardware reporting unit had no goodwill remaining at december 31 2011 with respect to the discounted cash flow analysis used to determine the estimated fair value of the baby  parenting reporting unit if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the baby  parenting reporting unit decreased 100 basis points the estimated value of the reporting unit would have increased 73 million as a result the baby  parenting reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test and therefore the company would not have recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the baby  parenting reporting unit in 2011 if the discount rate increased 100 basis points the estimated fair value of the baby  parenting reporting unit would have declined by approximately 58 million which would have resulted in additional impairment charges recorded during 2011 for the baby  parenting reporting unit in step two of the goodwill impairment test for the baby  parenting reporting unit the company estimated the value of the baby  parenting trade names using a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which requires an estimate of royalties that could be derived in the future use of the assets were the company to license the use of the trade names if the estimated value assigned to the trade names increases the implied fair value of the goodwill decreases and results in a greater impairment charge and if the estimated value assigned to the trade names decreases the implied fair value of the goodwill increases and results in a lower impairment charge in valuing the trade names the company generally used estimated royalty rates ranging from 1 to 4 of net sales if the royalty rates used to estimate the value of trade names increased decreased 100 basis points the value of the baby  parenting trade names would have increased decreased 56 million and would have resulted in 56 million more less goodwill impairment 

if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the hardware reporting unit decreased 100 basis points the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have increased 9 million however although the hardware reporting unit would still not have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2011 would have been reduced if the discount rate for the hardware reporting unit increased 100 basis points the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have declined however the goodwill impairment charge recorded during 2011 for the hardware reporting unit would not have changed since all of the hardware goodwill was included in the goodwill impairment charge 

other than the two reporting units for which goodwill impairment charges were recorded the company has no reporting units whose estimated fair values at july 1 2011 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets 

the companys indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 3205 million as of july 1 2011 the company assesses the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model using the relieffromroyalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2011 and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 6 million relating to a trade name in the baby  parenting reporting unit 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2011 was not required during 2011 

the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 24 billion  as of december 31 2011 after the completion of its annual impairment testing five of the companys 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 74 percent of the companys total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows rubbermaid commercial products industrial products  services everyday writing markers highlighters art  office organization and technology the company also had 3113 million  of indefinitelived intangible assets as of december 31 2011 the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the companys market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the companys management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software the company capitalized 703 million of software costs during 2011 which primarily relate to employee consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap at the companys décor gbu and the european region capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were  2613 million  at december 31 2011 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2011 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from three to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the companys strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts 

the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the companys product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 397 million  as of december 31 2011 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the companys cost estimates or reserve nor do the companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2011 ranged between 216 million  and 256 million  as of december 31 2011 the company had a reserve of 219 million  for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the companys income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the companys ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the companys effective tax rate as well as impact operating results see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

 41 

with bond coupons and maturities 

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the companys pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the companys pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011  in millions  



the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  



the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 53 to determine the expenses for 2011 for the pension and postretirement plans the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 73 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2011 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



the total projected benefit obligations of the companys pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2011 were 159 billion and 1652 million  respectively the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 46 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2011 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  



  

the company has 5013 million  aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses  7748 million  pretax included as a reduction to stockholders equity at december 31 2011 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled 205 million pretax in 2011 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—footnote 1—description of business and significant accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

international operations 

for 2011 2010 and 2009 the companys nonus businesses accounted for approximately 33  32  and 31  of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentages  



the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings as of december 31 2011 the companys venezuelan subsidiary had 432 million  of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes and as a result a 5 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would decrease increase the companys pretax income by 22 million 

in may 2010 the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its foreign currency exchange control regulations to close down the parallel exchange market in early june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar the company began applying the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar in may 2010 the transition to the sitme rate from the parallel rate did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated net sales or operating income for 2010 compared to using the parallel rate for the same period the transition to the sitme rate did result in a onetime foreign exchange gain of 56 million which is recognized in other income in 2010 since the introduction of sitme in june 2010 the venezuelan government has held the rate constant at 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar however future changes in the rate are possible and such changes could materially impact the companys net income primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses that would result from the change in the rate 

prior to the use of the sitme rate the companys results in venezuela in 2010 were being reflected in the consolidated financial statements at the parallel exchange rate and during substantially all of 2009 the company used the official rate of 215 to 1 us dollar to report the results of its venezuelan operations as a result of using the less favorable sitme rate and parallel rate during 2010 consolidated net sales and operating income declined 1 and 3 respectively for 2010 compared to 2009 due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate the results of the companys venezuelan operations the change in the rate does not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the companys market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 the companys assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund investments included in other assets and derivative instruments primarily included in prepaid expenses and other other assets and other accrued liabilities and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the companys derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy level 2 fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable marketbased information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 823 of the company’s 218 billion  of total debt as of december 31 2011 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 

the company also realizes gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk the company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans with forward contracts and crosscurrency hedges gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 as follows in millions

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the one day valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

  



  

 the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

foreign operations 

information regarding the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein information regarding risks relating to the company’s foreign operations is set forth in part i item 1a of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 

the company’s office products segment has operations in venezuela and the primary currency used by the venezuelan operations to transact business is the venezuelan bolivar effective january 1 2010 venezuela’s economy was characterized as highly inflationary because its threeyear cumulative inflation exceeded 100 the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings during the year ended december 31 2010 the company recognized 56 million of foreign exchange gains associated with its operations in venezuela and such amount is included in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations as of december 31 2010 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had approximately 295 million of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes and a 5 increasedecrease in the applicable exchange rate would decreaseincrease the company’s pretax income by 15 million 

during substantially all of 2009 the company used the official rate of 215 to 1 us dollar to report the results of its venezuelan operations and during 2010 the venezuelan operations’ results were reflected at the parallel exchange rate or the sitme rate which is a regulated foreign currency exchange system that began in june 2010 both of which were less favorable than the official rate used for substantially all of 2009 as a result of the use of the less favorable rate in 2010 net sales and operating income declined approximately 1 and 3 respectively for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate the results of the company’s venezuelan operations the change in the rate does not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency 

raw materials and sourced finished goods 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate and metals including steel stainless steel zinc aluminum and gold the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities over the longterm the company has experienced inflation in raw material prices and the company expects continued inflation pressures in 2011 the company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through rationalizing and exiting product lines on an annualized basis commodities consumed as raw materials generally represent approximately 10 to 15 of annual cost of products sold with no single type of commodity representing more than 10 of cost of products sold 

the company is also placing increasing reliance on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods in a limited number of cases such manufacturers supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line in particular the home  family segment’s baby  parenting gbu relies on a thirdparty manufacturer for substantially all of certain of its products 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

sales of the company’s products tend to be seasonal with sales and operating income in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter historically the company has earned more than 60 of its annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year the seasonality of the company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation amortization rent personnel costs and interest expense impacts the company’s results on a quarterly basis in addition the company has historically generated more than 65 of its operating cash flow in the second half of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results the timing of annual performancebased compensation payments and credit terms provided to customers

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to lowcost suppliers and lowercost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores and contract stationers the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 12 of net sales in 2010 across substantially all gbus the company’s top ten customers in 2010 included  in alphabetical order  bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot officemax staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart

 item 1a risk factors tableend the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging economic conditions in the us and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers a failure by one of the company’s large retail customers would adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation the intense competition in the retail sector combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of retailers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future as a result of these factors the company may experience a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s longterm success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer and other customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to continue to increase 

  

its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene and polypropylene corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process also as part of its strategy to achieve best total cost the company increasingly relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and price increases and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and streamline operations may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building the company completed project acceleration in 2010 and the primary objective of project acceleration was to reduce manufacturing overhead and streamline the supply chain to achieve best cost in addition the company continuously explores ways and initiates projects such as the european transformation plan to best leverage its functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain management and finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company runs the risk that the european transformation plan and other corporate initiatives aimed at streamlining operations and processes cost reduction and improving overall financial results may not be completed substantially as planned or may be more costly to implement than expected in addition these initiatives as well as project acceleration may not have the positive effects anticipated it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the company’s implementation of sap or other programs could adversely affect the company’s future results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth could be adversely impacted 

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and access to credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital 

circumstances associated with divestitures could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture 

• the disruption of the company’s business and 

• the potential loss of key employees 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business 

  

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business and the company’s strategy emphasizes international growth in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls labor inflation interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 1 2010 and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of the net assets excluding nonmonetary assets of subsidiaries operating in venezuela into us dollars are recorded in earnings see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company is placing increasing reliance on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis however in limited cases where the company has supply contracts with fixed prices the company may be required to purchase raw materials at abovemarket prices which could adversely impact gross margins in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand 

complications in connection with the company’s current information system initiative may adversely impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap to date the north american operations of 12 of the company’s 13 gbus have successfully gone live with their sap implementation efforts these golives are the first major milestones in a multiyear implementation that will occur in several phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the company’s customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the manner in which the company takes orders procures materials schedules production remits billings makes payments and performs other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions all of these risks could adversely impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation including patent infringement litigation involving endicia a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

the company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability could require the company to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting 

  

period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations lastly as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

actions by the company’s counterparty to the accelerated stock buyback may affect the market for the company’s common stock 

in connection with the company’s accelerated stock buyback the company expects that its counterparty will purchase shares or otherwise acquire long positions in shares  of company common stock in the open market until it has acquired or otherwise has long positions in the number of shares the company will receive under the accelerated stock buyback contract we expect that these acquisitions and other transactions will include covering purchases to close out stock borrow positions taken on by the counterparty to make its initial deliveries of shares to the company in addition we expect that the counterparty may be purchasing or selling or both purchasing and selling and possibly taking on other long andor short positions in company common stock in other hedging transactions related to the accelerated stock buyback all of these market transactions in the company’s shares or in derivative or other transactions related to company shares would be for the counterparty’s own account although the magnitude and effect of such activities on the market price of the company’s common stock cannot be determined at this time such activities may increase or prevent a decrease in the market price of the common stock 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

if the company is unable to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing shortterm debt its borrowing costs could increase 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 3050 million of debt that it will be required to refinance or repay within the next 12 months it is possible that the company may seek to address its shortterm obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured and although the company believes that alternative arrangements will be available to refinance these obligations such arrangements could result in an increase in the company’s borrowing costs 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively standard  poor’s has a positive outlook on its rating while moody’s and fitch have a stable outlook on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investment grade could increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future 

  

financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would further limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

consolidated results of operations 

the company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of operations are important in evaluating the company’s operations the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

   

results of operations — 2010 vs 2009 

net sales for 2010 were 57592 million representing an increase of 1816 million or 33 from 55776 million for 2009 the following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2010 as compared to 2009  in millions except percentages  

 

 core sales increased 47 compared to the prior year resulting from higher volumes primarily due to increases in demand particularly internationally and restocking by customers in anticipation of future increases in consumer demand particularly in the geographic regions and channels where inventories were reduced in late 2008 and early 2009 the higher volumes were also attributable to new products launched during 2010 distribution gains and geographic expansion core sales at the company’s north american and international businesses increased approximately 36 and 79 respectively versus the prior year last year’s product line exits reduced yearoveryear sales by 14 while foreign currency had a negligible impact 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2010 was 377 or 21708 million versus 367 of net sales or 20495 million for 2009 the primary drivers of the 100 basis point gross margin improvement were productivity gains from several initiatives including project acceleration and improved product mix partially offset by input cost inflation 

sga expenses for 2010 were 254 of net sales or 14634 million versus 246 of net sales or 13746 million for 2009 with currency having a negligible impact on the yearoveryear increase approximately 30 basis points of the 80 basis point increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to restructuring related charges incurred in connection with the european transformation plan in 2010 the remaining increase was mainly due to the company’s increased spend for brand building and other strategic sga activities such as marketing initiatives advertising and promotions sales force increases and the implementation of sap 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 775 million and 1000 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in restructuring costs is largely attributable to lower costs associated with reducing the company’s manufacturing and distribution footprint as the company completed project acceleration in 2010 in addition the company incurred lower restructuring costs associated with restructuring programs focused on streamlining the organizational structure to reduce structural sga costs the restructuring costs for 2010 included 60 million of facility and other exit costs 536 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 179 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs the restructuring costs for 2009 included 324 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 488 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 188 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

operating income for 2010 was 109 of net sales or 6299 million versus 103 of net sales or 5749 million for 2009 the 60 basis point improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to productivity gains and improved product mix combined with lower restructuring costs and better leverage of structural sga as a result of increased sales partially offset by increased spend for brand building and other strategic sga activities and input cost inflation 

net nonoperating expenses for 2010 increased 1829 million to 3296 million compared to 1467 million for 2009 during 2010 the company executed a series of transactions under its capital structure optimization plan under which losses related to extinguishments of debt of 2186 million were recognized see footnote 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information the increase in net nonoperating expenses attributable to the losses associated with the capital structure optimization plan was partially offset by a 216 million decline in interest expense due to lower outstanding debt levels and lower interest rates in addition the company recognized a foreign exchange gain of 56 million during 2010 associated with the company’s transition to the sitme rate for remeasuring the company’s venezuelan assets and liabilities denominated in bolivar fuerte see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company recognized income tax expense of 75 million in 2010 compared to 1427 million in 2009 representing effective rates of 25 and 333 respectively in 2010 the company entered into a binding closing agreement related to its 2005 and 2006 us federal income tax examination including all issues that were at the irs appeals office which resulted in a significant reduction to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of 636 million including penalties and interest in addition the company’s pretax income was 1279 million lower in 2010 primarily due to charges associated with the capital structure optimization plan and the charges were deductible at a higher rate than the company’s overall tax rate as a result of the charges associated with the capital structure optimization plan the company recognized lower income tax expense and a lower effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

results of operations — 2009 vs 2008 

net sales for 2009 were 55776 million representing a decrease of 8930 million or 138 from 64706 million for 2008 the following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2009 as compared to 2008  in millions except percentages  

 

 core sales declined 73 compared to the prior year resulting from lower consumer foot traffic and lower product demand as well as inventory destocking at the retail level and in the commercial and industrial channels geographically core sales of the company’s north american and international businesses declined approximately 6 and 11 respectively versus the prior year planned product line exits and foreign currency contributed an additional 52 and 21 to the yearoveryear sales decline respectively the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions increased sales 08 over the prior year 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2009 was 367 or 20495 million versus 328 of net sales or 21232 million for 2008 the primary drivers of the 390 basis point gross margin expansion included benefits realized from product line exits and rationalizations moderating input costs compared to 2008 and pricing actions initiated late in 2008 and early 2009 these improvements more than offset the adverse impacts of reduced production volumes in the company’s manufacturing facilities and unfavorable product and customer mix 

sga expenses for 2009 were 246 of net sales or 13746 million versus 232 of net sales or 15027 million for 2008 the 1281 million decrease was primarily driven by the company’s continued management of sga spending as well as cost reduction programs initiated during late 2008 and early 2009 to mitigate the negative impact of the decline in sales foreign currency translation represented 378 million of the 1281 million decline which was partially offset by 212 million of incremental sga costs resulting from the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 1000 million and 1203 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively the company’s restructuring costs in 2009 related primarily to optimizing the cost structure of the business and secondarily to reducing the company’s manufacturing footprint whereas the restructuring costs in 2008 primarily related to product line exits and rationalizations and reducing the company’s manufacturing footprint the restructuring costs for 2009 included 324 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 488 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 188 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs the restructuring costs for 2008 included 461 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 575 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 167 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the adverse impact of the macroeconomic environment on the company during the fourth quarter of 2008 particularly the rapid decrease in consumer demand combined with the updated outlook for certain of the company’s reporting units led the company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december 31 2008 as a result of this evaluation the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 2994 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the tools hardware  commercial products and office products segments no similar impairment charges were recorded in 2009 

operating income for 2009 was 103 of net sales or 5749 million versus 31 of net sales or 2008 million for 2008 the 720 basis point improvement primarily relates to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008 with no similar impairment charges in 2009 the improvement also reflects the favorable impacts of product line exits and rationalizations and moderating input costs in 2009 partially offset by an increase in sga costs as a percentage of sales 

net nonoperating expenses for 2009 decreased 503 million to 1467 million compared to 1970 million for 2008 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 522 million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to the company’s redemption of its 2500 million of mediumterm reset notes in july 2008 interest expense net for 2009 was 1400 million compared to 1379 million for 2008 the 21 million increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt outstanding yearoveryear 

the company recognized income tax expense of 1427 million in 2009 compared to 536 million in 2008 the increase in tax expense was primarily a result of an increase in income before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the recognition of income tax benefits of 31 million and 299 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively related to favorable outcomes from the irs’s review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired the impacts of these items were partially offset by the tax impacts of the impairment charges recorded in 2008 because substantially all of the impairment 

  

charges were not deductible for tax purposes and accordingly only nominal tax benefits were recognized in 2008 associated with the impairment charges see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

net sales for 2009 were 15257 million a decrease of 2993 million or 164 from 18250 million for 2008 core sales declined 158 as sales volumes were negatively impacted by inventory management by retail commercial and industrial customers continued softness in the residential construction market both domestically and internationally and sustained weakness in industrial and commercial channels unfavorable foreign currency contributed an additional 20 decline and the technical concepts acquisition increased sales 262 million or 14 versus the prior year 

operating income for 2009 was 2456 million or 161 of net sales a decrease of 261 million or 96 from 2717 million or 149 of net sales for 2008 the 120 basis point expansion in operating margin was primarily driven by the moderation of input costs compared to the prior year and improved product mix which combined contributed 190 basis points to the expansion as well as productivity gains all of which were partially offset by the adverse impacts of lower production volumes the lower production volumes were primarily the result of aggressive management of inventory levels by the company’s customers and lower sales resulting from weak demand in constant currency sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008

borrowing arrangements 

the company’s revolver expires in november 2012 in lieu of borrowings under the revolver the company may use the borrowing capacity under the revolver to provide the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper accordingly commercial paper may be issued only up to the amount available for borrowing under the revolver however the company’s current shortterm debt credit ratings and access to the credit markets may limit the company’s ability to use the full 6650 million of borrowing capacity under the revolver to issue commercial paper the revolver also provides for the issuance of up to 1000 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the revolver as of december 31 2010 there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the revolver and 6310 million of borrowing capacity was available under the revolver 

the company’s 364day receivables financing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to 2000 million and matures in september 2011 as of december 31 2010 aggregate borrowings of 1000 million were outstanding under the facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 126 and the remaining 1000 million was available for borrowing 

  

the following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the company’s shortterm borrowing arrangements during the years ended december 31  in millions  

 

 the indentures governing the company’s mediumterm and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants the company’s borrowing arrangements other than the mediumterm and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum debttototalcapitalization ratios as defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods generally maximum debttototalcapitalization is calculated as the sum of shortterm and longterm debt excluding the junior convertible subordinated debentures divided by the sum of i total debt ii total stockholders’ equity and iii 5500 million as of december 31 2010 the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the revolver and the receivables facility and utilize the 7310 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debttototalcapitalization limits in its financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the revolver and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

debt 

the company has varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business the volume and timing of production impacts the company’s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through shortterm financing arrangements such as commercial paper or borrowings under the revolver or receivables facility 

as of december 31 2010 the current portion of longterm debt and shortterm debt totaled 3050 million including the 1500 million remaining principal amount of the term loan due in september 2011 1000 million of borrowings under the receivables facility 340 million of commercial paper and 175 million of convertible notes that remained outstanding as of december 31 2010 the company plans to refinance or repay these amounts as they come due using cash flows from operations 

on august 2 2010 the company announced a capital structure optimization plan the “plan” which was substantially complete as of december 31 2010 pending the settlement of the company’s accelerated stock buyback expected in march 2011 the plan included the issuance of 5500 million of 470 senior notes due 2020 the company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes cash on hand and shortterm borrowings to fund the repurchase of 5000 million of shares of its common stock through an accelerated stock buyback program complete a cash tender offer for 2793 million of the 3000 million principal amount of outstanding 1060 notes due 2019 and complete the exchange of 377 million shares of common stock and 520 million of cash for 3247 million of the 3450 million principal amount of outstanding convertible notes the company also settled for 711 million cash the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which were entered into concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes 

by executing the series of transactions under the plan the company effectively refinanced approximately 5500 million in longterm debt at lower interest rates which is expected to generate nearly 350 million of annual interest savings based on effective interest rates on the extinguished convertible notes and certain mediumterm notes of approximately 110 compared to the interest rate on the new debt of 47 as of december 31 2010 the company had increased its outstanding common stock by 119 million shares net and expects the final net increase to be between 90 and 100 million shares the final number of shares is subject to change based upon the final settlement of the accelerated stock buyback program which is scheduled for march 2011 lastly the company substantially eliminated the potential for future share count dilution resulting from the convertible notes and related hedge transactions 

total debt was 24 billion and 25 billion as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively total debt decreased 1399 million primarily due to repayments of 3051 million for the company’s term loan and certain mediumterm notes partially offset by aggregate borrowings of 1340 million under the revolver and the receivables financing facility as of december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 when no amounts were outstanding under either arrangement the december 31 2010 debt balance was also affected by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixedrate debt in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of debt by 239 million at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 

  

the following table presents the average outstanding debt and weightedaverage interest rates for the year ended december 31  dollars in millions  

 

 reset notes 

in july 1998 the company issued 2500 million of mediumterm notes maturing in july 2028 with interest payable semiannually the “reset notes” the reset notes contained a coupon rate reset feature occurring at two tenyear intervals july 2008 and july 2018 the reset notes contained a coupon rate of 635 through the first interest reset date of july 2008 in addition the reset notes contained an embedded remarketing option pursuant to which a third party could call the reset notes at par at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval and the third party or another securities dealer could remarket the reset notes at a reset coupon rate which would result in the third party realizing proceeds for the remarketed notes in an amount approximately equal to the discounted present value of a 2500 million tenyear note with a coupon of 5485 discounted at the tenyear treasury note yield to maturity prevailing at the time of remarketing in the event the remarketing option at the end of each remarketing interval was not exercised the reset note holders were required to put the reset notes back to the company at a price of par 

the embedded remarketing option was accounted for separately as it was deemed a purchase by the company of a transferable freestanding call option from the reset note investors and the company’s concurrent transfer of the freestanding call option to the third party as a result the remarketing option which provided for the call and remarketing of the reset notes was in effect a contract between the third party and the reset note holders that allowed the third party to call the reset notes from the holders at par at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval and remarket the reset notes the fair value of the remarketing option purchased by the company from the reset note investors at the date of issuance was determined based on the amount the third party paid the company for the remarketing option in summary at issuance the company was cash neutral with respect to the remarketing option but implicitly issued the reset notes at a premium because the investors purchased the reset notes from the company simultaneous with the company purchasing the remarketing option from the investors which the company concurrently monetized by selling it to a third party as a result the reset notes carried a premium at issuance and the company recognized no gain or loss upon issuance of the reset notes 

in connection with the issuance of the reset notes in july 1998 the company entered into an agreement with the third party that afforded the company the right to purchase the remarketing option from the third party at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval at its then fair value in order to avoid the remarketing of the reset notes the company exercised this right in july 2008 to avoid the third party calling and remarketing the reset notes the company redeemed the 2500 million of reset notes in july 2008 because prevailing interest rates as of the july 2008 remarketing date would have resulted in the third party exercising the remarketing option and calling the reset notes at par and the reset notes subsequently being remarketed the reset notes would have been remarketed at a premium to par in order for the third party to realize the discounted present value described above in the remarketing a note priced at a premium to par would carry a coupon rate greater than the rate carried by a security priced at par accordingly the coupon rate arising from a potential remarketing was estimated to approximate 90 exceeding the company’s then incremental borrowing rate of 625 for comparable debt to achieve a lower net cost of borrowing in july 2008 the company redeemed the reset notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of the reset notes of 522 million associated with the purchase of the embedded remarketing option from the third party 

the company did not have any reset notes outstanding as of december 31 2010 and 2009 

pension obligations 

the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets in 2009 and 2010 the company made voluntary cash contributions of 750 million and 500 million respectively to its primary us defined benefit pension plan in order to improve the overall funded status of the plan the company expects to contribute approximately 500 million to its worldwide pension and other postretirement plans in 2011 based on minimum contribution requirements 

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 

  

dividends 

the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 005 per share for the year ended december 31 2010 

the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the company’s board of directors and will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition earnings legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies the company’s current senior and shortterm debt credit ratings from three credit rating agencies are listed below 

 

 changes in the company’s operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies and changes in the ratings may impact the rate of interest payable on certain of the company’s indebtedness the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating refer to item 1a risk factors for a more detailed discussion of the company’s credit ratings 

outlook 

for the year ending december 31 2011 the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of more than 550 million after restructuring and restructuringrelated cash payments of 90 to 100 million the company plans to fund capital expenditures of 180 to 200 million which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap in europe 

overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operations access to capital markets and availability under the revolver and receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses the company plans to use available cash borrowing capacity and cash flows from future operations to repay debt maturities as they come due including 1500 million principal payment due under the term loan in september 2011 and shortterm debt of 1350 million which includes borrowings under the receivables facility and commercial paper 

resolution of income tax contingencies 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 the company recorded 793 million 31 million and 299 million respectively in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2010 2009 and 2008 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2010 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 

  

the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the company’s cash flow in the indicated period in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2010 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under continual audit by the irs and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1131 million in unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at december 31 2010 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2010 the company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of 5767 million see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 616 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2010 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a casebycase basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 184 million 570 million and 790 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and are included in cost of products sold if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company performs its impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units which are referred to as the company’s global business units “gbu” are one level below the operating segment level the gbu is the company’s core organizing concept and each gbu supports one or more of the company’s key brands worldwide the company has not had any material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since january 1 2009 due to restructuring activities or otherwise acquired businesses if any including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the company’s existing reporting units 

the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 27 billion as of july 1 2010 five of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 70 percent of the company’s total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows baby  parenting rubbermaid commercial products industrial products  services markers highlighters art  office organization and technology 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the company’s reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired the company determined that no interim tests of impairment were necessary during 2010 due to declining macroeconomic conditions significant reductions in reporting units’ expected sales and profitability or otherwise 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing can impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the company’s reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess their fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to 

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used for the reporting units relative to the company’s market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the company’s market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for recent transactions ranged from 8 to 10 for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2010 for the july 1 2010 impairment test the company adjusted the ebitda multiples from the observed multiples generally to multiples ranging from 6 to 12 so that the aggregate value of all reporting units relative to the company’s total market value resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting unit’s market position brand awareness gross and operating margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the company’s equity market value at july 1 2010 of approximately 41 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders’ equity of approximately 19 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2010 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 05 from the 6 to 12 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value two of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2010 baby  parenting and hardware because these reporting units are executing significant restructuring projects the financial results are significantly impacted by economic cycles andor the reporting unit’s growth rate is lower than planned the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in 2010 the company generally used average compound longterm sales growth rates ranging from 2 to 3 average operating margins of approximately 10 and discount rates of 12 to 14 the company concluded these two reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

if the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the baby  parenting and hardware reporting units increased 100 basis points the estimated fair values of the reporting units would have declined by 70 million and 18 million respectively if the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points the hardware reporting unit would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test whereas the baby  parenting reporting unit would not have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company had one reporting unit baby  parenting whose estimated fair value at july 1 2010 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets using the adjusted ebitda multiple or discounted cash flow approach as applicable the estimated fair value of baby  parenting at july 1 2010 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets using the discounted cash flow approach the baby  parenting reporting unit has goodwill of 4251 million as of july 1 2010 if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the baby  parenting reporting unit was increased by 100 basis points the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been approximately 7 less than the net assets of the reporting unit additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether baby  parenting’s goodwill was impaired and to the extent goodwill was impaired the magnitude of the impairment charge 

the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of baby  parenting the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and improve its financial performance to the extent the company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with baby  parenting in future periods baby  parenting has been adversely affected by the us and japanese economy and continues to integrate two acquired international businesses baby  parenting has undertaken and is executing restructuring projects to reduce supply chain costs and administrative overhead worldwide and has taken steps to minimize the impact inflation has on its operating results and to reduce inventories these efforts are being taken to reduce the working capital investment required in the shortterm and improve profitability over the mid to longterm 

  

if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment if any based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets such as trade names and customer relationships and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit’s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets the estimated values of the reporting unit’s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit’s total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 3156 million as of july 1 2010 the company assesses the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2010 and concluded none of the assets were impaired 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2010 is not required 

see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders’ equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in impairment charges in the future if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software capitalized software costs were 2164 million at december 31 2010 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2010 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from three to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a 

  

discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 423 million as of december 31 2010 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” and other matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2010 ranged between 172 million and 296 million as of december 31 2010 the company had a reserve of 193 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

 

  

   

  

  

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010  in millions  

 

 the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  

 

 the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 57 and 58 to determine the expenses for 2010 for the pension and postretirement plans respectively the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 74 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2010 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

 the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2010 were 145 billion and 1665 million respectively the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 53 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2010 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

   

the company has 4254 million aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses 6625 million pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2010 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled 131 million pretax in 2010 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

new accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and clarified existing disclosure requirements more specifically this update requires a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers and b information about purchases sales issuances and settlements to be presented separately on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 inputs this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level 2 and level 3 inputs the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure were effective beginning january 1 2010 except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases sales issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level 3 fair value measurements which are effective for the company on january 1 2011 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

international operations 

for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 31 30 and 31 of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentages  

 

 the company began accounting for its venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 under highly inflationary accounting the company remeasures assets liabilities sales and expenses denominated in bolivar fuertes into us dollars using the applicable exchange rate and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings as of december 31 2010 the company’s venezuelan subsidiary had approximately 295 million of net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes and as a result a 5 increase decrease in the applicable exchange rate would decrease increase the company’s pretax income by 15 million 

in may 2010 the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its foreign currency exchange control regulations to close down the parallel exchange market in early june 2010 the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” foreign currency exchange through sitme is allowed within a specified band of 45 to 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar but most of the exchanges have been executed at the rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar the company began applying the sitme rate of 53 bolivar fuerte to us dollar in may 2010 the transition to the sitme rate from the parallel rate did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated net sales or operating income for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to using the parallel rate for the same period the transition to the sitme rate did result in a onetime foreign exchange gain of 56 million which is recognized in other income for the year ended december 31 2010 

prior to the use of the sitme rate the company’s results in venezuela in 2010 were being reflected in the consolidated financial statements at the parallel exchange rate and during substantially all of 2009 the company used the official rate of 215 to 1 us dollar to report the results of its venezuelan operations as a result of using the less favorable sitme rate and parallel rate during 2010 consolidated net sales and operating income declined 1 and 3 respectively for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate the results of the company’s venezuelan operations the change in the rate does not impact reported changes in core sales which exclude the impact of foreign currency since the introduction of sitme in june 2010 the venezuelan government has held the rate constant at 53 

  

bolivar fuerte to us dollar however future changes in the rate are possible and such changes could materially impact the company’s net income primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses that would result from the change in the rate 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 

  

  

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund investments included in other assets and derivative instruments primarily included in other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy level 2 fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable marketbased information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 437 of the company’s 237 billion of total debt as of december 31 2010 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 

the company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk the company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans with forward contracts and crosscurrency hedges gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 as follows in millions  

 

 see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

  

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the one day valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

  

 the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

strategic initiatives 

optimize the portfolio 

the company continues to optimize its portfolio by reducing its exposure to nonstrategic businesses and product lines thereby enhancing the growth opportunities and profitability of the overall portfolio the company seeks to build a portfolio of businesses that satisfy several key strategic criteria including consumermeaningful brands product categories that respond to innovation and product differentiation strong margin and growth potential global categories favorable customer and channel dynamics valued intellectual property and synergies with the company’s core product categories and competencies 

using the above criteria the company routinely reviews its businesses and product offerings to assess their strategic fit the company has reduced its exposure to nonstrategic product categories by rationalizing and exiting the lowmargin lowvalueadd areas of the business which primarily include products where input costs are a higher percentage of the cost of the product and where the consumer’s willingness to pay for innovation is low the company’s strategic focus is on building strong consumermeaningful brands and the nonstrategic product categories are generally commoditized and are less responsive to brand investment and product innovation over the past several years the company has substantially exited the portion of the portfolio that falls into the commoditized category including the rationalization and exit of certain resinintensive commoditized product categories in 2009 the recent portfolio optimization activities resulted in net sales being more than 300 million less in 2009 compared to 2008 exiting nonstrategic and commoditized product categories has allowed the company to focus on its portfolio of brands that matter™

foreign operations 

information regarding the company’s 2009 2008 and 2007 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein information regarding risks relating to the company’s foreign operations is set forth in part i item 1a of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 

the company’s office products segment has operations in venezuela and the primary currency used by the venezuelan operations to transact business is the venezuelan bolivar through december 1 2009 the company used the official exchange rate in venezuela to translate its venezuelan operations’ financial statements into us dollars and using the official exchange rate the venezuelan operations generated net sales of approximately 65 million and operating income of approximately 25 million in 2009 based on the challenges the company has faced in repatriating venezuelan earnings to the us and other facts and circumstances the company adopted the parallel rate to translate its venezuelan financial statements into us dollars effective december 1 2009 in december 2009 the parallel exchange rate of venezuelan bolivars to us dollars was approximately three times the official rate due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate venezuelan bolivar financial statements in december 2009 i net assets including cash declined approximately 30 million during the quarter ended december 31 2009 and ii the company’s 2010 sales and operating income are anticipated to decline an estimated 1 and 3 respectively compared to the year ended december 31 2009 due to the ongoing translation of the venezuela bolivar at the parallel rate 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela’s economy has been characterized as highly inflationary because its threeyear cumulative inflation has exceeded 100 as a result changes in the us dollar value of the company’s venezuelan bolivar net assets attributable to fluctuations in the parallel rate will be recorded as gains or losses in the statement of operations rather than in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin corrugate and metals including steel stainless steel zinc aluminum and gold the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities over the longterm the company has experienced inflation in raw material prices and the company expects inflation pressures in 2010 the company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through rationalizing and exiting product lines 

  

the company is also placing increasing reliance on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods in a limited number of cases such manufacturers supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line in particular the home  family segment’s baby  parenting essentials gbu relies on a thirdparty manufacturer for a significant portion of certain of its products 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products delivering superior customer service and consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to lowcost suppliers and lowercost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores and contract stationers the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 12 of net sales in 2009 across substantially all gbus the company’s top ten customers in 2009 included  in alphabetical order  bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot officemax staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us ww grainger and walmart

 item 1a risk factors tableend the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with continuing challenging economic conditions in the us and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations consumer demand and the condition of these sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers a failure by one of the company’s large retail customers would adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation however the intense competition in the retail sector combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of retailers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future as a result of these factors the company may experience a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

if the company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create consumer demand the company’s ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely impacted 

the company’s longterm success in the competitive retail environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products the company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful 

  

brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brandbuilding and marketing initiatives while the company plans to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brandbuilding and marketing initiatives over the long term the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin principally polyethylene and polypropylene corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process also as part of its strategy to achieve best total cost the company increasingly relies on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and streamline operations may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building project acceleration includes the anticipated closures of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities in addition the company continuously explores ways to best leverage its functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain management and finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company runs the risk that project acceleration and other corporate initiatives aimed at streamlining operations and processes cost reduction and improving overall financial results may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required after such projects are completed in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of project acceleration or other programs could adversely affect the company’s future results 

if the company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses the company’s future growth could be adversely impacted 

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the company’s financial position and uncertainty in global credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital 

circumstances associated with the company’s potential divestitures and product line rationalizations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business or product line based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product line may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the assumption of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture 

• the disruption of the company’s business 

• and the potential loss of key employees 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or product line 

  

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

international operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in asia it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

venezuelan government approval for currency conversion into us dollars has recently been delayed resulting in higher cash balances within the company’s venezuelan subsidiary which totaled 17 million at the parallel exchange rate as of december 31 2009 44 million at the official rate at september 30 2009 in addition venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 2010 and accordingly future gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the net assets of subsidiaries operating in venezuela or other highly inflationary economies into us dollars are recorded in earnings which will adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company is placing increasing reliance on thirdparty manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners instead most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand 

complications in connection with the company’s current information system initiative may adversely impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap to date the north american operations of 10 of the company’s 13 gbus have successfully gone live with their sap implementation efforts with the majority of the company’s remaining north american operations scheduled to go live in 2010 these golives are the first major milestones in a multiyear implementation that will occur in several phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the company’s customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the manner in which the company takes orders procures materials schedules production remits billings makes payments and performs other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions all of these risks could adversely impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s sales and customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation including patent infringement litigation involving endicia a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price 

the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present in early 2009 the company’s total market capitalization temporarily declined below the company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity balance if the company’s total market capitalization is below reported consolidated stockholders’ equity at a future reporting date or for a sustained period the company considers this an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill the company utilizes market capitalization in corroborating its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units as a result the company may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in additional impairment charges in the future 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

changes in laws regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the company does business this includes changes in environmental competitive and productrelated laws as well as changes in accounting standards taxation and other regulations accordingly the company’s ability to manage regulatory tax and legal matters including environmental human resource product liability patent and intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability could require the company to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period which could materially impact the company’s results in addition new regulations may be enacted in the us or abroad that may require the company to incur additional personnelrelated environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance any of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations lastly as a usbased multinational company the company is also subject to tax regulations in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions some of which are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxed in the us provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these or other tax regulations should change the company’s financial results could be impacted 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

conversion of the company’s convertible senior notes due 2014 may dilute the ownership interests of stockholders at the time of conversion and the company’s stock price may be impacted by note hedge and warrant transactions it entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 

upon conversion of some or all of the company’s convertible senior notes due 2014 the ownership interests of stockholders may be diluted any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the company’s common stock in addition the company entered into note hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing common stock upon conversion of the notes the company also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 

in connection with establishing an initial hedge for the note hedge and warrant transactions these financial institutions or their affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to the company’s common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the company’s common stock andor purchasing and selling shares of the company’s common stock any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of the company’s common stock for additional information on the convertible senior notes and related note hedge and warrant transactions please refer to footnotes 9 and 10 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

if the company is unable to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing shortterm debt its borrowing costs could increase 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 4935 million of shortterm debt that it could be required to refinance or repay within the next 12 months although the company’s capital markets transactions and financing activities in 2009 addressed a substantial portion of the company’s then outstanding shortterm debt obligations it is possible that the company may seek to address its 

  

remaining shortterm obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured particularly given uncertainties in the global credit markets and although the company believes that alternative arrangements will be available to refinance these obligations such arrangements could result in an increase in the company’s borrowing costs 

a reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively standard  poor’s has a stable outlook and moody’s and fitch maintain a negative outlook on their ratings the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant a downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investment grade would increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would further limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

consolidated results of operations 

the company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of operations are important in evaluating the company’s operations the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

 results of operations — 2009 vs 2008 

net sales for 2009 were 55776 million representing a decrease of 8930 million or 138 from 64706 million for 2008 core sales declined 73 compared to the prior year resulting from the lower consumer foot traffic and lower product demand as well as inventory destocking at the retail level and in the commercial and industrial channels geographically core sales of the company’s domestic and international businesses declined approximately 6 and 11 respectively versus the prior year planned product line exits and foreign currency contributed an additional 52 and 21 to the yearoveryear sales decline respectively the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions increased sales 08 over the prior year 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2009 was 367 or 20495 million versus 328 of net sales or 21232 million for 2008 the primary drivers of the 390 basis point gross margin expansion included benefits realized from product line exits moderating input costs compared to 2008 and pricing actions initiated late in 2008 and early 2009 these improvements more than offset the adverse impacts of reduced production volumes in the company’s manufacturing facilities and unfavorable product and customer mix 

sga expenses for 2009 were 246 of net sales or 13746 million versus 232 of net sales or 15027 million for 2008 the 1281 million decrease was primarily driven by the company’s continued management of sga spending as well as cost reduction programs initiated during late 2008 and early 2009 to mitigate the negative impact of the decline in sales foreign currency translation represented 378 million of the 1281 million decline which was partially offset by 212 million of incremental sga costs resulting from the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 1000 million and 1203 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively the company’s restructuring costs in 2009 related primarily to optimizing the cost structure of the business and secondarily to reducing the company’s manufacturing footprint whereas the restructuring costs in 2008 primarily related to product line exits and reducing the company’s manufacturing footprint the restructuring costs for 2009 included 324 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 488 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 188 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs the restructuring costs for 2008 included 461 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs 575 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 167 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

the adverse impact of the macroeconomic environment on the company during the fourth quarter of 2008 particularly the rapid decrease in consumer demand combined with the updated outlook for certain of the company’s reporting units led the company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december 31 2008 as a result of this evaluation the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 2994 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the tools hardware  commercial products and office products segments no similar impairment charges were recorded in 2009 

operating income for 2009 was 103 of net sales or 5749 million versus 31 of net sales or 2008 million for 2008 the 720 basis point improvement primarily relates to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008 with no similar impairment charges in 2009 the improvement also reflects the favorable impacts of product line exits and moderating input costs in 2009 partially offset by an increase in sga costs as a percentage of sales 

interest expense net for 2009 was 1400 million compared to 1379 million for 2008 the 21 million increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt outstanding yearoveryear 

other expense net for 2009 was 67 million versus 591 million for 2008 the decrease in other expense net is primarily attributable to the 522 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the company’s redemption of its 2500 million of mediumterm reset notes in july 2008 

the company recognized income tax expense of 1427 million in 2009 compared to 536 million in 2008 the increase in tax expense was primarily a result of an increase in income before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the recognition of income tax benefits of 31 million and 299 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively related to favorable outcomes from the irs’s review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired the impacts of these items were partially offset by the tax impacts of the impairment charges recorded in 2008 because substantially all of the impairment charges were not deductible for tax purposes and accordingly only nominal tax benefits were recognized in 2008 associated with the impairment charges see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

results of operations — 2008 vs 2007 

net sales for 2008 were 64706 million representing an increase of 633 million or 1 from 64073 million for 2007 core sales declined approximately 30 compared to the prior year the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions increased sales by 2047 million or 32 over the prior year and foreign currency contributed 08 of sales growth 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2008 was 328 or 21232 million versus 352 or 22572 million for 2007 the primary drivers of the 240 basis point gross margin contraction included the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation as well as lower manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 partially offset by benefits from productivity improvements from project acceleration and other initiatives 

sga expenses for 2008 were 232 of net sales or 15027 million versus 223 of net sales or 14309 million for 2007 the 718 million increase was primarily driven by sga expenses associated with the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency which more than offset the impacts of the company’s management of structural and strategic sga spending 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 1203 million and 860 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in restructuring costs for 2008 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to 360 million of asset impairment charges recorded in 2008 associated with the company’s plan to divest downsize or exit certain product categories where resin is the primary component of cost of products sold the 2008 restructuring costs included 461 million of facility and other exit costs including the 360 million of asset impairment charges noted above 575 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 167 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs of which 31 million relates to the company’s 2001 restructuring plan the 2007 restructuring costs included 277 million of facility and other exit costs 364 million of employee severance and termination benefits and 219 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 2994 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the tools hardware  commercial products and office products segments no similar impairment charges were recorded in 2007 

operating income for 2008 was 2008 million or 31 of net sales versus 7403 million or 116 of net sales in 2007 the 850 basis point decline is primarily attributable to the 2994 million of impairment charges noted above the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation on gross margin and the 360 million of project acceleration asset impairment charges in 2008 discussed above partially offset by improvements from productivity initiatives 

  

interest expense net for 2008 was 1379 million versus 1041 million for 2007 the 338 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by additional borrowings in 2008 used to fund the acquisitions of aprica and technical concepts 

other expense net for 2008 was 591 million versus 42 million for 2007 the increase in other expense net in 2008 is primarily attributable to the 522 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the company’s redemption of its 2500 million of mediumterm reset notes in july 2008 

the company recognized income tax expense of 536 million for 2008 compared to 1497 million for 2007 the decrease in tax expense was primarily a result of a decrease in income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 the impact of the decrease in operating income from 2007 to 2008 on income tax expense was partially offset by a decrease in the tax rates applied to the various discrete expenses including restructuring and impairment charges in 2008 compared to 2007 which had the effect of increasing income tax expense in 2008 compared to 2007 income tax expense for 2008 and 2007 was favorably impacted by the recognition of net income tax benefits of 299 million and 413 million respectively primarily related to favorable outcomes from the irs’s review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

for 2007 the company recognized a loss from operations of discontinued operations of 02 million net of tax related to the results of the remaining operations of the home décor europe business and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of 119 million net of tax related primarily to the disposal of the remaining operations of the home décor europe business

the company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity managing working capital and monitoring the company’s overall capitalization 

 

  

  

 the company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from 021 per share to 005 per share during 2009 to enhance its liquidity and to maintain its investmentgrade credit rating 

over the longterm the company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay debt maturities the company has from time to time refinanced redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet going forward depending on market conditions its cash positions and other considerations the company may continue to take such actions 

borrowing arrangements 

during 2009 the company enhanced its liquidity and financial position by completing the issuance of 3000 million of unsecured and unsubordinated notes and 3450 million of convertible senior notes proceeds from these offerings were used to complete the convertible note hedge transactions and to complete the tender offers and for general corporate purposes in addition in september 2009 the company completed a new 364day receivables facility that provides for borrowings of up to 2000 million as of december 31 2009 1888 million was available for borrowing under the new receivables facility and there were no amounts outstanding in connection with the completion of the new receivables facility the company repaid the 4480 million floatingrate note outstanding under the previous receivables facility 

the company’s revolver expires in november 2012 as of december 31 2009 there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver and the company had 6900 million of borrowing capacity in november 2010 the borrowing capacity is reduced to 6650 million in lieu of borrowings under the revolver the company may use the borrowing capacity under the revolver to provide the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper accordingly commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the revolver however the company’s current shortterm debt credit ratings coupled with continued uncertainty in the credit markets may preclude it from accessing the commercial paper market the revolver also provides for the issuance of up to 1000 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the revolver as of december 31 2009 no commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the revolver 

the indentures governing the company’s mediumterm and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants the company’s borrowing arrangements other than the mediumterm and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to total capitalization ratios as of december 31 2009 the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the revolver and the new receivables facility and utilize the 8788 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt to total capitalization limits in its financial covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the revolver and new receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

debt 

the company has varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business the volume and timing of production impacts the company’s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through shortterm financing arrangements such as borrowings under the revolver or commercial paper supported by the revolver 

  

total debt decreased 3705 million to 25 billion as of december 31 2009 from 29 billion as of december 31 2008 the net decrease was attributable to a 3250 million reduction in outstanding debt as a result of the completion of the tender offers the repayment of the 4480 million floatingrate note outstanding under the company’s previous receivables facility a 500 million repayment on the term loan as well as the repayment of the remaining 699 million principal amount outstanding of the 2500 million mediumterm notes due december 2009 these decreases were partially offset by the march 2009 issuance of 3000 million of mediumterm notes and 3450 million of convertible senior notes which have a carrying value of 2843 million at december 31 2009 the december 31 2009 debt balance was also affected by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixedrate debt in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the marktomarket adjustments decreased the carrying value of debt by 439 million in 2009 compared to 2008 

the company’s 364day receivables financing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to 2000 million of which 1888 million was available for borrowing and no amounts were outstanding at december 31 2009 the completion of the new receivables facility was coincident with the september 2009 repayment of the 4480 million floatingrate note outstanding under the company’s previous receivables facility 

in may 2009 the company completed cash tender offers to repurchase 1801 million of the 2500 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due december 2009 and 1449 million of the 2500 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due may 2010 in december 2009 the company repaid the remaining 699 million principal amount outstanding of the 2500 million mediumterm notes due december 2009 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 4935 million of shortterm debt including 1051 million of mediumterm notes that mature in may 2010 and a 1000 million principal payment due on the term loan in september 2010 in addition because the closing sale price of the company’s common stock exceeded 1119 for more than 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the three months ended december 31 2009 the convertible senior notes are convertible at the election of the holders of the notes at any time during the three months ended march 31 2010 since conversion of the notes is outside the control of the company the carrying value of the convertible senior notes 2843 million is classified as current portion of longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 

reset notes 

in july 1998 the company issued 2500 million of mediumterm notes maturing in july 2028 with interest payable semiannually the “reset notes” the reset notes contained a coupon rate reset feature occurring at two tenyear intervals july 2008 and july 2018 the reset notes contained a coupon rate of 635 through the first interest reset date of july 2008 in addition the reset notes contained an embedded remarketing option pursuant to which a third party could call the reset notes at par at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval and the third party or another securities dealer could remarket the reset notes at a reset coupon rate which would result in the third party realizing proceeds for the remarketed notes in an amount approximately equal to the discounted present value of a 2500 million tenyear note with a coupon of 5485 discounted at the tenyear treasury note yield to maturity prevailing at the time of remarketing in the event the remarketing option at the end of each remarketing interval was not exercised the reset note holders were required to put the reset notes back to the company at a price of par 

the embedded remarketing option was accounted for separately as it was deemed a purchase by the company of a transferable freestanding call option from the reset note investors and the company’s concurrent transfer of the freestanding call option to the third party as a result the remarketing option which provided for the call and remarketing of the reset notes was in effect a contract between the third party and the reset note holders that allowed the third party to call the reset notes from the holders at par at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval and remarket the reset notes the fair value of the remarketing option purchased by the company from the reset note investors at the date of issuance was determined based on the amount the third party paid the company for the remarketing option in summary at issuance the company was cash neutral with respect to the remarketing option but implicitly issued the reset notes at a premium because the investors purchased the reset notes from the company simultaneous with the company purchasing the remarketing option from the investors which the company concurrently monetized by selling it to a third party as a result the reset notes carried a premium at issuance and the company recognized no gain or loss upon issuance of the reset notes 

in connection with the issuance of the reset notes in july 1998 the company entered into an agreement with the third party that afforded the company the right to purchase the remarketing option from the third party at the end of each tenyear remarketing interval at its then fair value in order to avoid the remarketing of the reset notes the company exercised this right in july 2008 to avoid the third party calling and remarketing the reset notes the company redeemed the 2500 million of reset notes in july 2008 because prevailing interest rates as of the july 2008 remarketing date would have resulted in the third party exercising the remarketing 

  

option and calling the reset notes at par and the reset notes subsequently being remarketed the reset notes would have been remarketed at a premium to par in order for the third party to realize the discounted present value described above in the remarketing a note priced at a premium to par would carry a coupon rate greater than the rate carried by a security priced at par accordingly the coupon rate arising from a potential remarketing was estimated to approximate 90 exceeding the company’s then incremental borrowing rate of 625 for comparable debt to achieve a lower net cost of borrowing in july 2008 the company redeemed the reset notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of the reset notes of 522 million associated with the purchase of the embedded remarketing option from the third party 

the company did not have any reset notes outstanding as of december 31 2009 

pension obligations 

the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets in 2009 the company made a 750 million voluntary cash contribution to its primary us defined benefit pension plan in order to improve the overall funded status of the plan the company expects to contribute approximately 330 million to its pension plans in 2010 

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 

dividends 

in the first quarter of 2009 the company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from 021 per share to 005 per share to improve liquidity and maintain its current investmentgrade credit rating the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition earnings legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively standard  poor’s has a stable outlook and moody’s and fitch maintain a negative outlook on their ratings changes in the company’s operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating refer to item 1a risk factors for a more detailed discussion of the company’s credit ratings 

outlook 

for the year ending december 31 2010 the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of more than 5000 million after restructuring cash payments of approximately 700 million to 800 million the company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately 1600 million which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap 

overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operations access to capital markets and availability under the revolver and new receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses the company plans to use available cash to repay debt maturities as they come due including 1051 million of mediumterm notes that mature in may 2010 and a 1000 million principal payment due under the term loan in september 2010 

resolution of income tax contingencies 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 the company recorded 31 million 299 million and 413 million respectively in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the irs the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves the reversal of a valuation allowance the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in europe these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2009 2008 and 2007 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028 certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2009 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 

the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the company’s cash flow in the indicated period in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2009 additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under continual audit by the irs and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1916 million in unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at december 31 2009 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2009 the company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of 5947 million see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

as of december 31 2009 the company had 594 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company’s selfinsurance programs including workers’ compensation product liability and medical see footnote 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as of december 31 2009 the company did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other salesrelated discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a case by case basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slowmoving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions provisions for excess and obsolete inventories including shrink reserves totaled 570 million 790 million and 418 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and are included in cost of products sold if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company performs its impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level and all of the company’s goodwill is assigned to the company’s reporting units reporting units are one level below the operating segment level in connection with the company’s realignment of its businesses under a global business unit “gbu” structure the company redefined its reporting units where necessary to align with the gbu structure effective january 1 2009 reporting units in the office products segment and certain reporting units in the tools hardware  commercial products segment that were geographically aligned were impacted by the realignment the goodwill of these geographically aligned reporting units was reallocated to reporting units defined under the gbu structure on a relative fair value basis the company has not had any other material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since january 1 2006 due to restructuring activities or otherwise acquired businesses including goodwill arising from such transactions are integrated into the company’s existing reporting units 

after the realignment of the reporting units and the reallocation of goodwill the company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of 27 billion as of january 1 2009 five of the company’s 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 70 of the company’s total goodwill these five reporting units were as follows baby  parenting essentials rubbermaid commercial products industrial products  services markers highlighters art  office organization and office technology 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount for example if macroeconomic factors such as 

  

consumer demand and consumer confidence deteriorate materially such that the company’s reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired the company determined that no interim tests of impairment were necessary during 2009 due to declining macroeconomic conditions significant reductions in reporting units’ expected sales and profitability or otherwise 

in the company’s goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value impairment may be present estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing can impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the impairment charge to the extent one is recorded the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value for the company’s reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess their fair value the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company’s internal forecasting process to determine the ebitda multiple the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used for the reporting units relative to the company’s market capitalization plus an equity control premium the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the company’s market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 

the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for recent transactions ranged from 9 to 11 for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2009 for the july 1 2009 impairment test the company adjusted the ebitda multiples from the observed multiples generally to multiples ranging from 6 to 12 so that the aggregate value of all reporting units relative to the company’s total market value resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit including the reporting unit’s market position brand awareness gross and operating margins and prospects for growth among other factors after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used furthermore the company’s equity market value at july 1 2009 of approximately 30 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders’ equity of approximately 18 billion for the impairment test as of july 1 2009 if each reporting unit’s ebitda multiple were reduced by 05 from the 6 to 12 multiple used for each reporting unit all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market has experienced significant losses is in a stage of hypergrowth is executing significant restructuring efforts or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value three of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july 1 2009 industrial products  services everyday writing and fine writing because these reporting units are executing significant restructuring projects or the reporting unit’s financial results are significantly impacted by economic cycles the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit the discount rate and the working capital investment required estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates raw material costs currency fluctuations and operating efficiencies to be realized the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable riskadjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit in using the discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in 2009 the company generally used average compound longterm sales growth rates ranging from 2 to 3 average operating margins ranging from 13 to 26 and discount rates ranging from 11 to 12 the company concluded these three reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach 

if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment if any based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets such as trade names and customer relationships and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit’s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets the estimated values of the reporting unit’s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit’s total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

if the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the industrial products  services everyday writing and fine writing reporting units increased 100 basis points the estimated fair values of the reporting units would have declined by 63 million 63 million and 30 million respectively if the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points all three reporting units would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

  

the company has one reporting unit baby  parenting essentials whose estimated fair value at july 1 2009 exceeded net assets by less than 10 of the reporting unit’s net assets using the adjusted ebitda multiple or discounted cash flow value as applicable the baby  parenting essentials reporting unit has goodwill of 416 million as of july 1 2009 if the ebitda multiple used to estimate the fair value of baby  parenting essentials reporting unit were reduced by 10 the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been approximately 1 less than the net assets of the reporting unit additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether baby  parenting essentials’ goodwill was impaired and to the extent goodwill was impaired the magnitude of the impairment charge 

the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of baby  parenting essentials the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and improve its financial performance to the extent the company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with baby  parenting essentials in future periods baby  parenting essentials has been adversely impacted by recently enacted child safety legislation in north america and continues to integrate two acquired international businesses baby  parenting essentials has undertaken and is executing restructuring projects to reduce supply chain costs and administrative overhead worldwide and has taken steps to minimize the impact inflation has on its operating results and to reduce inventories these efforts are being taken to reduce the working capital investment required in the shortterm and improve profitability over the mid to longterm 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 320 million as of july 1 2009 the company assesses the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name an impairment charge for indefinitelived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of july 1 2009 and concluded none of the assets were impaired 

the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade names based on consideration of these factors the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present and therefore impairment testing as of a date other than july 1 2009 is not required 

see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders’ equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software capitalized software costs were 1859 million at december 31 2009 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2009 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software which typically ranges from three to 12 years capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

  

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 473 million as of december 31 2009 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2009 ranged between 107 million and 269 million as of december 31 2009 the company had a reserve of 155 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases as discussed below 

 

  

  

  

  

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009  in millions  

 

 the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  

 

   

the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 62 and 63 to determine the expenses for 2009 for the pension and postretirement plans respectively the company used a weightedaverage expected return on assets of 73 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2009 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

 the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2009 were 141 billion and 1681 million respectively the company used weightedaverage discount rates of 57 and 58 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans respectively as of december 31 2009 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

 the company has 4184 million aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses 6251 million pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2009 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled 73 million pretax in 2009 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance changing the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments in addition to increased disclosure this guidance eliminates the concept of qualifying special purpose entities and changes the test for consolidation of variable interest entities this guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2010 the adoption of the authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

international operations 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the company’s nonus businesses accounted for approximately 30 31 and 28 of net sales respectively see footnote 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in both us and nonus net sales are shown below for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentages  

 

 

 the company’s office products segment has operations in venezuela and the primary currency used by the venezuelan operations to transact business is the venezuelan bolivar through december 1 2009 the company used the official exchange rate in venezuela to translate its venezuelan operations’ financial statements into us dollars and using the official exchange rate the venezuelan operations generated net sales of approximately 65 million and operating income of approximately 25 million in 2009 based on 

  

the challenges the company has faced in repatriating venezuelan earnings to the us and other facts and circumstances the company adopted the parallel rate to translate its venezuelan financial statements into us dollars effective december 1 2009 in december 2009 the parallel exchange rate of venezuelan bolivars to us dollars was approximately three times the official rate due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate venezuelan bolivar financial statements in december 2009 i net assets including cash declined approximately 30 million during the quarter ended december 31 2009 and ii the company’s 2010 sales and operating income are anticipated to decline an estimated 1 and 3 respectively compared to the year ended december 31 2009 due to the translation of the venezuelan bolivar at the parallel rate 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela’s economy has been characterized as highly inflationary because threeyear cumulative inflation has exceeded 100 as a result changes in the us dollar value of the company’s venezuelan bolivar net assets attributable to fluctuations in the parallel rate will be recorded as gains or losses in the statement of operations rather than in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity 

fair value measurements 

fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value including the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 

the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 

  

  

 the company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents mutual fund investments included in other assets and derivative instruments primarily included in other assets other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level 2 and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 1 the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes and the company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy level 2 fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable market based information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floatingrate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floatingrate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixedrate debt represented approximately 450 of the company’s 251 billion of total debt as of december 31 2009 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 

the company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk the company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans with forward contracts and crosscurrency hedges gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors the company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 as follows in millions  

 

 see footnote 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

  

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the one day valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

  

 the yearoveryear decrease in the end of year valueatrisk in foreign exchange is primarily due to reduced volatility in foreign exchange rates in late 2009 as well as declines in overall currency exposures the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

“justintime” basis in order to reduce inventory carrying costs and increase returns on investment as retailers shorten their lead times for orders manufacturers need to more closely anticipate consumerbuying patterns the company supports its retail customers’ “justintime” inventory strategies through more responsive sourcing manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic communications

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

the company’s sales and operating income in the first quarter are generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced demand and volume for the products in the company’s office products and cleaning organization  décor segments in the quarter 

patents and trademarks 

the company has many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are in the aggregate important to its business the company’s most significant registered trademarks are “sharpie®” “paper mate®” “dymo®” “irwin®” “lenox®” “rubbermaid®” “tc®” “levolor®” “graco®” “aprica®” and “calphalon®” 

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the 

  

combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products delivering superior customer service including innovative “goodbetterbest” marketing and merchandising programs consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores and contract stationers the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 13 of net sales in 2008 across substantially all business units the company’s top ten customers in 2008 included  in alphabetical order  bed bath  beyond lowe’s office depot officemax staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us w w grainger and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions with the recent and significant deterioration of economic conditions in the us and elsewhere there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company’s products as well as its financial condition and results of operations consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry may also be impacted by other external factors such as war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact the company’s business moreover in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers a failure by one of the company’s large retail customers would adversely impact the company’s sales and operating cash flows 

  

if the company is unable to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing shortterm debt its borrowing costs could increase significantly 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 7610 million of shortterm debt that it will be required to refinance or repay within the next twelve months the company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured particularly given the recent turmoil and uncertainty in the global credit markets and although the company believes that alternative arrangements will be available to refinance these obligations such arrangements could result in a significant increase in the company’s borrowing costs 

a further reduction in the company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively in july 2008 both moody’s and standard  poor’s changed their outlook on their ratings from stable to negative and fitch revised its outlook from positive to stable in february 2009 moody’s and standard  poor’s lowered their credit ratings on the company’s senior debt from baa2 to baa3 and from bbb to bbb respectively and their shortterm debt credit ratings from p2 to p3 and from a2 to a3 respectively both moody’s and standard  poor’s reaffirmed their negative outlook the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant any further downgrade by moody’s or standard  poor’s which would reduce the company’s senior debt below investment grade would likely increase the company’s borrowing costs which would adversely affect the company’s financial results the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease if the company’s shortterm ratings were to be lowered it would further limit or eliminate entirely the company’s access to the commercial paper market the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the company’s securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and well established the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation however the intense competition in the retail sector combined with the overall economic environment may result in a number of retailers experiencing financial difficulty or failing in the future as a result of these factors the company may experience a loss of sales reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

the company’s inability to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create consumer demand may adversely impact its ability to compete in the marketplace 

the company’s longterm success in the competitive retail environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products the company’s strategy includes increased investment in new product development and increased focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

  

if the company does not continue to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands its operating results may suffer 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives while the company plans to increase its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing initiatives the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

the company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation 

the company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolioholding company that grew through acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation such a transformation requires significant investment in brandbuilding marketing and product development it also requires the development of the right methods for understanding how consumers interact with the company’s brands and categories and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending although the process is well underway significant challenges and uncertainties remain 

price increases in raw materials and sourced products could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases raw materials including resin glass corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process also as part of its strategy to achieve best total cost the company increasingly relies on third party manufacturers as a source for its products these manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures which may in turn result in an increase in the amount the company pays for sourced products raw material and sourced product price increases may more than offset the company’s productivity gains and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s plans to improve productivity and streamline operations may not be successful which would adversely affect its ability to compete 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building project acceleration includes the anticipated closures of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities in addition the company continuously explores ways to best leverage its functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain management and finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company runs the risk that project acceleration and other corporate initiatives aimed at streamlining operations and processes cost reduction and improving overall financial results may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated it is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required after such projects are completed in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of project acceleration could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company’s inability to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses could adversely impact the company’s future growth 

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth furthermore the company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the recent turmoil and uncertainty in global credit markets in addition significant additional borrowings would increase the company’s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the company’s future access to capital 

  

circumstances associated with the company’s potential divestitures and product line rationalizations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and products and may decide to sell or discontinue a business or product line based on such an evaluation a decision to divest or discontinue a business or product line may result in asset impairments including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets and losses upon disposition both of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or prospective buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks including the following 

• difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the assumption of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture 

• the disruption of the company’s business 

• and the potential loss of key employees 

the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or product line 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

foreign operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in the far east it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

the inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect the company’s ability to manufacture and market its products 

the company purchases raw materials to be used in manufacturing its products in addition the company is placing increasing reliance on third party manufacturers as a source for finished goods the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its suppliers or sourcing partners instead most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis in addition in some instances the company maintains singlesource or limitedsource sourcing relationships either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations financial operating or other difficulties encountered by the company’s suppliers andor sourcing partners or changes in the company’s relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions delays and inefficiencies and prevent the company from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand 

complications in connection with the company’s current information system initiative may adversely impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap to date the company has successfully gone live with the sap implementation at its north american office products business units and its north american home  family business units these golives are the first two major milestones in a multiyear implementation that will occur in several phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the company’s customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools the company uses to take orders procure materials schedule production remit billings make payments and perform other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could 

  

impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions all of these risks could adversely impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation including patent infringement litigation involving psi systems inc a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in the company’s stock price given the macroeconomic environment and its adverse impact on certain business units of the company in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company evaluated its goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the evaluation the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 2994 million principally related to goodwill 

the company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present subsequent to december 31 2008 the company’s total market capitalization periodically declined below the company’s december 31 2008 consolidated stockholders’ equity balance if the company’s total market capitalization is below reported consolidated stockholders’ equity at a future reporting date or for a sustained period the company considers this an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill the company utilizes market capitalization in corroborating its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units as a result the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in additional impairment charges in the future 

the resolution of the company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact the company’s cash flows and results of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us significant estimation and judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace adversely impact the value of its enduser brands or result in an increase in the cost of producing the company’s products the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect the company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for the company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations the company could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore the company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity 

  

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by the company in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets or health care costs the company’s future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that the company uses may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on the company’s pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements

 market overview 

the company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the company operates during 2008 the company’s results were impacted by the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions significant inflation a volatile currency environment instability in the credit markets and disruption of global equity markets these factors combined with rising unemployment levels and the contraction of consumer credit markets adversely impacted consumer confidence leading to reductions in consumer spending the company’s results were impacted as follows 

 

   

  

 in response to these market conditions the company took the following actions 

 

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2008 the company had 7610 million of debt obligations payable within one year substantially all of which matures in september 2009 and december 2009 the company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets or successful negotiation of other arrangements cannot be assured 

ongoing initiatives 

through the project acceleration restructuring program and other initiatives the company has made significant progress in improving capacity utilization rates to deliver productivity savings and increasing the use of strategic sourcing partners in order to achieve logistical excellence and optimize its geographic footprint the company continues to evaluate its supply chain to identify opportunities to realize efficiencies in purchasing distribution and transportation the company expects to incur between 100 and 150 million 80 and 120 million aftertax of project acceleration restructuring costs in 2009

consolidated results of operations 

the company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of operations are important in evaluating the company’s operations the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

 results of operations — 2008 vs 2007 

net sales for 2008 were 64706 million representing an increase of 633 million or 1 from 64073 million for 2007 the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions increased sales by 2047 million or 32 over the prior year and foreign currency contributed 08 of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions mid singledigit sales growth in the home  family segment was more than offset by a high singledigit decline in the tools  hardware segment and low singledigit declines in the cleaning organization  décor and office products segments 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2008 was 328 or 21232 million versus 352 or 22572 million for 2007 positive pricing and savings from project acceleration of approximately 400 million were more than offset by the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation as well as lower manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 

sga expenses for 2008 were 232 of net sales or 15027 million versus 223 of net sales or 14309 million for 2007 the 718 million increase was primarily driven by sga expenses associated with the technical concepts and aprica acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency which more than offset the impacts of the company’s management of structural and strategic sga spending 

the company recorded restructuring costs of 1203 million and 860 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in restructuring costs for 2008 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to 360 million of asset impairment charges recorded in 2008 associated with the company’s plan to divest downsize or exit certain product categories where resin is the primary component of cost of products sold the 2008 restructuring costs included 461 million of facility and other exit costs including the 360 million of asset impairment charges noted above 575 million of employee severance termination benefits and employee relocation costs and 167 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs of which 31 million relates to the company’s 2001 restructuring plan the 2007 restructuring costs included 277 million of facility and other exit costs 364 million of employee severance and termination benefits and 219 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs see footnote 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

 over the longterm the company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay certain debt maturities in addition the company reduced the dividend payable on its common stock by 50 

borrowing arrangements 

the company’s revolver expires in november 2012 as of december 31 2008 there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver and the company had 6900 million available for borrowing in lieu of borrowings under the revolver the company may issue up to 6900 million of commercial paper the revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper accordingly commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the revolver however the company’s current shortterm debt credit ratings coupled with turmoil in the credit markets may preclude it from accessing the commercial paper market the revolver also provides for the issuance of up to 1000 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the revolver there was no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the revolver 

the company has several covenants under its revolver and term loan facilities two of which are interest coverage and debt to total capitalization as of december 31 2008 the company had complied with all covenants under the facilities and had sufficiently exceeded the requirements for both the interest coverage and debt to total capitalization covenants a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company’s ability to borrow under the revolver and term loan 

debt 

the company’s objective is to finance the business through the appropriate mix of shortterm and longterm debt the company has varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business the volume and timing of production impacts the company’s cash flows and involves increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased 

  

customer demand through the remainder of the year working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through the commercial paper markets in the us which is supported by the revolver however access to the commercial paper market cannot be assured with the company’s current shortterm debt credit ratings and therefore the company may be required to access the revolver for future working capital needs 

total debt increased 6944 million to 29 billion as of december 31 2008 from 22 billion as of december 31 2007 the increase in 2008 resulted from the issuance of 7500 million of senior unsecured notes in march 2008 and 4000 million borrowed pursuant to the term loan offset by the repayment of 3150 million of medium term notes and 1970 million of commercial paper the december 31 2008 debt balance was also affected by the marktomarket adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixed rate debt pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities” as amended the marktomarket adjustments increased the carrying value of debt by 623 million in 2008 compared to 2007 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 7610 million of shortterm debt including a floating rate note of 4480 million related to its 2001 receivables facility that matures in september 2009 a 500 million principal payment on the term loan due in september 2009 and 2500 million of medium term notes that mature in december 2009 the company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements however access to the capital markets cannot be assured particularly in light of the recent turmoil and uncertainty in the global credit markets the february 2009 downgrade by moody’s and standard  poor’s of the company’s credit ratings to the lowest rating considered “investment grade” and alternative financing arrangements may result in higher borrowing costs for the company 

pension obligations 

the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries the company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets in 2008 total contributions to all of the company’s pension plans totaled approximately 326 million during 2008 the company’s primary us defined benefit pension plan moved from a near fully funded status to an approximate 2600 million underfunded status driven by a decrease in the value of plan assets because of this situation the company currently expects to make contributions to its primary us defined benefit pension plan of approximately 50 to 75 million in 2009 which is in addition to the 250 million of contributions expected to be made to the company’s other pension plans in 2009 

future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets the company determines its plan asset investment mix in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all plans at december 31 2008 approximately 41 of assets are invested in equities 23 in fixed income investments 17 in cash and 19 in other investments to the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 

dividends 

in january 2009 the company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from 021 per share to 0105 per share the company currently expects to maintain this dividend rate throughout 2009 however the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors including the company’s financial condition earnings legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 

credit ratings 

the company’s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies in february 2009 moody’s investors service downgraded the company’s longterm debt rating from baa2 to baa3 and its shortterm debt rating from p2 to p3 and standard  poor’s downgraded the company’s longterm rating from bbb to bbb and its shortterm debt rating from a2 to a3 both moody’s and standard  poor’s reaffirmed their negative outlook the company’s current senior debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are baa3 bbb and bbb respectively its current shortterm debt credit ratings from moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings are p3 a3 and f2 respectively changes in the company’s operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies refer to item 1a risk factors for a more detailed discussion of the company’s credit ratings 

  

outlook 

in 2009 the company expects to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to contribute 75 to 100 million to its foreign and us pension plans use 100 million of cash for restructuring activities related to project acceleration and fund capital expenditures of approximately 150 million which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap 

overall the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from future operations access to capital markets and availability under the revolver will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses assuming the company refinances its maturing shortterm debt in 2009 

resolution of income tax contingencies 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 the company recorded 299 million 413 million and 1028 million respectively in net income tax benefits as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the irs the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves the reversal of a valuation allowance the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in europe these benefits are reflected in the company’s 2008 2007 and 2006 consolidated statements of operations the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements certain other items such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december 31 2008 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements

 the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under continual audit by the irs and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1642 million in unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at december 31 2008 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets among other factors as of december 31 2008 the company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of 6077 million see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

critical accounting policies

sales recognition

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

in the third quarter of 2008 the company conducted its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level herein referred to as the reporting unit the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount the impact of the macroeconomic environment on the company during the fourth quarter of 2008 combined with the updated outlook for certain business units during the period led the company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december 31 2008 as a result during 2008 the company completed its annual impairment test during the third quarter of 2008 and completed an impairment test as of december 31 2008 based on events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of 2008 

in its goodwill impairment testing if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than the fair value impairment may be present the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units generally based on discounted cash flow models market multiples of earnings or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer if available the company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name the company’s use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets involves several assumptions and changes in assumptions could materially impact fair value estimates assumptions critical to the company’s fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow models include discount rates royalty rates and cash flow projections and inherent in cash flow projections are estimates regarding projected revenue growth rates projected cost reductions and efficiencies and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values 

the company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit’s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets the estimated values of the reporting unit’s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit’s total value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is also recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

for the annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2008 the company determined that the fair values of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of the company’s reporting units which were not deemed to be impaired based on the annual impairment testing in the third quarter would not cause the carrying value of each respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value 

for the impairment testing as of december 31 2008 the economic events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the associated impact on the outlooks for certain of the company’s reporting units led the company to record a noncash impairment charge of 2994 million principally related to goodwill of certain business units in the tools  hardware and office products segments 

see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base and net sales a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders’ equity the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present subsequent to december 31 2008 the company’s total market capitalization periodically 

  

declined below the company’s december 31 2008 consolidated stockholders’ equity balance if the company’s total market capitalization is below consolidated stockholders’ equity balance at a future reporting date or for a sustained period the company considers this an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill the company utilizes market capitalization in corroborating its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units as a result the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in additional impairment charges in the future 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software capitalized software costs were 1532 million at december 31 2008 capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2008 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 425 million as of december 31 2008 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into 

  

account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2008 ranged between 126 million and 303 million as of december 31 2008 the company had a reserve of 151 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

income taxes 

in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

for uncertain tax positions the company applies the provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the morelikelythannot outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results see footnote 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increases discussed below 

 

  

  

  

  

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 12 of the notes to consolidated 

  

financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008  in millions  

 

 the following table summarizes the net pretax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31  in millions  

 

 the company used weighted average discount rates of 60 and 63 to determine the expenses for 2008 for the pension and post retirement plans respectively the company used a weighted average expected return on assets of 79 to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2008 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and post retirement expenses holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

 the total projected benefit obligations of the company’s pension and post retirement plans as of december 31 2008 were 126 billion and 1625 million respectively the company used weighted average discount rates of 62 and 63 to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and post retirement plans respectively as of december 31 2008 the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and post retirement plans holding all other assumptions constant in millions  

 

 the company has 3091 million aftertax of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses 4984 million pretax included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity at december 31 2008 the unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan the net amount amortized to expense totaled 96 million pretax in 2008 and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future changes in actuarial assumptions actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements the company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of sfas 157 on january 1 2008 as required for financial assets and liabilities the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements the fasb issued staff position 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” “fsp 1572” which deferred the effective date of sfas 157 as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until january 1 2009 the adoption of sfas 157 for the company’s nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

sfas 157 emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date sfas 157 discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach comparable market prices the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions sfas 157 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the following is a brief description of those three levels 

 

  

  

 in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r significantly changes the accounting for business combination transactions by requiring an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value additionally sfas 141r modifies the accounting treatment for certain specified items related to business combinations and requires a substantial number of new disclosures sfas 141r is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited the company prospectively adopted sfas 141r on january 1 2009 the adoption of sfas 141r could have a material effect on the way the company accounts for future acquisitions

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment to fasb statement no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better understand how derivative instruments are accounted for under sfas 133 and their effects on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 is effective for the company beginning january 1 2009 the adoption of sfas 161 is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

in april 2008 the fasb issued staff position no 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” “fsp sfas 1423” fsp sfas 1423 amends the factors an entity should consider when developing renewal or extension assumptions for determining the useful lives of recognized intangible assets under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” fsp sfas 1423 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful lives of recognized intangible assets under sfas 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of acquired assets the guidance also requires expanded disclosure related to an entity’s intangible assets the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements shall be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of and subsequent to the effective date fsp sfas 1423 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years fsp sfas 1423 is effective for the company on january 1 2009 the adoption of fsp sfas 1423 is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s financial statements 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “sfas 162” sfas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles sfas 162 became effective on november 13 2008 the adoption of sfas 162 did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued staff position eitf 03061 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” “fsp eitf 03061” this staff position provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method in sfas no 128 “earnings per share” fsp eitf 03061 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years and requires all priorperiod earnings per share data to be adjusted retrospectively fsp eitf 03061 is effective for the company on january 1 2009 the adoption of fsp eitf 03061 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

in november 2008 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 087 “accounting for defensive intangible assets” “eitf 087” eitf 087 clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them eitf 087 requires an acquirer in a business combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting which should be amortized to expense over the period the asset diminishes in value eitf 087 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company prospectively adopted eitf 087 on january 1 2009 the adoption of eitf 087 could have a material effect on the way the company accounts for acquired intangible assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and its conservative debt ratio target interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates accordingly benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate fixed rate debt represented approximately 41 of the company’s 29 billion of total debt as of december 31 2008 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company’s sales expenses and operating transactions are conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in us dollars the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts and purchased options as economic hedges for 

  

commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transactions gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 

the company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its entities to us dollars the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk the company hedges portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries including intercompany loans with forward contracts and crosscurrency hedges gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency hedges which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in other comprehensive income 

commodity prices 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

financial instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 as follows in millions  

 

 see footnote 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

value at risk 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table sets forth the one day valueatrisk as of and for the year ended december 31  in millions except percentages  

 

  

 the yearoveryear increase in valueatrisk in foreign exchange is primarily due to a significant increase in the volatility of foreign exchange rates in 2008 the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the 

  

company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time additionally since the company operates globally and therefore among a broad basket of currencies its foreign currency exposure is diversified these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

strategic initiatives 

create consumermeaningful brands 

the company is continuing to move from its historical focus on customer push marketing and excelling in manufacturing and distributing products to a new focus on consumer pull marketing and creating competitive advantage through better understanding its consumers innovating to deliver great performance and value investing in advertising and promotion to create demand and leveraging its brands in adjacent categories around the world consumermeaningful brands create more value than products alone and big brands provide the company with the economies of scale that can be leveraged in today’s marketplace 

in 2007 the company made incremental investments in strategic brand building for several brands including sharpie ®  paper mate ®  rubbermaid ®  graco ®  calphalon ® and goody ®  in just two years the company has increased its investment in strategic brand building almost 60 to 62 of sales the company is committed to increasing selective television print direct mail and online advertising and using sampling and product demonstrations where appropriate to increase brand awareness and trials among endusers of its brands during 2007 the company sponsored the 26 irwin ® car in the nascar nextel cup series the sharpie ® 500 nascar race in bristol tennessee and the lenox ® industrial tools 300 nascar race in loudon new hampshire in 2008 the company anticipates focusing its advertising and sponsorships in similar areas 

the company continues to employ resources to create bestinclass branding capabilities across the company as part of the company’s marketing build and transform initiative it has created a detailed blueprint and roadmap for achieving brand building excellence over time complete with annual targets and measures the company has added top executive talent from some of the world’s leading consumer products companies to its management ranks as well as developed and launched a comprehensive series of marketing excellence training programs covering both basic and advanced curriculums to expand and develop consumer marketing capabilities and further enhance consumer understanding the company’s brand building initiatives and the increased investments in research training and consumernoticeable spending activities have contributed to the company realizing market share gains in certain key brands notably in the calphalon goody dymo and rubbermaid commercial products businesses and global growth in the irwin and lenox branded tools businesses

leverage one newell rubbermaid 

the company is committed to leveraging the common business activities and best practices of its business units and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork through this initiative the company strives to benefit from the reduction of costs achieved through horizontal integration and economies of scale for example the company continues to explore ways to leverage its common functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain management and finance to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company is also taking significant steps toward achieving low cost logistical excellence including the centralization and consolidation of the company’s distribution and transportation activities the centralization of these functions will increase buying power across the company 

additionally certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level including cash management accounting systems capital expenditure approvals restructuring approvals order processing billing credit accounts receivable collections data processing operations and legal functions centralization concentrates technical expertise in one location making it easier to communicate observe overall business trends and manage the company’s businesses 

the company previously accelerated the process of creating shared services for the european businesses and is expanding the scope of shared services in the us and latin america the transition of services to the shared service center in europe is approximately 90 complete in addition in its move to a consistent gbu structure the company has recently created and expanded leadership positions to identify and drive synergies across business units 

on october 1 2007 the company’s office products segment successfully went live with the sap implementation for its north american operations this sap golive marks the completion of the first major milestone in a multiyear rollout aimed at migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap global information platform 

 5  

this will enable the company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently 

achieve best total cost 

the company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing sourcing and supplying product on an ongoing basis and to leverage the company’s size and scale in order to achieve a best total cost position in relevant product categories achieving best cost positions in its categories allows the company to increase investment in strategic brand building initiatives to improve productivity the company focuses on reducing procurement material handling and distribution and transportation costs driving manufacturing efficiencies and removing excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing and delivering products the company has also shifted a portion of its research and development efforts to focus on ways to design future products that can be manufactured more cost effectively 

a key component of this strategy is the company’s sourcing transformation — restructuring the manufacturing and sourcing footprint to reduce total delivered cost including increasing capacity utilization and the percentage of manufacturing located in lowercost countries as well as achieving a balance of companyowned manufacturing and third party sourcing partners project acceleration remains on track to deliver its commitments in cost savings and timing over the life of the project and the company has realized savings in its operating results project acceleration is projected to result in cumulative restructuring costs of approximately 375 million to 400 million 315 million to 340 million after tax approximately 67 of the costs are expected to be cash annualized savings from project acceleration are expected to exceed 150 million upon conclusion of the project in 2009 with 60 million in annual savings recognized in 2007 and additional benefits of 60 million and 30 million projected for 2008 and 2009 respectively to date the company has announced approximately twothirds of its anticipated closings and consolidations and has announced the expansion of the program to include certain scale leveraging initiatives with respect to distribution transportation and shared services 

the company is also committed to reducing nonstrategic selling general and administrative “sga” costs throughout the organization the company is vigilant in creating a leaner organization that is more flexible in its response time both internally and externally the company’s efforts to leverage one newell rubbermaid through horizontal integration will help the company to achieve this goal 

nurture 360º innovation 

the company has broadened its definition of innovation beyond product invention the company defines innovation as the successful commercialization of invention it is a rigorous consumercentric process that permeates the entire development cycle it begins with a deep understanding of how consumers interact with the company’s brands and categories and all the factors that drive their purchase decisions and inuse experience that understanding must then be translated into innovative products that deliver unique features and benefits at a bestcost position providing the consumer with great value lastly innovating how and where to create awareness and trial use and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending completes the process the company has pockets of excellence using this expanded definition of innovation and continues to build on this competency in its effort to create consumermeaningful brands since the beginning of 2007 the company launched a number of innovative new products including the sharpie ® chisel tip levolor ® roman shades lenox ® diamond™ saw blades graco ® imonitor™ and the rubbermaid ® premier line of premium food storage containers additionally the company’s baby and parenting essentials business launched the graco sweetpeacenewborn soothing center in early 2008 this product reinvents the swing category by offering babies a multisensory experience that mimics the actual movements mothers use to soothe their infants and comes programmed with comforting prenatal sounds such as a heartbeat that research has proven to be especially comforting to babies the company is investing in a targeted multimedia print and web marketing campaign to support the launch of this innovative new product

growth strategy 

the company’s growth strategy includes internal growth and acquisitions the company is also increasingly focused on globalization and the significant opportunities to further expand internationally 

internal growth 

the company focuses on internal growth principally by understanding consumers demand creation through marketing commercializing innovative new products entering new domestic and international markets adding new customers crossselling existing product lines to current customers and supporting its usbased customers’ international expansion internal growth is generally defined by the company as growth from continuing businesses owned more than one year 

acquisition strategy 

the company supplements internal growth by selectively acquiring businesses with prominent enduser focused brands and improving the profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the company’s strategic initiatives strategic criteria for an acquisition include the existence of consumermeaningful brands that reflect differentiation and innovation global categories favorable customer and channel dynamics strong margin and growth potential focus on noncyclical semidurable products and synergies with our core categories and competencies 

globalization 

the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus the growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several regions outside the us particularly central and eastern europe asia mexico and south america makes them attractive to the company by providing selective opportunities to acquire businesses develop partnerships with new foreign customers and extend relationships with the company’s domestic customers whose businesses are growing internationally as a result the company pursues selective international opportunities to further its internal growth and acquisition objectives the company’s sales outside the us approximated 28 26 and 24 of total sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the company has made significant strides in structuring itself for successful globalization in 2007 the company realigned its businesses under a gbu structure this realignment positions the businesses to leverage research and development branding marketing and innovation on a global basis the company has also implemented the process of creating shared services for the european businesses which is approximately 90 complete finally the company is in the early stages of migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap global information platform which will enable the company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently 

divestiture and product line rationalization 

the company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings assesses their strategic fit and seeks opportunities to divest nonstrategic businesses the criteria used by the company in assessing the strategic fit include the existence of consumermeaningful brands that respond to differentiation and innovation global categories favorable customer and channel dynamics strong margin and growth potential focus on noncyclical semidurable products synergies with our core categories and competencies and the business’ actual and potential impact on the operating performance of the company while the company believes that the business units remaining in our portfolio constitute core businesses the company will continue to review its businesses and product offerings and assess their strategic fit 

during 2006 and early 2007 the company divested its european cookware little tikes and home décor europe businesses during 2005 the company divested its curver business see footnote 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of discontinued operations 

 7  

in the normal course of business the company rationalizes low margin products the company’s decision to exit these low margin product lines is consistent with its strategy to focus on high margin high potential opportunities that support the company’s financial objectives 

other information

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands and differentiated products delivering superior customer service including innovative “goodbetterbest” marketing and merchandising programs consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores contract stationers and military exchanges the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 13 of net sales in 2007 across substantially all business units the company’s top ten customers included  in alphabetical order  boise office lowe’s office depot staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers w w grainger and walmart

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters terrorist attacks and political unrest the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict and one or more of the factors could adversely impact our business in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and well established the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with the company’s products 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation the resulting risks to the company include possible loss of sales reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

to compete successfully the company must develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand 

the company’s longterm success in the competitive retail environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products the company’s strategy includes increased investment in new product development and increased focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales or operating income 

to compete successfully the company must develop and maintain big consumermeaningful brands 

the company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand consumermeaningful brands allow the company to realize economies of scale in its operations the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives while the company is substantially increasing its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing initiatives the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

 10  

price increases in raw materials could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases some raw materials including resin glass corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process raw material price increases may more than offset productivity gains and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve productivity and streamline operations 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline nonstrategic selling general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and allow the company to invest in innovation and brand building project acceleration includes the closure of approximately onethird of the company’s 64 manufacturing facilities adjusted for the divestiture of little tikes and home décor europe in addition the company continuously explores ways to best leverage its functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain management and finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company runs the risk that project acceleration and other corporate initiatives aimed at streamlining operations and processes and cost reduction may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated or that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required after such projects are completed in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of project acceleration could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company’s ability to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses is an important factor in the company’s future growth 

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth furthermore the cost of any future major acquisitions could constrain the company’s access to capital and increase the company’s borrowing costs 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model 

foreign operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in the far east it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

the company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation 

the company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolioholding company that grew through acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation such a transformation will require significant investment in brandbuilding marketing and product development and the development of the right methods for understanding how consumers interact with the company’s brands and categories and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending although the process is well underway significant challenges and uncertainties remain 

complications in connection with the company’s current information system initiative may impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 11  

the company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap on october 1 2007 the company successfully went live with the sap implementation at its north american office products business unit this sap golive marks the completion of the first major milestone in a multiyear implementation that will occur in several phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the company’s customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools we use to take orders procure material schedule production remit billings make payments and perform other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions all of these risks could adversely impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base the unfavorable resolution of litigation including patent infringement litigation involving psi systems inc or a material adverse change in the company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of its enduser brands the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy

sources 

historically the company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have included cash provided by operations proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 6553 million compared to 6434 million for the comparable period of 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily a result of increased net income offset by increased investments in working capital including cash restructuring costs 

in 2007 the company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of 4208 million compared to 1770 million in 2006 proceeds in 2007 reflect the issuance of commercial paper to fund the acquisition of psi systems inc “endicia” a provider of endicia internet postage and to pay off a 2500 million 60 fixed rate mediumterm note that matured 

on november 14 2005 the company entered into a 7500 million fiveyear syndicated revolving credit facility the “revolver” on an annual basis the company may request an extension of the revolver subject to lender approval for additional oneyear periods the company elected to extend the revolver for additional oneyear periods in both october 2006 and october 2007 and as a result the revolver will now expire in november 2012 all but one lender approved the 2006 and 2007 extensions accordingly the company has a 7500 million facility through november 2010 and a 7250 million facility from november 2010 to november 2012 at december 31 2007 and 2006 there were no borrowings under the revolver 

in lieu of borrowings under the revolver the company may issue up to 7500 million of commercial paper through 2010 and 7250 million thereafter through 2012 the revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper accordingly commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the revolver the revolver also provides for the issuance of up to 1000 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the revolver at december 31 2007 

 26  

there was 1970 million of commercial paper outstanding classified as current longterm debt and no standby letters of credit issued under the revolver at december 31 2006 there was no commercial paper outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the revolver 

the revolver permits the company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms and requires among other things that the company maintain certain interest coverage and total indebtedness to total capital ratio as defined in the agreement the revolver also limits subsidiary indebtedness as defined in the agreement as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the company was in compliance with the terms of the agreement governing the revolver 

under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution the company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the company’s financial statements under this facility the company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the company’s us trade receivables to the financing entity in 2001 the financing entity issued 4500 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution certain levels of accounts receivable writeoffs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables facility on september 18 2006 in accordance with the terms of the receivables facility the financing entity caused the preferred debt securities to be exchanged for cash of 22 million a two year floating rate note in an aggregate principal amount of 4480 million and a cash premium of 52 million because this debt matures in september 2008 the entire amount is considered to be shortterm at december 31 2007 at any time prior to maturity of the note the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt securities of the financing entity with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note the note must be repaid and any preferred debt securities into which the note is converted must be retired or redeemed before the company can have access to the financing entity’s receivables as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under this facility was 6433 million and 6967 million respectively the receivables and the preferred debt securities or note as applicable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the company 

the company believes that available cash cash flows generated from future operations access to debt markets and availability under its revolving credit facility including issuing commercial paper will be adequate to fund the company’s shortterm and longterm financing needs 

uses

capital expenditures were 1573 million and 1383 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in capital expenditures was driven by spending related to the company’s sap initiative capital expenditures including sap for 2008 are expected to be in the range of 160 million to 180 million

 28  

 

the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits as a large taxpayer the company is under continual audit by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the 1644 million in unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 is excluded from the preceding table see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

additionally the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as disclosed in that footnote the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a case by case basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted as of december 31 2007 the company had allowances for doubtful accounts of 261 million on 11925 million of accounts receivable 

 29  

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company conducts its annual test for impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process 

the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually at the operating segment level herein referred to as the reporting unit the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value impairment may be present the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill based on discounted cash flow models earnings multiples or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer if available the use of a discounted cash flow model involves several assumptions and changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates assumptions critical to the company’s fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate projected average revenue growth projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values and product costs a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our reporting units which were not deemed to be impaired based on the testing of goodwill in the third quarter as described above would not cause the carrying value of any reporting unit to exceed its fair value 

the company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

the company also evaluates indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount assumptions critical to the company’s evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in its evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

no impairment charges were recorded by the company as a result of the annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 

capitalized software costs 

the company capitalizes costs associated with internaluse software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development capitalized internaluse software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software ii payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose the company expenses as incurred research and development general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internaluse software in addition the company expenses as incurred training maintenance and other internaluse software costs incurred during the postimplementation stage costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internaluse 

 30  

software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software capitalized software costs were 1314 million and 863 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december 31 2007 or 2006 

the company amortizes internaluse software costs using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values at the date of evaluation 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company’s strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 344 million as of december 31 2007 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability “cercla” matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2007 ranged between 145 million and 339 million as of december 31 2007 the company had a reserve of 188 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

income taxes 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach under this approach deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the 

 31  

financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 

the company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 

the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” on january 1 2007 fin 48 requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions the company’s ongoing assessments of the morelikelythannot outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results the adoption of fin 48 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings however it did result in the reclassification of certain income tax assets and liabilities from current to longterm in the company’s consolidated balance sheet see footnote 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates health care cost trend rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates and rate of compensation increase discussed below 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense see footnote 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used the following tables summarize the company’s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007  in millions

the following table summarizes the net pretax cost benefit associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31  in millions  

 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r significantly changes the accounting for business combination transactions by requiring an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value additionally sfas 141r modifies the accounting treatment for certain specified items related to business combinations and requires a substantial number of new disclosures sfas 141r is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited the company expects to prospectively adopt sfas 141r on january 1 2009 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas 160 also establishes reporting requirements that require sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited sfas 160 is effective for the company on january 1 2009 the company is still in the process of evaluating the impact sfas 160 will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability sfas 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued staff positions 1571 and 1572 which remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas 157 and partially defer the effective date of sfas 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of sfas 157 on january 1 2008 the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 

the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form 1 offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows 2 structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk 3 converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4 avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency in addition the company primarily utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany 

 34  

transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company’s consolidated statements of income 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions  

 

 the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

strategic initiatives 

create consumermeaningful brands 

the company is moving from its historical focus on customer push marketing and excelling in manufacturing and distributing products to a new focus on consumer pull marketing and creating competitive advantage through understanding our consumers innovating to deliver great performance and value investing in advertising and promotion to create demand and leveraging our brands in adjacent categories around the world consumermeaningful brands create more value than products alone and big brands provide the company with the economies of scale that can be leveraged in today’s marketplace in 2006 the company made incremental investments in strategic brand building particularly on the calphalon ®  graco ®  goody ®  lenox ®  irwin ®  sharpie ® and dymo ® brands the company also initiated a consulting and training partnership with one of the largest worldwide creative and media agencies to create bestinclass branding capabilities across the company 

the company is committed to increasing selective television or print advertising and using sampling and product demonstrations where appropriate to increase brand awareness and trial among endusers of our brands in 2006 the company sponsored the 26 irwin ® car in the nascar nextel cup series the sharpie ® 500 nascar race in bristol tennessee and the lenox ® 300 nascar race in loudon new hampshire in 2007 irwin ® will sponsor the 26 car lenox ® will sponsor the 31 car and sharpie ® will have an associate sponsorship for the 8 car also in 2007 lenox ® will sponsor the lenox ® 300 race at the new hampshire international speedway and sharpie ® will sponsor both the sharpie ® mini 300 busch series race and the sharpie ® 500 race at bristol motor speedway 

leverage one newell rubbermaid 

the company strives to benefit from the sharing of best practices and the reduction of costs achieved through horizontal integration and economies of scale for example the company is exploring ways to leverage its common functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain and finance to improve efficiency and reduce costs certain functions such as purchasing and distribution and transportation have been centralized to increase buying power across the company 

additionally certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level including cash management accounting systems capital expenditure approvals order processing billing credit accounts receivable data 

 5  

processing operations and legal functions centralization concentrates technical expertise in one location making it easier to observe overall business trends and manage the company’s businesses 

the company accelerated the process of creating shared services for the european businesses in 2006 and is evaluating expanding the scope of shared services in the united states the transition of services to the shared service center in europe is approximately twothirds complete in addition the company has recently created leadership positions — vice president of program management and president of newell rubbermaid europe middle east and africa — to identify and drive synergies across business units 

finally the company is in the early stages of migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap global information platform which we expect will enable the company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting process more efficiently phase one implementation is currently planned for the north american office products business in late 2007 the total company implementation will occur over several years in phases that are primarily based on geographic region and segment 

achieve best total cost 

the company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing sourcing and supplying product on an ongoing basis and to leverage the company’s size and scale in order to achieve a best total cost position in relevant product categories achieving best cost positions in its categories allows the company to increase investment in strategic brand building initiatives to improve productivity the company focuses on reducing procurement costs material handling costs manufacturing inefficiencies and removing excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing products as well as reducing the cost of distribution and transportation the company has also shifted a portion of its research and development focus to designing lower cost into future product initiatives 

a key component of this strategy is the restructuring of the company’s manufacturing and sourcing network to increase capacity utilization increase the percentage of manufacturing located in lowcost countries and achieve a balance of companyowned manufacturing and third party sourcing partners in the third quarter of 2005 the company announced a global initiative referred to as project acceleration aimed at strengthening and transforming the company’s portfolio in connection with project acceleration the board of directors of the company approved a restructuring plan that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005 project acceleration includes the closure of approximately onethird of the company’s 64 manufacturing facilities as of december 31 2005 adjusted for the divestiture of little tikes and home décor europe optimizing the company’s geographic manufacturing footprint since the inception of project acceleration the company has announced the closure of 14 manufacturing facilities project acceleration is projected to result in cumulative restructuring costs of approximately 375 to 400 million 315 million — 340 million after tax approximately 60 of the costs are expected to be cash annualized savings are projected to exceed 150 million upon conclusion of the program in 2009 

the deployment of newell operational excellence newell opex throughout the company’s manufacturing network is also aimed at delivering the company’s productivity targets newell opex is a methodical process focused on lean manufacturing that includes installing the right manufacturing and distribution metrics and driving improvements quarter after quarter in addition to the cost reductions other key components of newell opex are improved quality and service levels and the reduction of inventory lead times 

the company is also committed to reducing nonstrategic sga costs throughout the organization the company is vigilant in creating a leaner organization that is more flexible in its response time both internally and externally the company’s efforts to leverage one newell rubbermaid through horizontal integration will help the company to achieve this goal 

nurture 360º innovation 

the company has broadened its definition of innovation beyond product invention the company now defines innovation as the successful commercialization of invention innovation must be more than product development it is a rigorous consumer centric process that permeates the entire development cycle it begins with a deep understanding of how consumers interact with the company’s brands and categories and all the factors that drive their purchase decisions and inuse experience that understanding must then be translated into innovative products that deliver unique features and benefits at a bestcost position providing the consumer with great value lastly innovating how and where to 

 6  

create awareness and trial and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending completes the process the company has pockets of excellence using this expanded definition of innovation and it will continue to build on this competency 

over the last two years the company launched a number of innovative new products including the sharpie ® mini permanent marker irwin ® speedbor ® max drill bits the irwin ® quickgrip ® xp one handed bar clamp lenox ® pro hose air acetylene kits rubbermaid ® collapsibles™ food storage containers rubbermaid ® commercial microfiber cleaning tools and accessories and wavebreak™ mop bucket calphalon ® one™ infused anodized calphalon ® one™ nonstick and contemporary stainless lines of gourmet cookware and katana series™ cutlery line goody stay put™ elastic bands and ouchless ® brush collection and graco ® mosaic™ stroller and travel system and safe seat™ car seats 

growth strategy 

the company’s growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and acquisitions the company is also increasingly focused on globalization 

internal growth 

the company focuses on internal growth principally by understanding consumers demand creation through marketing commercializing innovative new products entering new domestic and international markets adding new customers crossselling existing product lines to current customers and supporting its usbased customers’ international expansion internal growth is defined by the company as growth from continuing businesses owned more than one year and immaterial acquisitions 

acquisition strategy 

the company supplements internal growth by selectively acquiring businesses with prominent enduser focused brands and improving the profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the company’s strategic initiatives strategic criteria for an acquisition include the existence of consumermeaningful brands that respond to differentiation and innovation global categories favorable customer and channel dynamics strong margin and growth potential focus on noncyclical semidurable products and synergies with our core categories and competencies 

during 2005 the company acquired dymo a global leader in designing manufacturing and marketing ondemand labeling solutions from esselte ab this acquisition strengthens the company’s global leadership position in the office products segment by expanding and enhancing the company’s product lines and customer base see footnote 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions 

globalization 

the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus the growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several regions outside the us particularly eastern europe asia mexico and south america makes them attractive to the company by providing selective opportunities to acquire businesses develop partnerships with new foreign customers and extend relationships with the company’s domestic customers whose businesses are growing internationally as a result the company pursues selective international opportunities to further its internal growth and acquisition objectives the company had sales outside the us of approximately 26 24 and 24 of total sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

the company is striving to get the right structure in place for successful globalization for example the office products businesses have been reorganized to operate across product lines that can target global consumer acceptance in 2006 the company also aligned the graco business under a global business unit structure reporting under the home  family segment rather than by geographic location this realignment positions the businesses to leverage research and development branding marketing and innovation on a global basis the company has also implemented the process of creating shared services for the european businesses which is approximately twothirds complete and has created the leadership position of president – newell rubbermaid europe middle east and africa 

 7  

to identify and drive synergies across business units in the region finally the company is in the early stages of migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap global information platform which we expect will enable the company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting process more efficiently 

divestiture and product line rationalization 

the company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings assesses their strategic fit and seeks opportunities to divest nonstrategic businesses the criteria used by the company in assessing the strategic fit include the existence of consumermeaningful brands that respond to differentiation and innovation global categories favorable customer and channel dynamics strong margin and growth potential focus on noncyclical semidurable products synergies with our core categories and competencies and the business’s actual and potential impact on the operating performance of the company while we believe that the business units remaining in our portfolio constitute core businesses the company will continue to review its businesses and product offerings and assess their strategic fit to identify any potential divestiture candidates 

during 2006 and early 2007 the company divested its european cookware little tikes and home décor europe businesses during 2005 the company divested its curver business in 2004 the company sold its us picture frame business burnes its anchor hocking glassware business its mirro cookware business its panex brazilian lowend cookware business its european picture frames business and its little tikes commercial play systems business see footnote 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of discontinued operations 

in 2006 2005 and 2004 the company rationalized 60 million 195 million and 165 million respectively in lowmargin product sales primarily in the former cleaning  organization segment the company’s decision to exit these low margin product lines is consistent with its strategy to focus on high margin high potential opportunities that support the company’s financial objectives 

other information 

multiproduct offering 

the company’s broad product coverage in multiple product lines permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers with families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new products the company also can help volume purchasers sell a more profitable product mix as a potential single source for an entire product line the company can use program merchandising to improve product presentation optimize display space for both sales and income and encourage impulse buying by retail customers 

customer marketing and service 

the company strives to develop longterm mutually beneficial partnerships with its customers and become their supplier and brand of choice to achieve this goal the company has a valueadded marketing program that offers a family of leading brand name staple products tailored sales programs innovative merchandising support instore services and responsive top management 

the company strives to enhance its relationships with customers through exceptional customer service the company’s ability to provide superior customer service is a result of its information technology marketing and merchandising programs designed to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and provide consistent ontime delivery of its products 

a critical element of the company’s customer service is consistent ontime delivery of products to its customers retailers are pursuing a number of strategies to deliver the highestquality bestcost products to their customers retailers now frequently purchase on a “justintime” basis in order to reduce inventory carrying costs and increase returns on investment as retailers shorten their lead times for orders manufacturers need to more closely anticipate consumerbuying patterns the company supports its retail customers’ “justintime” inventory strategies through more responsive sourcing manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic communications

raw materials 

the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities the company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin glass corrugate and metals including steel stainless steel zinc aluminum and gold the company has experienced inflation in these raw materials and expects such inflation pressures to continue in 2007 the company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through product line rationalization and strategic divestitures see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

backlog 

the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material 

seasonal variations 

the company’s sales and operating income in the first quarter are generally lower than any other quarter during the year driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the quarter 

patents and trademarks 

the company has many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are in the aggregate important to its business the company’s most significant registered trademarks are “rubbermaid ® ” “sharpie ® ” “paper mate ® ” “lenox ® ” “irwin ® ” “graco ® ” “levolor ® ” and “dymo ® ” 

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in category management and customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumermeaningful brands differentiated products superior customer service including innovative “goodbetterbest” marketing and merchandising programs consistent ontime delivery outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost countries where appropriate and experienced management 

 9  

the company has also positioned itself to respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores contract stationers and military exchanges the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 12 of net sales in 2006 across substantially all business units the company’s top ten customers included  in alphabetical order  ace hardware boise office lowe’s office depot staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart

research and development 

information regarding the company’s research and development costs for each of the past three fiscal years is included in footnote 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition and consolidation among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and well established the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company 

 10  

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big consumermeaningful brands the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation the resulting risks to the company include possible loss of sales reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

to compete successfully the company must develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand 

the company’s longterm success in this competitive retail environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products the company’s strategy includes increased investment in new product development and increased focus on innovation there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth results 

to compete successfully the company must develop and maintain big consumermeaningful brands 

the company’s competitive success also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain consumermeaningful brands so that the company’s retailer customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand and big brands to provide the company with economies of scale the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives while the company is substantially increasing its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing initiatives the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases some raw materials including resin glass corrugate steel gold zinc brass and aluminum which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressure the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases future delivery purchases longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process raw material price increases may offset productivity gains and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve productivity and streamline operations 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing efficiencies reduce supply chain costs and streamline nonstrategic sga expenses in order to produce products at a bestcost position and free up money for investment in innovation and brand building project acceleration includes the closure of approximately onethird of the company’s 64 manufacturing facilities adjusted for the divestiture of little tikes and home décor europe between the periods january 1 2006 and december 31 2009 in addition the company is exploring ways to best leverage its functional capabilities such as human resources information technology customer service supply chain and finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company runs the risk that project acceleration and other corporate initiatives aimed at streamlining and cost reduction may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated or that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required after such projects are completed in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of project acceleration could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company’s ability to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses is an important factor in the company’s future growth 

 11  

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth furthermore the cost of any future major acquisitions could constrain the company’s access to capital and increase the company’s borrowing costs 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

foreign operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business the company is expanding from a uscentric business model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in the far east it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization exchange controls interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

the company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation 

the company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolioholding company that grew through acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by consumermeaningful brands and new product innovation such a transformation will require significant investment in brandbuilding marketing and product development and the development of the right methods for understanding how consumers interact with the company’s brands and categories and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending although the process is well underway there remain significant challenges and uncertainties 

complications in connection with the company’s current information system initiative may impact its results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company is in the early stages of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from sap the pilot implementation is currently planned for the north american office products business in late 2007 the implementation will occur over several years in phases primarily based on geographic region and segment this activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common sap information platform throughout this process the company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles in processing and utilizing information in addition this conversion will impact certain interfaces with the company’s customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools we use to take orders procure material schedule production remit billings make payments and perform other business functions based upon the complexity of this initiative there is risk that the company will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur additional costs the implementation could result in operating inefficiencies and the implementation could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions all of these risks could adversely impact the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base or a material adverse change in its relationship with significant customers 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace or 

 12  

the value of its enduser brands the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy

critical accounting policies 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in footnote 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements the following sections describe the company’s critical accounting policies 

sales recognition 

sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms sales are net of provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 

recovery of accounts receivable 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience accounts are reviewed for potential writeoff on a case by case basis accounts deemed uncollectible are written off net of expected recoveries if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted as of december 31 2006 the company had allowances for doubtful accounts of 263 million on 11399 million of accounts receivable 

 30  

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses the company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying amount the company tests for impairment at the operating segment level 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers additionally increases in the risk adjusted rate could result in impairment charges 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames in its impairment tests generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer if available the discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital terminal value and market discount rates the underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan 

if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value goodwill impairment may be present the company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value 

other longlived assets 

the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with 

 31  

actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 306 million as of december 31 2006 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2006 ranged between 159 million and 356 million as of december 31 2006 the company had a reserve of 198 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

income tax contingencies 

the company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the company’s tax position will be ultimately sustained the company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the company’s tax position will ultimately be sustained which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item the company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax matters actual results may differ from the recorded amounts 

stock options 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods under this transition method stockbased compensation expense for 2006 includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” stockbased compensation expense for all awards granted after december 31 2005 is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock prior to the adoption of sfas 123r the company recognized stockbased compensation expense by applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the sharebased payment awards and stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected prevesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest if our actual prevesting forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from our estimates see footnote 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of stockbased compensation

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements the interpretation would require a review of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 109 and apply a morelikelythannot recognition threshold a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information subsequent recognition derecognition and measurement is based on management’s best judgment given the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 which the company intends to adopt on january 1 2007 the company does not believe the new interpretation will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations however adoption may result in the reclassification of certain income tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and an immaterial adjustment to the balance of retained earnings 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and the company intends to adopt the standard on january 1 2008 the company is currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 157 will have on its financial position results of operations and cash flows but does not believe the effect will be material 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income sfas 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position beginning with years ending after december 15 2008 with limited exceptions effective december 31 2006 the company recognized the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plan and provided the required disclosures as a result of the adoption of sfas 158 the effect of adoption of sfas 158 on the company’s financial condition at december 31 2006 has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements see footnote 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the company currently measures defined benefit plan assets and liabilities for the majority of its plans on september 30 th and expects to adopt the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 in 2008

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 

the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form 1 offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows 2 structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk 3 converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4 avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency in addition the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company’s consolidated statements of operations 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel stainless steel aluminum and other metals which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process during 2006 the company experienced raw material inflation which was more than offset by pricing increases favorable mix and productivity 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation 

 34  

of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in millions except percentages 

 

the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

  backlog

customers  competition 

the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers this environment limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices 

current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands are for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in customer service the company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well established 

the company has positioned itself to respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores home centers office superstores contract stationers and military exchanges the company’s largest customer walmart which includes sam’s club accounted for approximately 14 of net sales in 2005 across substantially all divisions the company’s top ten customers included  in alphabetical order  ace hardware lowe’s office depot office max staples target the home depot toys ‘r’ us united stationers and walmart 

the company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are high brand name recognition superior customer service including innovative “goodbetterbest” marketing and merchandising programs consistent ontime delivery decentralized manufacturing and marketing centralized administration outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost countries where appropriate and experienced management

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors that are discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference herein could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world 

the company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world primarily in north america and to a lesser extent europe central and south america and asia these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry which in turn are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters and the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 in recent years the retail industry in the us and increasingly elsewhere has been characterized by intense competition and consolidation among retailers because such competition particularly in weak retail economies can cause retailers to struggle or fail the company must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in the profitability creditworthiness and pricing policies of its customers 

the company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers 

the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products many of which are large and well established the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores and commercial distributors the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to the formation of dominant multicategory retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products of the company 

the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products continuing improvements in customer service and the maintenance of strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation the resulting risks to the company include possible loss of sales reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 

to compete successfully the company must develop a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand 

  the company’s longterm success in this competitive retail environment depends on its ability to develop a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand for the company’s products the company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the company’s products project acceleration a threeyear initiative announced in september 2005 includes increased investment in new product development there are nevertheless numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and introducing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not deliver expected growth results 

to compete successfully the company must develop and maintain strong enduser brands 

the company’s competitive success also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain strong enduser brands so that the company’s retailer customers will need the company’s products to meet consumer demand the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives while the company is substantially increasing its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing initiatives as a part of project acceleration the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results 

price increases in raw materials could harm the company’s financial results 

the company purchases some raw materials including resin corrugate steel and aluminum that are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressure the company attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs including periodic purchases purchases for future delivery longterm contracts and sales price adjustments where practical the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process raw material price increases may offset productivity gains and could materially impact the company’s financial results 

the company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve productivity and streamline operations principally by reducing its manufacturing overhead 

the company’s objective is to become its retailer customers’ lowcost provider and global supplier and brand of choice to do this the company needs to continuously improve its manufacturing efficiencies and develop sources of supply on a global basis project acceleration includes the closure of approximately onethird of the company’s 80 manufacturing facilities as of september 2005 over the next three years the company also needs to continue to divest lowmargin product lines that do not fit in the company’s strategic plan the company runs the risk that project acceleration may not be completed substantially as planned may be more costly to implement than expected or may not have the positive effects anticipated or that another major productivity and streamlining program may be required after project acceleration is completed in addition disruptions in the company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of project acceleration could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company needs to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses 

although the company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth by acquisition the company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time remain important factors in the company’s future growth for example the successful integration of the recently acquired dymo business into the company’s office products segment is important to the company’s success furthermore the cost of any future major acquisitions could constrain the company’s access to capital and increase the company’s borrowing costs 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

foreign operations especially in europe but also in asia central and south america and canada are important to the company’s business in november 2005 the company acquired the dymo business and thereby increased the magnitude of the company’s operations in europe in addition as the company increasingly sources products in lowcost countries particularly in the far east it is exposed to additional risks and uncertainties foreign operations can be affected by factors such as currency devaluation other currency fluctuations tariffs nationalization 

  exchange controls interest rates limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political economic and regulatory risks and difficulties the company also faces risks due to the transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing 

the company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through strong brands and new product innovation 

the company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolioholding company that grew through acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by strong brands and new product innovation although the process is well underway there remain significant challenges and uncertainties 

impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the company’s assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base or a material adverse change in its relationship with significant customers 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the company’s financial results or harm its reputation or the value of its enduser brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the company’s products arise in the ordinary course of the company’s business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its enduser brands the company could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a selfinsured retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors when aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience if circumstances related to specific customers change the company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted as of december 31 2005 the company had allowances for doubtful accounts of 318 million on 12345 million of accounts receivable 

inventory reserves 

the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses the company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying amount 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s customer base or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames in its impairment tests generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer if available the discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital terminal value and market discount rates the underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan 

if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value goodwill impairment may be present the company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value 

other longlived assets 

the company tests its other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” in accordance with 

  sfas no 144 the company evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows the company discounts the future cash flows using a riskfree discount rate and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally the company performs its testing of the asset group at the productline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

product liability reserves 

the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves the company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company’s product liability reserve the company has product liability reserves of 283 million as of december 31 2005 while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

legal and environmental reserves 

the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal state local and foreign laws and regulations as well as contract and other disputes the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based largely on historical experience the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts including legal fees where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company’s cost estimates or reserve nor do the company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes except with respect to longterm operations and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2005 ranged between 128 million and 238 million as of december 31 2005 the company had a reserve equal to 154 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

income tax contingencies 

the company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the company’s tax position will be ultimately sustained the company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the company’s tax position will ultimately be sustained which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item the company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax matters actual results may differ from the recorded amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant to the company’s policies natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

  the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 

the company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form 1 offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows 2 structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk 3 converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4 avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency in addition the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company’s consolidated statements of operations 

the company purchases certain raw materials including resin corrugate steel and aluminum which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain a variety of programs including periodic raw material purchases purchases of raw materials for future delivery longterm contracts and price adjustments help the company mitigate this risk where practical the company uses derivatives to help manage the volatility related to this risk in 2005 the company experienced raw material inflation of approximately 153 million primarily in resin and steel partially offset by pricing increases of approximately 132 million 

the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variancecovariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 in millions except percentages 

 

the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

the 95 confidence interval signifies the company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company’s favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is considered highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets 31

capabilities and electronic communications the company manufactures the vast majority of its products and has extensive experience in highvolume costeffective manufacturing the highvolume nature of its manufacturing processes and the relatively consistent demand for its products enable the company to ship most products directly from its factories without the need for independent warehousing and distribution centers foreign operations information regarding the company’s 2003 2002 and 2001 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area are included in footnote 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein raw materials the company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements the raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities backlog the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material seasonal variations the company’s product groups are only moderately affected by seasonal trends the cleaning and organization business segment typically has higher sales in the second half of the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season the tools and hardware and home fashions business segments typically have higher sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased level of doityourself projects completed in the summer months and the office products business segment has higher sales in the second and third quarters due to the backtoschool season because these seasonal trends are moderate the company’s consolidated quarterly sales do not fluctuate significantly unless a significant acquisition is made patents and trademarks the company has many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are in the aggregate increasingly important to its business the company believes that no individual patent trademark brand name or trade name other than the united states registered “rubbermaid” trademark is material to its consolidated operations competition the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products many of which are large and wellestablished the company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs and office superstores the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers this environment significantly limits the company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices other trends among retailers are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers to demand that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times another trend in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong enduser brands is for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in customer service for more than 30 years the company has positioned itself to respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers the company markets its strong 9

typically operating segments or operations one level below operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for the reporting units the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes prices and costs considering all available information at the date of review as a result of this analysis the company recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 5380 million in the first quarter of 2002 with an aftertax charge totaling 5149 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company began exploring various options for certain businesses in the home fashions and other segments including evaluating those businesses for potential sale as this process progressed the company obtained a better indication of the market value of these businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of their fair value as a result the company conducted a new impairment test in the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment loss of 2420 million related to goodwill to write the net assets of these businesses to fair value the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business units there is potential for economic regulatory or other conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business unit to generate future cash flows should these conditions deteriorate there is the potential for additional impairment losses to be incurred and such losses could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements legal and environmental reserves as described in footnote 17 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business these proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the company’s products allegations of infringement of intellectual property commercial disputes and employment matters as well as environmental matters some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages and a few proceedings purport to be class actions in determining the appropriate level of legal reserves the company evaluates the potential exposure on specific claims the company evaluates the range of estimated loss for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based largely on historical experience while the company believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures management cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved the ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations including matters in which the company has been identified by the us environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at contaminated sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and equivalent state laws in assessing its environmental response costs the company has considered several factors including the extent of the company’s volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other prps the kind of waste the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements the financial ability of other prps to share in the payment of requisite costs the company’s prior experience with similar sites environmental studies and cost estimates available to the company the effects of inflation on cost estimates and the extent to which the company’s and other parties’ status as prps is disputed the company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december 31 2003 ranged between 145 million and 199 million as of december 31 2003 the company had a reserve equal to 178 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate no insurance recovery was taken into 34

   customer service
   

   the company believes that one of the primary ways it distinguishes
   itself from its competitors is through customer service the companys
   ability to provide superior customer service is a result of its
   information technology marketing and merchandising programs designed
   to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and consistent
   ontime delivery of its products

   ontime delivery
   

   a critical element of the companys customer service is consistent
   ontime delivery of products to its customers  retailers are pursuing
   a number of strategies to deliver the highestquality bestcost
   products to their customers  a growing trend among retailers is to
   purchase on a justintime basis in order to reduce inventory costs
   and increase returns on investment  as retailers shorten their lead
   times for orders manufacturers need to more closely anticipate
   consumerbuying patterns  the company supports its retail customers
   justintime inventory strategies through investments in improved
   forecasting systems more responsive manufacturing and distribution
   capabilities and electronic communications  the company manufactures
   the vast majority of its products and has extensive experience in
   highvolume costeffective manufacturing  the highvolume nature of
   its manufacturing processes and the relatively consistent demand for
   its products enables the company to ship most products directly from
   its factories without the need for independent warehousing and
   distribution centers

   foreign operations
   

   information regarding the companys 2002 2001 and 2000 foreign
   operations is included in footnote 14 to the consolidated financial
   statements and is incorporated by reference herein

   substantially all of its material requirements  the raw materials and
   various purchased components required for its products have generally
   been available in sufficient quantities

   backlog
   

   the dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material

   seasonal variations
   

   the companys product groups are only moderately affected by seasonal
   trends  the rubbermaid and calphalon home business segments typically
   have higher sales in the second half of the year due to retail
   stocking related to the holiday season the irwin business segment has
   higher sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased
   level of doityourself projects completed in the summer months and
   the sharpie business segment has higher sales in the second and third
   quarters due to the backtoschool season  because these seasonal
   trends are moderate the companys consolidated quarterly sales do not
   fluctuate significantly unless a significant acquisition is made

   patents and trademarks
   

   the company has many patents trademarks brand names and trade names
   that are in the aggregate increasingly important to its business
   the company believes that no individual patent trademark brand name
   or trade name other than the united states registered rubbermaid
   trademark is material to its consolidated operations

   competition
   

   the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and
   distributors of consumer products many of which are large and
   wellestablished  the companys principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs
   and office superstores  the rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory
   retailers many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers
   this environment significantly limits the companys ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices  other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times  another trend in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong enduser brands is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources
   the combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the companys principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing

   facilities

   cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was 8689 million
   compared to 8654 million in 2001 and 6235 million in 2000  the
   increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved earnings
   before noncash charges and improved working capital management
   principally in the area of accounts payable  in 2002 the company
   generated 1360 million in positive cash flow by better management of
   accounts payable  as a result the company generated free cash flow
   defined by the company as cash provided by operating activities less
   capital expenditures and dividends of 3924 million compared to
   3916 million in 2001 and 818 million in 2000

   the company has shortterm foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks that are available for shortterm financing
   borrowings under the companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject
   to the discretion of the lender the companys lines of credit do not
   have a material impact on the companys liquidity  borrowings under
   the companys lines of credit at december 31 2002 totaled 252
   million

   mediumterm notes and the entire amount is considered to be longterm
   debt

                                     36


   the company completed a 13000 million syndicated revolving credit
   facility the revolver on june 14 2002 replacing the existing
   13000 million revolving credit agreement which was scheduled to
   terminate in august 2002  the revolver consists of a 6500 million
   364day credit agreement and a 6500 million fiveyear credit
   agreement  at december 31 2002 there were no borrowings under the
   revolver

   in lieu of borrowings under the revolver the company may issue up to
   13000 million of commercial paper  the revolver provides the
   committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper
   accordingly commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount
   available for borrowing under the revolver  at december 31 2002
   1400 million principal amount of commercial paper was outstanding
   because 6500 million of the revolver expires in june 2007 the
   entire 1400 million is classified as longterm debt

   the revolver permits the company to borrow funds on a variety of
   interest rate terms  the revolver requires among other things that
   the company maintain certain interest coverage and total indebtedness
   to total capital ratio as defined in the agreement  the agreement
   also limits subsidiary indebtedness  as of december 31 2002 the
   company was in compliance with this agreement

   financial institution creating a financing entity that is consolidated
   in the companys financial statements  under the agreement the
   company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity
   to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the companys
   united states trade receivables to the financing entity  in the
   quarter ended september 30 2001 the financing entity issued 4500
   million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution
   those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the
   company can have access to the financing entitys receivables  the
   receivables and the corresponding 4500 million preferred debt issued
   by the subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded in the
   consolidated accounts of the company  the proceeds of this debt were
   used to pay down commercial paper issued by the company  because this
   debt matures in 2008 the entire amount is considered to be longterm
   debt  the provisions of the debt agreement allow the entire
   outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including the
   companys debt rating falling below investment grade and certain
   levels of accounts receivable writeoffs  as of december 31 2002
   the company was in compliance with the agreement  as of december 31
   2002 and 2001 the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold
   under the agreement was 7382 million and 6893 million
   respectively

   in august 2002 the company elected to terminate certain interest rate
   swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities and received cash
   of 250 million  of this amount 208 million represents the fair
   value of the swaps that were terminated and the remainder represents

                                     37


   interest receivable on the swaps  the cash received relating to the
   fair value of the swaps was included as an operating activity in the
   consolidated statement of cash flows  the unamortized fair value gain
   on the terminated interest rate swaps is accounted for as longterm
   debt  as of december 31 2002 the unamortized gain was 184
   million of which 53 million is classified as current portion of
   longterm debt  the unamortized gain will be amortized as a reduction
   to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt

   in august 2002 the company entered into several new interest rate
   swap agreements to replace the terminated interest rate swap
   agreements  these new interest rate swaps convert certain fixed rate
   debt into floating rate debt based on a notional principal amount of
   5000 million

   a 5000 million universal shelf registration statement became
   effective in july 2002 under which debt and equity securities may be
   issued  as of december 31 2002 approximately 2500 million in debt
   securities had been issued under this shelf registration statement
   in january 2003 approximately 2008 million in equity securities
   were issued pursuant to the shelf registration  see footnote 16 to
   the consolidated financial statements for further details

   uses

   the companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include
   acquisitions dividend payments and capital expenditures

   cash used for acquisitions was 2422 million 1075 million and
   5978 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000
   respectively  the company continues to invest in businesses and
   product lines that present a strategic fit with the companys existing
   businesses  see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements
   for further details

   the company repaid 9015 million 8190 million and 4282 million
   of notes payable and longterm debt for the years ended december 31
   2002 2001 and 2000 respectively  the companys ability to pay down
   debt was due primarily to current year cash earnings and continued
   focus on working capital management  cash used for restructuring
   activities was 580 million 497 million and 329 million in the
   years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively  such cash
   payments primarily represent employee termination benefits and
   facility exit costs

   capital expenditures were 2521 million 2498 million and 3166
   million in the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000
   respectively  the company continues to invest in new product
   development and productivity  aggregate dividends paid were 2244
   million 2240 million and 2251 million in the years ended december
   31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively


                                     38


   retained earnings decreased 4281 million in the year ended december
   31 2002  the reduction in retained earnings is due primarily to the
   5149 million net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge taken
   in 2002 and the payment of 2244 million in dividends partially
   offset by current year earnings

   working capital at december 31 2002 was 4656 million compared to
   3168 million at december 31 2001  the current ratio at december
   31 2002 was 1181 compared to 1131 at december 31 2001  the
   increase in working capital and the current ratio is due to the
   american tool acquisition and a reduction in the current portion of
   longterm debt

   total debt to total capitalization total debt is net of cash and cash
   equivalents and total capitalization includes total debt company
   obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a
   subsidiary trust and stockholders equity was 471 at december 31
   2002 compared to 431 at december 31 2001  the increase in total
   debt to total capitalization is due to the american tool acquisition
   which was funded by the issuance of commercial paper

   the company believes that cash provided by operations and available
   borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the
   cash needs of existing businesses however certain events such as
   significant acquisitions could require additional external financing
   in january 2003 the company completed its acquisition of the american
   saw  mfg co american saw  the purchase price of 4500 million
   was funded through the issuance of commercial paper  see footnote 16
   to the consolidated financial statement for further details

   minimum pension liability

   the recent dramatic decline in us equity markets has reduced the
   value of the companys pension plan assets  as a result the
   companys pension plan which historically has had an overfunded
   position currently is underfunded  in accordance with sfas no 87
   employers accounting for pensions the company recorded an
   additional minimum pension liability adjustment at december 31 2002
   based on plan asset values at the measurement date the approximate
   effect of this noncash adjustment was to increase the pension
   liability by 1145 million with a corresponding charge to equity
   net of taxes of 710 million  the direct charge to stockholders
   equity did not affect net income but is included in other
   comprehensive income  the company remains confident that its pension
   plan has the appropriate longterm investment strategy and the
   companys liquidity position is expected to remain strong

   critical accounting policies

   the companys accounting policies are more fully described in footnote
   1 to the consolidated financial statements  as disclosed in footnote
   1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with

                                     39


   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts
   reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes
   future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute
   certainty  therefore the determination of estimates requires the
   exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from
   those estimates and such differences may be material to the
   consolidated financial statements  the following sections describe
   the companys critical accounting policies

   goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets

   effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 goodwill
   and other intangible assets  under sfas no 142 goodwill and
   intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized
   but remain subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with the
   statements

   the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and
   indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter  in addition
   the company tests for impairment periodically if events or
   circumstances occur subsequent to the companys annual impairment
   tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
   reporting unit below its carrying amount  in conducting this
   impairment test the company estimates the future cash flows of its
   businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles
   relate  these cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from 9
   to 13 reflecting the respective specific industrys cost of capital
   the discounted cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of
   the reporting unit to determine if an impairment exists  if upon
   review the fair value is less than the carrying value of the
   reporting unit the carrying value is written down to estimated fair
   value  reporting units are typically operating segments or operations
   one level below operating segments for which discrete financial
   information is available and for which segment management regularly
   reviews the operating results  because there usually is a lack of
   quoted market prices for the reporting units the fair value usually
   is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using
   discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset
   group  the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and
   related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of
   future production volumes prices and costs considering all available
   information at the date of review

   as a result of this analysis the company recorded a pretax goodwill
   impairment charge of 5380 million in the first quarter of 2002 with
   an aftertax charge totaling 5149 million

   the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life
   intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to
   period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash
   flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business

                                     40


   units  there is potential for economic regulatory or other
   conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business
   unit to generate future cash flows  should these conditions
   deteriorate there is the potential for additional impairment losses
   to be incurred and such losses could be material to the companys
   consolidated financial statements

   legal and environmental reserves

   as described in footnote 15 to the companys consolidated financial
   statements the company is involved in legal proceedings in the
   ordinary course of its business  these proceedings include claims for
   damages arising out of use of the companys products allegations of
   infringement of intellectual property commercial disputes and
   employment matters as well as environmental matters  some of the
   legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
   damages and a few proceedings purport to be class actions

   in determining the appropriate level of legal reserves the company
   uses outside and internal counsel to evaluate the potential exposure
   on specific claims  the company evaluates the range of estimated loss
   for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based on
   historical experience and the advice of counsel  while the company
   believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures management
   cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases
   including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts
   reserved  the ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the
   amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the companys
   consolidated financial statements

   the company is involved in various matters concerning federal and
   state environmental laws and regulations including matters in which
   the company has been identified by the us environmental protection
   agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially
   responsible party prp at contaminated sites under the federal
   comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
   cercla and equivalent state laws

   in assessing its environmental response costs the company has
   considered several factors including the extent of the companys
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other prps
   the kind of waste the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements the financial ability of other prps to share in
   the payment of requisite costs the companys prior experience with
   similar sites environmental studies and cost estimates available to
   the company the effects of inflation on cost estimates and the
   extent to which the companys and other parties status as prps is
   disputed

   the companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with
   these matters as of december 31 2002 ranged between 194 million and
   246 million  as of december 31 2002 the company had a reserve

                                     41


   equal to 220 million for such environmental response costs in the
   aggregate no insurance recovery was taken into account in determining
   the companys cost estimates or reserve nor do the companys cost
   estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value
   purposes except with respect to two longterm 30 year operations
   and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value

   because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities the possibility that the
   company could be identified as a prp at sites identified in the future
   that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
   possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired
   actual costs to be incurred by the company may vary from the companys
   estimates  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the
   amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be
   material to the companys consolidated financial statements

   product liability reserves

   the company has a selfinsurance program for product liability that
   includes reserves for selfretained losses and certain excess and
   aggregate risk transfer insurance  the company uses historical loss
   experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods review of
   significant individual files application of risk transfer programs
   and guidance from internal and external legal counsel in determining
   required product liability reserves  as a result of the most recent
   analysis the company has estimated these reserves at 278 million
   while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these
   claims the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts
   recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to
   the companys consolidated financial statements

   recovery of accounts receivable

   the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based
   on a combination of factors  when aware of a specific customers
   inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of
   bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating
   results or financial position the company records a specific reserve
   for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the
   company reasonably believes is collectible  the company also records
   reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of
   factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and
   historical collection experience  if circumstances related to
   specific customers change the companys estimates of the
   recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted

   inventory reserves

   the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and
   slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the
   cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon

                                     42


   assumptions about future demand and market conditions  if actual
   market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
   management additional inventory writedowns may be required

   revenue recognition

   the company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers net
   of provisions for cash discounts returns volume or trade customer
   discounts coop advertising and other sales discounts upon shipment
   to customers when all substantial risks of ownership change in
   accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 0010
   accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs the company
   records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling
   as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost
   of products sold  see footnote 1 to the consolidated financial
   statements

   international operations

   the companys nonus business continues to grow at a steady pace
   this growth outside the us has been fueled by recent international
   acquisitions primarily in europe  for the years ended december 31
   2002 2001 and 2000 the companys nonus business accounted for
   approximately 27 27 and 25 of net sales respectively see

   market risk

   the companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates
   foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant
   to the companys policies natural hedging techniques and derivative
   financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse


                                     43


   changes in market prices the company does not hold or issue
   derivative instruments for trading purposes

   the companys primary market risk is interest rate exposure primarily
   in the united states the company manages interest rate exposure
   through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and
   floating rate debt interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest
   rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions and for
   qualifying hedges the interest differential of swaps is included in
   interest expense

   the companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
   hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial
   transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form

            offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows
            structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with
             appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net
             investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion
             risk
            converting excess foreign currency deposits into us
             dollars or the relevant functional currency and
            avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the
             appropriate functional currency

   in addition the company utilizes shortterm forward contracts to
   hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and losses
   related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions derivative instruments are recorded on the companys
   consolidated balance sheet at fair value and any changes in fair
   value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement
   of income or other comprehensive income

   due to the diversity of its product lines the company does not have
   material sensitivity to any one commodity the company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts

   the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic
   loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either
   interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk
   estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign
   exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and
   correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in
   fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including
   substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding
   equitymethod investments  the fair value losses shown in the table
   below do not have an impact on current results of operations or
   financial condition but are shown as an illustration of the impact of
   potential adverse changes in interest rates  the following table

                                     44


   indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december
   31 2002 and 2001 in millions



                             2002       december 31         2001        december 31      confidence
        market risk        average          2002           average           2001             level
                                          
                                                                               
   interest rates           182           205           107             145           95

   the 95 confidence interval signifies the companys degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above  the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   companys favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse  actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly
   unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses because actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

   euro currency conversion

   on january 1 1999 the euro became the common legal currency for 11
   of the 15 member countries of the european union  on that date the
   participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing
   sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro on january 4
   1999 the euro began trading on currency exchanges and became
   available for noncash transactions if the parties elected to use it
   on january 1 2001 another country greece also adopted the euro
   fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency  the legacy
   currencies remained legal tender through december 31 2001  on january
   1 2002 participating countries introduced eurodenominated bills and
   coins and effective july 1 2002 legacy currencies were no longer
   legal tender

   all businesses in participating countries are now required to conduct
   all transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records
   and reports to be eurobased  the company has completed this
   conversion process and has deemed its information systems to be euro
   compliant  as a result of the euro conversion the company
   experienced no adverse impact to its business or financial condition
   on a consolidated basis

   competition
   

   the company competes with numerous other manufacturers and
   distributors of consumer products many of which are large and well
   established  the companys principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs
   and office superstores  the rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory
   retailers many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers
   this environment significantly limits the companys ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices  other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times  another trend in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong enduser brands is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources
   the combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the companys principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing
   introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in
   customer service

   for more than 30 years the company has positioned itself to respond
   to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong
   relationships with large highvolume purchasers  the company markets
   its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every category of
   highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery and variety
   chains warehouse clubs department hardware and specialty stores

   primary reasons for changes
   1  internal sales decline primarily due to shelf space losses at key
        customers and a significant downturn in the us economy
   2  4985 million of sales contribution from the paper mateparker
        acquisition december 2000 offset by internal sales decline of
        88 primarily due to softness in the commercial channel and a
        significant downturn in the us economy

       internal sales growthdecline is defined by the company as
        growthdecline from its core businesses which include continuing
        businesses owned more than one year and minor acquisitions

       acquisitions and divestitures are described in footnote 2 to the
        consolidated financial statements

   gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2001 was 270 or
   18627 million versus 263 or 18260 million in 2000
   excluding restructuring related and other charges relating to
   integration costs of recent acquisitions of 74 million 47 million
   after taxes and 79 million 49 million after taxes in 2001 and
   2000 respectively gross income as a percent of net sales was 271
   or 18701 million in 2001 versus 264 or 18339 million in 2000
   this improvement in gross income is primarily due to the
   implementation of a productivity initiative throughout the company and
   contributions from the paper mateparker acquisition  the companys
   productivity objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order
   to become the lowcost supplier to our customers  to achieve
   productivity improvements the company will focus on reducing
   purchasing costs materials handling costs manufacturing
   inefficiencies and excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost
   of manufacturing products  the companys productivity in 2001 was
   affected primarily by the increased costs associated with slowed
   manufacturing in an effort to reduce inventory levels net inventories
   decreased 1488 million during 2001 offset by improved raw material
   costs

   selling general and administrative expenses sga in 2001 were
   169 of net sales or 11682 million versus 130 or 8994


                                     32



   million in 2000  excluding charges relating to integration costs of
   recent acquisitions of 120 million 77 million after taxes and
   88 million 54 million after taxes in 2001 and 2000
   respectively sga as a percent of net sales was 167 or 11562
   million in 2001 compared to 128 or 8906 million in 2000  the
   increase in sga is a result of the paper mateparker acquisition and
   planned investments in marketing initiatives including the companys
   key account and phoenix programs supporting the companys brand
   portfolio and key account strategy

   in 2001 the company introduced the key account program establishing
   sales organizations specifically for walmart the home depot and
   lowes  as part of this program the company established president
   level positions to more effectively manage the relationships with
   these accounts  the program allows the company to present these
   customers with one face to enhance the companys response time and
   understanding of the customers needs to support the best possible
   relationship

   in 2001 the company also introduced its phoenix program  this
   initiative is an actionoriented field sales force consisting of
   approximately 500 recent university graduates  the team works in the
   field primarily within our key account structure performing product
   demonstrations merchandising product interacting with the enduser
   and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel  this
   initiative allows the company to enhance product placement and
   minimize stock outages and together with the key account program to
   maximize shelf space potential  this program implemented july 2001
   gained traction throughout the year  impact from this initiative is
   expected to translate to the consolidated financial statements through
   the impact of shelf space gains going forward

   during 2001 the company recorded pretax restructuring charges
   associated with the companys strategic restructuring plan  the
   restructuring plan is intended to streamline the companys supply
   chain to ensure its position as the low cost global provider
   throughout the companys product portfolio  the plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities  as
   part of this plan the company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 1700 employees
   additionally the company incurred facility exit costs related
   primarily to the closure of 14 facilities four at rubbermaid one at
   parkereldon six at levolorhardware and three at
   calphalonwearever  see footnote 3 to the consolidated financial
   statements for a review of the charges

   during 2000 the company recorded pretax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures in the home decor segment  the company incurred employee
   severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700
   employees terminated in 2000  such costs included severance and

                                     33

   as a percentage of net sales were 08 or 570 million versus 07
   or 519 million for the year ended december 31 2000  the increase
   in goodwill amortization is a result of additional goodwill associated
   with the paper mateparker acquisition in december 2000

   restructuring and other charges of 861 million 548 million after
   taxes in 2001 and 597 million 367 million after taxes in 2000
   operating income was 6570 or 95 of net sales in 2001 versus
   8914 million or 129 of net sales in 2000  the decrease in
   operating margins was primarily due to planned investment in marketing
   initiatives supporting the companys brand portfolio and key account
   strategy

   net nonoperating expenses in 2001 were 23 of net sales or 1550
   million versus 21 or 1462 million in 2000 the increased
   expenses in 2001 are a result of the companys increased average level
   of debt partially offset by lower interest rates

   the effective tax rate was 364 for the year ended december 31 2001
   versus 385 in the prior year  see footnote 12 to the consolidated
   financial statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate

   the same basis decreased 298 to 120 versus 171 in 2000  the
   decrease in net income and earnings per share for 2001 was primarily
   due to internal sales declines and planned investment in the companys
   marketing initiatives

   primary reasons for changes
   1  internal sales growth of 38 enhanced by 306 million of
        sales contribution from the acquisitions of rotring and
        reynolds
   2  internal sales decline of 14 offset by 771 million of
        sales contribution from the acquisitions of ceanothe
        mersch brio and panex
   3  internal sales growth due to shelf space gains at key retailers

   gross income as a percent of net sales in 2000 was 263 or 18260
   million versus 259 or 17364 million in 1999 excluding costs
   associated with the rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and
   other charges of 79 million and 1110 million in 2000 and 1999
   respectively gross income as a percent of net sales was 264 or
   18339 million in 2000 versus 275 or 18474 million in 1999
   this decrease in gross margins in 2000 was primarily attributable to
   lower sales volume and higher material costs

   sga in 2000 was 130 of net sales or 8994 million versus 165
   or 11045 million in 1999 excluding costs associated with the
   rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and other charges of
   88 million and 1788 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively
   sga as a percent of net sales was 128 or 8906 million in 2000
   versus 138 or 9257 million in 1999 the decrease in sga expenses
   is primarily the result of integration cost savings at rubbermaid home
   products rubbermaid europe and little tikes and tight spending control
   throughout the rest of the companys core businesses

   during 2000 the company recorded pretax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures in the home decor segment  the company incurred employee


                                     35


   severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700
   employees terminated in 2000  such costs included severance and
   government mandated settlements for facility closures at rubbermaid
   europe change in control payments made to former rubbermaid
   executives employee terminations at the domestic rubbermaid divisions
   and severance at the home decor segment  the company incurred merger
   transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for
   rubbermaids 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related
   contingencies resolved in 2000  additionally the company incurred
   facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five
   european rubbermaid facilities three window furnishings facilities as
   well as the exit of various rubbermaid product lines see footnote 3
   to the consolidated financial statements for a review of the charges

   during 1999 the company recorded pretax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the integration of the rubbermaid business into
   newell  merger transaction costs related primarily to investment
   banking legal and accounting costs for the newellrubbermaid merger
   employee severance and termination benefits related to approximately
   750 employees terminated in 1999  such costs included change in
   control payments made to former rubbermaid executives and severance
   and termination costs at rubbermaids former headquarters rubbermaid
   home products division little tikes division rubbermaid commercial
   products division and newell divisions  facility and other exit costs
   representing impaired rubbermaid centralized computer software
   abandoned as a result of converting rubbermaid onto existing newell
   centralized computer software and costs related to discontinued
   product lines the closure of seven rubbermaid facilities writeoff
   of assets associated with abandoned projects and impaired assets and
   other exit costs  see footnote 3 to the consolidated financial
   statements for a review of the charges

   goodwill amortization as a percentage of net sales was 07 in 2000
   and 1999

   operating income in 2000 was 120 of net sales or 8317 million
   versus 51 of net sales or 3436 million in 1999 excluding
   restructuring and other charges of 597 million in 2000 and 5314
   million in 1999 operating income was 8914 or 129 of net sales
   in 2000 versus 8750 million or 130 of net sales in 1999

   net nonoperating expenses in 2000 were 21 of net sales or 1462
   million versus 17 or 1127 million in 1999 the increased
   expenses in 2000 are a result of the companys increased level of debt
   and higher interest rates

   for 2000 and 1999 the effective tax rates were 385 and 587
   respectively the higher rate in 1999 was primarily due to
   nondeductible transaction costs associated with the rubbermaid merger
   see footnote 12 to the consolidated financial statements for an
   explanation of the effective tax rate


                                     36

   same basis increased 36 to 171 in 2000 versus 165 in 1999 the
   decrease in net income for 2000 was primarily due to increased raw
   material costs and lower sales volume offset partially by rubbermaid
   integration cost savings tight spending control at other core
   businesses and internal growth diluted earnings per share increased
   in 2000 versus 1999 as a result of the lower share base due to the
   stock repurchase program

   liquidity and capital resources

   sources
   

   the companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
   include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing
   facilities

   cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was 8654 million
   compared to 6235 and 5540 million for 2000 and 1999 respectively
   the increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved
   working capital management principally in the areas of inventory and
   accounts payable  in 2001 the company announced an increased focus
   on working capital which resulted in reduced inventory of 1488
   million and increased accounts payable of 1589 million  as a
   result the company generated free cash flow defined by the company
   as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and
   dividends of 3916 million compared to 818 million and 1281
   million in 2000 and 1999 respectively

   the company has shortterm foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks which are available for shortterm
   financing borrowings under the companys uncommitted lines of credit
   are subject to the discretion of the lender the companys lines of
   credit do not have a material impact on the companys liquidity

   revolving credit agreement

   in lieu of borrowings under the companys revolving credit agreement
   the company may issue up to 13000 million of commercial paper the
   companys revolving credit agreement provides the committed backup
   liquidity required to issue commercial paper accordingly commercial
   paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing
   under the companys revolving credit agreement at december 31 2001
   7075 million principal amount of commercial paper was outstanding
   because the backup revolving credit agreement expires in august 2002
   the entire 7075 million is classified as current portion of long
   term debt the company plans to extend maturities by replacing a
   portion of current debt with longerterm debt facilities  by
   extending maturities the company can reduce its reliance on the
   current commercial paper program



                                     38


   the revolving credit agreement permits the company to borrow funds on
   a variety of interest rate terms the agreement requires among other
   things that the company maintain a certain total indebtedness to
   total capital ratio and limits subsidiary indebtedness as defined in
   the agreement as of december 31 2001 the company was in compliance
   with this agreement

   million principal amount of mediumterm notes the maturities on
   these notes range from 3 to 30 years at an average interest rate of

   financial institution creating a financing entity which is
   consolidated in the companys financial statements  under the
   agreement the company regularly enters into transactions with the
   financing entity to sell an undivided interest in the companys
   receivables  in the quarter ended september 30 2001 the financing
   entity issued 4500 million in preferred debt securities to a
   financial institution  those preferred debt securities must be
   retired or redeemed before the company can have access to the
   financing entitys receivables  the receivables and the corresponding
   4500 million preferred debt issued by the subsidiary to the
   financial institution are recorded on the consolidated accounts of the
   company the proceeds of this debt were used to pay down commercial
   paper  because this debt matures in 2008 the entire amount is
   considered to be longterm debt  the provisions of the debt agreement
   allow the entire outstanding debt to be called upon certain events
   including the companys longterm senior unsecured debt rating falling
   below baa2 moodys or bbb standard  poors and certain levels of
   accounts receivable writeoffs  as of december 31 2001 the company

   in 2001 the company made payments on longterm debt net of proceeds
   of 3547 million compared to net additional borrowings of 8368
   million in 2000 and 1947 million in 1999  the companys ability to
   pay down additional debt was due primarily to increased focus on
   working capital management primarily inventory and accounts payable
   and current year cash earnings

   cash used for restructuring activities was 497 million 329
   million and 1455 million for the years ended december 31 2001 2000
   and 1999 respectively  such payments represent primarily employee
   termination benefits and facility closure and other exit costs related
   to the companys strategic restructuring plan and recent acquisitions

   capital expenditures were 2498 million 3166 million and 2001
   million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively aggregate dividends paid
   during 2001 2000 and 1999 were 2240 2251 million and 2258
   million respectively

   on february 7 2000 the company announced a stock repurchase program
   of up to 5000 million of the companys outstanding common stock
   during 2000 the company repurchased 155 million shares of its common
   stock at an average price of 26 per share for a total cash price of
   4030 million under the program the repurchase program remained in
   effect until december 31 2000 and was financed through the use of
   working capital and commercial paper

   retained earnings increased in 2001 and 2000 by 404 million and
   1963 million respectively the decrease in the earnings growth rate
   between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to reduced net income from
   lower than expected sales volume and planned investment in marketing
   initiatives supporting the companys brand portfolio and key account
   strategy

   working capital at december 31 2001 was 3168 million compared to
   13295 million at december 31 2000 and 11087 million at december
   31 1999  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to

                                     40


   reclassifying 7075 million in longterm debt in 2000 as current in
   2001 as discussed above and the companys increased focus on working
   capital management

   the current ratio at december 31 2000 was 1131 compared to 1861
   at december 31 2000 and 1681 at december 31 1999

   total debt to total capitalization total debt is net of cash and cash
   equivalents and total capitalization includes total debt company
   obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a
   subsidiary trust and stockholders equity was 431 at december 31
   2001 461 at december 31 2000 and 331 at december 31 1999

   the company believes that cash provided from operations and borrowing
   facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash
   needs of existing businesses however certain events such as
   significant acquisitions could require additional external financing

   critical accounting policies

   the companys accounting policies are more fully described in footnote
   1 of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as
   disclosed in footnote 1 the preparation of financial statements in
   conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that
   affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
   accompanying footnotes  future events and their effects cannot be
   determined with absolute certainty  therefore the determination of
   estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results
   inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may
   be material to the consolidated financial statements

   the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation
   of the companys financial statements include estimates as to the
   recovery of accounts receivable inventory goodwill and other long
   lived assets as well as those used in the determination of liabilities
   related to litigation product liability customer discounts
   taxation restructuring postretirement and pension benefits and
   environmental matters  various assumptions and other factors underlie
   the determination of these significant estimates  the process of
   determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into
   account factors such as historical experience current and expected
   economic conditions product mix and in some cases actuarial
   techniques  the company reevaluates these significant factors as
   facts and circumstances dictate  historically actual results have
   not differed significantly from those determined using the estimates
   described above

   sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers net of
   provisions for cash discounts returns customer discounts such as
   volume or trade coop advertising and other sales discounts are


                                     41


   recognized as revenue upon shipment to customers and when all
   substantial risks of ownership change

   recent accounting pronouncements

   at the beginning of 2001 the company adopted statement of financial
   accounting standards fas no 133 accounting for derivative
   instruments and hedging activities  this statement requires
   companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or
   liabilities measured at fair value  any changes in fair value of
   these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other
   comprehensive income  the impact of adopting fas no 133 on january
   1 2001 resulted in a cumulative aftertax gain of approximately 130
   million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  the
   cumulative effect of adopting fas no 133 did not materially impact
   the results of operations

   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards boards fasb
   issued fas no 141 business combinations and fas no 142
   goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 141 requires all
   business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted
   for using the purchase method of accounting historically all
   acquisitions by the company have been accounted for as purchases thus
   there was no effect on the companys consolidated financial statements
   upon adoption of this standard in contrast all mergers have been
   accounted for as poolings of interest  fas no 142 becomes effective
   in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 with early adoption
   permitted the company plans to early adopt the provisions of fas no
   142 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 in accordance with
   this standard goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be
   subject to annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue
   based test all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
   over their estimated useful lives goodwill amortization expense was
   570 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2001 the
   company anticipates that the application of the nonamortization
   provisions will increase annual net income by approximately 410
   million or 015 per share during 2001 and the first quarter 2002
   the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and
   indefinite lived intangible assets as of january 1 2002  subject to
   final analysis the company expects to record a pretax goodwill
   impairment charge of 5000 million to 5500 million in the first
   quarter of 2002

   in august 2001 the fasb issued fas no 144  accounting for
   impairment of disposal of longlived assets this statement
   established a single accounting model for longlived assets to be
   disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance
   for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than
   by sale the statement supersedes fas no 121 accounting for the
   impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be
   disposed of and amends the accounting and reporting provisions of
   accounting principles board apb opinion no 30 related to the

                                     42


   disposal of a segment of a business the statement is effective for
   fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 the company adopted
   fas no 144 on january 1 2002 and the standard did not have a
   material impact on its financial position or results of operations

   in august 2001 the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf
   no 0109 accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer
   or a reseller of vendors product which codified and reconciled the
   task forces consensuses in eitf 0014 accounting for certain sales
   incentives eitf 0022 accounting for points and certain other time
   based sales incentives or volume based sales incentive offers and
   offers of free products or services to be delivered in the future
   and eitf 0025 vendor income statement characterization of
   consideration paid to a reseller of the vendors products  these
   eitfs prescribe guidance regarding the timing of recognition and
   income statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales
   incentive programs to resellers and end consumers  eitf no 0109 did
   not impact results of operations because the company recognizes sales
   incentives upon recognition of revenue and classifies them as
   reductions of gross revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of
   goods sold when shipped both in accordance with the prescribed rules

   in may 2000 the eitf issued eitf no 0010 accounting for shipping
   and handling fees and costs  eitf no 0010 requires that amounts
   billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be
   classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and
   handling be classified as a cost of products sold  historically
   these revenues and costs had been netted together and deducted from
   gross sales to arrive at net sales  the net sales and cost of
   products sold have been restated for this change  the impact of this
   change increased net sales and cost of products sold by 2861 million
   and 2987 million for the years ended december 31 2000 and december
   31 1999 respectively  there was no impact on gross income resulting
   from this change

   legal and environmental matters

   the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims including
   various environmental matters in the ordinary course of its business
   such legal proceedings are more fully described in footnote 15 to the
   companys consolidated financial statements although management of
   the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal
   proceedings with certainty it believes that the ultimate resolution
   of the companys legal proceedings including any amounts it may have
   to pay in excess of amounts reserved will not have a material effect
   on the companys consolidated financial statements

   market risk

   the companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates
   foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices pursuant
   to the companys policies natural hedging techniques and derivative
   financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse
   changes in market prices the company does not hold or issue
   derivative instruments for trading purposes

   the companys primary market risk is interest rate exposure primarily
   in the united states the company manages interest rate exposure
   through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and
   floating rate debt interest rate exposure was reduced significantly
   in 1997 from the issuance of 5000 million 525 companyobligated
   mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a
   subsidiary trust the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper
   interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when
   appropriate based on market conditions and for qualifying hedges
   the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense

   the companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
   hedging anticipated intercompany and thirdparty commercial
   transaction exposures of oneyear duration or less the company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form

       offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows

       structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate
        levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and
        subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk

       converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or
        the relevant functional currency and

       avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate
        functional currency

   in addition the company utilizes shortterm forward contracts to
   hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and losses
   related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions derivative instruments are recorded on the companys
   balance sheet at fair value and any changes in fair value of these
   instruments are recorded in the income statement or other
   comprehensive income

   due to the diversity of its product lines the company does not have
   material sensitivity to any one commodity the company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts
   the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic
   loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either

                                     45


   interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the valueatrisk
   estimation model the valueatrisk model uses historical foreign
   exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and
   correlation of these rates in future periods it estimates a loss in
   fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including
   substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding
   equitymethod investments the fair value losses shown in the table
   below do not have an impact on current results of operations or
   financial condition but are shown as an illustration of the impact of
   adverse changes in interest rates

                                          time      confidence
                               amount    period       level
                                        
    in millions
    interest rates             145      1 day        95
    foreign exchange            05      1 day        95

   the 95 confidence interval signifies the companys degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   companys favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly
   unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses since actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

   euro currency conversion

   on january 1 1999 the euro became the common legal currency for 11
   of the 15 member countries of the european union  on that date the
   participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing
   sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro on january 4
   1999 the euro began trading on currency exchanges and became
   available for noncash transactions if the parties elected to use it
   on january 1 2001 another country greece also adopted the euro
   fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency  the legacy
   currencies remained legal tender through december 31 2001 on january
   1 2002 participating countries introduced eurodenominated bills and
   coins and effective july 1 2002 legacy currencies will no longer be
   legal tender

   after the dual currency phase all businesses in participating
   countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert
   their financial records and reports to be eurobased the company has
   substantially completed this conversion process and has deemed its
   information systems to be euro compliant  as a result of the euro
   conversion the company experienced no adverse impact to its business
   or financial condition on a consolidated basis

   infantjuvenile care  play and food preparation cooking  serving
   business segments typically have higher sales in the second half of
   the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season the

   doityourself projects completed in the summer months and the office

   distributors of consumer products many of which are large and

                                     13





   wellestablished  the companys principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers such as discount stores home centers warehouse clubs
   and office superstores  the rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers together with changes in consumer shopping patterns
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory
   retailers many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers
   this environment significantly limits the companys ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices  other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times  another trend in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong enduser brands is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources
   the combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the companys principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong enduser brands the ongoing
   introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in
   customer service

        for more than 30 years the company has positioned itself to
   respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing
   strong relationships with large highvolume purchasers  the company
   markets its strong multiproduct offering through virtually every
   category of highvolume retailer including discount drug grocery
   and variety chains warehouse clubs department hardware and
   specialty stores home centers office superstores contract

   walmart including sams club accounted for approximately 15 of
   net sales in 2000  other top ten customers included toys r us the
   home depot kmart target lowes the office depot jcpenney united
   stationers and sears

     internal growth

     6 internal growth plus sales from the mckechnie acquisition
        october 1999

       internal growth is defined by the company as growth from its core
        businesses which include continuing businesses owned more than
        two years and minor acquisitions

       acquisitions and divestitures are described in note 2 to the
        consolidated financial statements

        gross income as a percent of net sales in 2000 was 264 or
   18316 million versus 259 or 17412 million in 1999 excluding
   costs associated with the rubbermaid merger and certain realignment
   and other charges of 24 million and 1062 million in 2000 and 1999
   respectively gross income as a percent of net sales was 264 in 2000
   versus 275 in 1999 this decrease in gross margins in 2000 was
   primarily attributable to lower than anticipated sales volume and
   higher than expected material costs

        selling general and administrative expenses sga in 2000
   were 130 of net sales or 8994 million versus 164 or 11045 in
   1999 excluding costs associated with the rubbermaid merger and
   certain realignment and other charges of 87 million and 1788
   million in 2000 and 1999 respectively sga as a percent of net sales
   was 128 or 8907 million in 2000 versus 138 or 9256 million in
   1999 the decrease in sga expenses is primarily the result of
   integration cost savings at rubbermaid home products rubbermaid
   europe and little tikes and tight spending control throughout the rest
   of the companys core businesses



                                     26





        the company recorded restructuring charges of 486 million in

   million in 1999 operating income was 8914 or 129 of net sales in
   2000 versus 8750 million or 130 of net sales in 1999

        other nonoperating expenses in 2000 were 21 of net sales or
   1462 million versus 17 or 1127 million in 1999 the increased
   expenses in 2000 are a result of the companys increased level of debt
   and higher interest rates

        for 2000 and 1999 the effective tax rates were 385 and 587
   respectively the higher rate in 1999 was primarily due to
   nondeductible transaction costs associated with the rubbermaid merger
   see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for an
   explanation of the effective tax rate

        net income for 2000 was 4216 million representing an increase
   of 3262 million from 1999 basic and diluted earnings per share in

   charges of 5314 million 3696 million after taxes net income in
   1999 was 4650 million diluted earnings per share calculated on the
   same basis increased 36 to 171 in 2000 versus 165 in 1999 the
   decrease in net income for 2000 was primarily due to increased raw
   material costs and softer than expected sales volume offset partially
   by rubbermaid integration cost savings tight spending control at
   other core businesses and internal growth diluted earnings per share
   increased in 2000 versus 1999 as a result of the lower share base due
   to the stock repurchase program


   1999 vs 1998
   

        net sales for 1999 were 67118 million representing an

   realignment and other charges of 1062 million and 279 million in
   1999 and 1998 respectively gross income as a percent of net sales
   was 275 in 1999 versus 285 in 1998 this decrease in gross margins
   in 1999 was primarily attributable to promotional commitments made
   prior to the rubbermaid merger which affected first half 1999 results
   at rubbermaid home products higher than expected resin and other
   material costs which affected second half 1999 results and operating
   inefficiencies at certain glassware and window treatments facilities

        selling general and administrative expenses sga in 1999
   were 164 of net sales or 11045 million versus 149 or 9679
   million in 1998 excluding costs associated with the rubbermaid and
   calphalon mergers and certain realignment and other charges of 1788
   million and 236 million in 1999 and 1998 respectively sga as a
   percent of net sales was 138 or 9257 million versus 145 or
   9443 million in 1998 this decrease in sga expenses is primarily
   due to sga savings as a result of integrating rubbermaid into newell

   income was 8750 million or 130 in 1999 versus 8620 million or
   133 in 1998

        other nonoperating expenses in 1999 were 17 of net sales or
   1127 million versus other nonoperating income of 21 or 1366
   million in 1998 the 2493 million difference was due primarily to a
   1998 net pretax gain of 1915 million on the sale of the companys
   stake in the black  decker corporation and 1998 net pretax gains of
   598 million on the divestitures of stuart hall newell plastics and
   decora this was offset partially by 37 million of rubbermaid merger
   transaction costs in 1998

        for 1999 and 1998 the effective tax rates were 587 and 410

            converting excess foreign currency deposits into us
             dollars or the relevant functional currency and

            avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the
             appropriate functional currency

        in addition the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased
   options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions gains and
   losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked
   to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the
   consolidated statements of income

        due to the diversity of its product lines the company  does not
   have material sensitivity to any one commodity the company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts

        the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential
   economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in
   either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the
   valueatrisk estimation model the valueatrisk model uses
   historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the
   volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods it
   estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling
   techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures
   specifically excluding equitymethod investments the fair value
   losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of
   operations or financial condition as they represent economic not
   financial losses

        the 95 confidence interval signifies the companys degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   companys favor the valueatrisk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time and it is highly
   unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time these amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses since actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets

   euro currency conversion

        on january 1 1999 the euro became the common legal currency
   for 11 of the 15 member countries of the european union on that date
   the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their
   existing sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro on
   january 4 1999 the euro began trading on currency exchanges and
   became available for noncash transactions if the parties elected to
   use it the legacy currencies will remain legal tender through
   december 31 2001 beginning january 1 2002 participating countries
   will introduce eurodenominated bills and coins and effective july 1
   2002 legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender

        after the dual currency phase all businesses in participating
   countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert
   their financial records and reports to be eurobased the company has
   commenced an internal analysis of the euro conversion process to
   prepare its information technology systems for the conversion and
   analyze related risks and issues such as the benefit of the decreased
   exchange rate risk in crossborder transactions involving
   participating countries and the impact of increased price transparency
   on crossborder competition in these countries

        the company believes that the euro conversion process will not
   have a material impact on the companys businesses or financial
   condition on a consolidated basis
